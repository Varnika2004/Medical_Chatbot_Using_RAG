There are numerous reasons why the cure rate is not 100%. Some of Dr. Mohs data revealed a cure rate as low as 96%, but these were often very large tumor, and previously been treated by other modalities. Some authors claim that their 5 year cure rate for primary basal cell cancer exceeded 99% while other noted more conservative cure rate of 97%. The quoted cure rate for Mohs surgery on previously treated basal cell cancer is about 94%. \\n1. Modern frozen section method. Frozen section histology does not give the added margin of safety by the cytotoxic Mohs paste,  originally used by Dr. Mohs. This paste might have destroyed any residual cancer cells not detected by the pathologist.\\n2. Missing epidermal margins. Ideally, the Mohs section should include 100% of the epidermal margin, but greater than 95% is often accepted.  Unfortunately, vigorous scrubbing, poorly controlled initial curettage, poor tissue health, technician\\'s error, and surgeon\\'s error can introduce areas missing epithelial margin. Some surgeon consider 70% epithelial margin acceptable, while other suggests 100% margin. In the ideal situation, 100% of the epithelial margin should be available to be reviewed on serial sectioning of the Mohs specimen.\\n3. Misreading of the pathology slide. It is difficult to differentiate between a small island of basal cell carcinoma and a hair follicle structure. Many Mohs surgeon limits their tissue processing to include only 2 sections of tissue.  This severely hampers their ability to determine if a structure is a hair follicle or a carcinoma. Two histologic sections can not fully distinguish these two nearly identical structures,  and can lead to either \"false negative\" or \"false positive\" errors by either calling a section clear of tumor, or calling a section positive for tumor, respectively. Serial sectioning of the tumor is preferred by other surgeons.  Surgeons who performs serial sectioning through the block of tissue (usually 100 micrometres apart) are assured the contiguous nature of his tumor, the distance of the tumor from the surgical margin, and is familiarized with the nature of the tumor. Serial sectioning also makes it easier to work with three dimensional tumor with difficult to compress margins.\\n4. Compression artifact, freezing artifact, cautery artifact, tissue folds, crush artifact from forceps, relaxing incision artifact, cartilage dropping out, fat compression, poor staining, dropping of tumor, etc.  These can be introduced as the tumor is \"flattened\". Stain can run from the surgical edge, and stain the surgical margin - giving a false impression that the entire surgical margin is clear, when it is not. While some surgeon unfamiliar with the \"whole piece\" or \"PacMan\"  methods of processing might suggest that multiple piece sectioning is better than one. The more tissue sections are cut, the more artifacts in staining and tissue malformation will be introduced. It is imperative for the surgeon to be fully familiar with tissue handling and processing; and not simply relying on a trained technologist to perform his sectioning.\\n5. Hard to see tumor in heavy inflammatory infiltrate.  This can occur with squamous cell carcinoma, especially when complicated with local infection, or intrinsic lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Because of abnormal peripheral blood profile, response to inflammatory skin conditions with patients with myelomonocytic leukemia can have appearance of atypical cells at sites of inflammation, confusing the Mohs surgeon. \\n6. Perineural spread, and benign changes simulating perineural spread. Tumor spreading along a nerve can be difficult to visualize, and sometime benign plasma cells can surround the nerve, simulating cancer. \\n7. Difficult to cut and process anatomical area.  Examples would be the ear, and other three dimensional structures like eyelids. The ability to make a scallop shaped incision is increasingly difficult when the surgical surface is no longer a flat plane, but is a three dimensional rigid structure.\\n8. Recurrent skin cancer with multiple islands of recurrence. This can occur with either previous excision, or after electrodessication and curettage. As these residual skin cancer are often bound in scar tissue, and present in multiple location in the scar of the previous surgical defect - they are no longer contiguous in nature. Some surgeons advocate the removal of the complete scar in the treatment of \"recurrent\" skin cancers. Others advocate removing only the island of local recurrence, and leaving the previous surgical scar behind. The decision is often made depending on the location of the tumor, and the goal of the patient and physician.\\n9. Unreported or underreported recurrence. Many patients simply will not return to the original surgeon to report a recurrence. Consulting surgeon on the repeat surgery will often not inform the first surgeon of the recurrence. The time it takes for a recurrent tumor to be visible to the patient might be 5 or more years. Quoted \"cure\" rates must be looked upon with the understanding that a 5 year cure rate might not necessary be correct. As basal cell carcinoma is a very slowly progressing tumor, a 5 year no recurrence rate might not be adequate. Longer follow up might be needed to detect a slow growing tumor left in the surgical scar.\\n10. Poor training of the surgeon/pathologist/histotechnologist. While Mohs surgery is essentially a technical method of tissue handling and processing, the skill and training of the surgeon can greatly affect the outcome. The house of card is built with a foundation of good tissue handling, good surgical skill and hemostasis, and the bricks are the tissue processing and staining technique. A surgeon without a good histotechnologist is a house built with straw, and a histotechnologist without a good surgeon can not produce quality slides. While originally, surgeons learned the procedure by spending a few hours to several months with Dr. Mohs;  today, surgeons complete residency and fellowship spending hundreds of hours observing and doing Mohs surgery. It is highly encouraged that a physician interested in learning Mohs surgery should spend extended time observing, cutting, processing, and staining Mohs specimens. The histology block should be correctly mounted and cut the first time, as there is no second chances in Mohs histology. It is not a procedure that can be taught or learn in one weekend. Many residency and Mohs fellowship continue to teach the processing of only 2 Mohs sections per tumor. \\nIrrespective of the problems associated with Mohs surgery, a true cure rate approaching 100% can occur with primary basal cell carcinoma (previously untreated) if proper respect of the physician\\'s limitation, the procedure\\'s limitation, and his laboratory staff\\'s limitation. Conservative approach such as serial sectioning, good staining technique, and conservative Mohs margin (example: tumor at least 200 micrometre from the surgical margin) can assure the lowest recurrence rate.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the symptoms of Molluscum contagiosum?', 'output': 'Typically, the lesion of molluscum begins as a small, painless papule that may become raised up to a pearly, flesh-colored nodule.

Rarely, it can be found as far north as Canada. People catch the infection when their skin comes in contact with soil contaminated with the worms. The tiny worm is barely visible to the naked eye. Young roundworms can move through a person's skin and into the bloodstream to the lungs and airways. They then move up to the throat, where they are swallowed into the stomach. The worms then move to the small intestine, where they attach to the wall. Later, they produce eggs, which hatch into tiny larvae and pass out of the body. Unlike other worms, these larvae can reenter the body through the skin around the anus, which allows an infection to grow. Areas where the worms go through the skin may become red and painful. This infection is uncommon in the United States. Most cases seen in North America are brought by travelers who have visited or lived in South America or Africa.\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Strongyloidiasis ?', 'output': 'Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of strongyloidiasis.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What to expect if I have Strongyloidiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?', 'output': 'With good treatment, people should make a full recovery and the parasites should be removed.

Flea bite exposure may result in primary bubonic plague or septicemic plague.\\nContact with contaminated fluids or tissues\\nHumans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague - infected animal.\\nInfectious droplets\\nWhen a person has plague pneumonia, they may cough droplets containing the plague bacteria into the air. If these bacteria -containing droplets are breathed in by another person, they can cause pneumonic plague. Typically this requires direct and close contact with the person with pneumonic plague. Transmission of these droplets is the only way that plague can spread between people.\\nThis type of spread has not been documented in the United States since 1924, but still occurs with some frequency in developing countries. Cats are particularly susceptible to plague and can be infected by eating infected rodents. Sick cats pose a risk of transmitting infectious plague droplets to their owners or to veterinarians.

Swelling of the hands and feet is often an early feature, with patients noticing a change in ring or shoe size, particularly shoe width. Gradually, bone changes alter the patient’s facial features: The brow and lower jaw protrude, the nasal bone enlarges, and the teeth space out. Overgrowth of bone and cartilage often leads to arthritis. When tissue thickens, it may trap nerves, causing carpal tunnel syndrome, which results in numbness and weakness of the hands.

The pituitary produces several important hormones that control body functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and metabolism. But hormones never seem to act simply and directly. They usually “cascade” or flow in a series, affecting each other’s production or release into the bloodstream. GH is part of a cascade of hormones that, as the name implies, regulates the physical growth of the body. This cascade begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus makes hormones that regulate the pituitary. One of the hormones in the GH series, or “axis,” is growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce GH. Secretion of GH by the pituitary into the bloodstream stimulates the liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is what actually causes tissue growth in the body. High levels of IGF-I, in turn, signal the pituitary to reduce GH production. The hypothalamus makes another hormone called somatostatin, which inhibits GH production and release. Normally, GHRH, somatostatin, GH, and IGF-I levels in the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and blood sugar levels. If the pituitary continues to make GH independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms, the level of IGF-I continues to rise, leading to bone overgrowth and organ enlargement. High levels of IGF-I also cause changes in glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism and can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\\nIn more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called an adenoma, produces excess GH. Pituitary tumors are labeled either micro- or macro-adenomas, depending on their size. Most GH-secreting tumors are macro-adenomas, meaning they are larger than 1 centimeter. Depending on their location, these larger tumors may compress surrounding brain structures. For example, a tumor growing upward may affect the optic chiasm—where the optic nerves cross—leading to visual problems and vision loss. If the tumor grows to the side, it may enter an area of the brain called the cavernous sinus where there are many nerves, potentially damaging them. Compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones. These hormonal shifts can lead to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and erectile dysfunction in men. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the thyroid—another hormone-producing gland—then thyroid hormones may decrease. Too little thyroid hormone can cause weight gain, fatigue, and hair and skin changes. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the adrenal gland, the hormone cortisol may decrease. Too little cortisol can cause weight loss, dizziness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea. Some GH-secreting tumors may also secrete too much of other pituitary hormones. For example, they may produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. Rarely, adenomas may produce thyroid-stimulating hormone. Doctors should assess all pituitary hormones in people with acromegaly. Rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor vary greatly among people with adenomas. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow more rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the venous sinuses, which are located near the pituitary gland. Younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors. Regardless of size, these tumors are always benign. Most pituitary tumors develop spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. They are the result of a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell, which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth, but happens later in life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells. It permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete GH. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.\\nRarely, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain. These tumors also lead to excess GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH, the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. When these non-pituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.\\nIn patients with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Physicians should carefully analyze all “pituitary tumors” removed from patients with acromegaly so they do not overlook the rare possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acromegaly ?', 'output': 'You should talk to your doctor if you experience anything of the symptoms associated with Acromegaly'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What to expect if I have Acromegaly  (Outlook/Prognosis)?', 'output': 'Pituitary surgery is successful in most patients, depending on the size of the tumor and the experience of the surgeon.

Because of salt loss, a craving for salty foods also is common. Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, is more severe in children than in adults. In women, menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Because the symptoms progress slowly, they are usually ignored until a stressful event like an illness or an accident causes them to become worse. This is called an Addisonian crisis, or acute adrenal insufficiency. In most cases, symptoms are severe enough that patients seek medical treatment before a crisis occurs. However, in about 25 percent of patients, symptoms first appear during an addisonian crisis.\\nSymptoms of an addisonian crisis include;\\nSudden penetrating pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs Severe vomiting and diarrhea Dehydration Low blood pressure Loss of consciousness\\nIf left untreated, an addisonian crisis can be fatal.\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': \"What causes Addison's disease?\", 'output': \"Failure to produce adequate levels of cortisol can occur for different reasons. The problem may be due to a disorder of the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency) or to inadequate secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency).\\nAddison's disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people. Most cases are caused by the gradual destruction of the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, by the body's own immune system. About 70 percent of reported cases of Addison's disease are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own tissues or organs and slowly destroy them. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. As a result, often both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldostertone) hormones are lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal gland is affected, as in idiopathic adrenal insufficiency; sometimes other glands also are affected, as in the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome.\\nThe polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into two separate forms, referred to as type I and type II. Type I occurs in children, and adrenal insufficiency may be accompanied by:\\nUnderactive parathyroid glands Slow sexual development Pernicious anemia Chronic Candida infections Chronic active hepatitis Hair loss (in very rare cases)\\nType II, often called Schmidt's syndrome, usually afflicts young adults. Features of type II may include:\\nAn underactive thyroid gland Slow sexual development Diabetes Vitiligo Loss of pigment on areas of the skin\\nScientists think that the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is inherited because frequently more than one family member tends to have one or more endocrine deficiencies.\\nTuberculosis (TB), an infection which can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for about 20 percent of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries. When adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was found at autopsy in 70 to 90 percent of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, however, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands has greatly decreased.\\nLess common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are\\nChronic infection, mainly fungal infections Cancer cells spreading from other parts of the body to the adrenal glands Amyloidosis Surgical removal of the adrenal glands\\nThis form of adrenal insufficiency is much more common than primary adrenal insufficiency and can be traced to a lack of ACTH. Without ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, the adrenal glands' production of cortisol drops, but not aldosterone. A temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been receiving a glucocorticoid hormone such as prednisone for a long time abruptly stops or interrupts taking the medication. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are often used to treat inflammatory illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or ulcerative colitis, block the release of both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Normally, CRH instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH. If CRH levels drop, the pituitary is not stimulated to release ACTH, and the adrenals then fail to secrete sufficient levels of cortisol. Another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the surgical removal of benign, or noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease). In this case, the source of ACTH is suddenly removed, and replacement hormone must be taken until normal ACTH and cortisol production resumes. Less commonly, adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from:\\nTumors or infections of the area Loss of blood flow to the pituitary Radiation for the treatment of pituitary tumors Surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus Surgical removal of the pituitary gland\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Addison%27s disease ?', 'output': \"It is important to seek medical care if you show signs of any of the symptoms associated with Addison's disease.

Wernicke’s aphasia: Damage to the temporal lobe (the side portion) of the brain may result in a fluent aphasia called Wernicke’s aphasia. In most people, the damage occurs in the left temporal lobe, although it can result from damage to the right lobe as well. People with Wernicke’s aphasia may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create made-up words. For example, someone with Wernicke’s aphasia may say, “You know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before.” As a result, it is often difficult to follow what the person is trying to say. People with Wernicke’s aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding speech, and they are often unaware of their mistakes. These individuals usually have no body weakness because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.\\n2. Broca’s aphasia: A type of non-fluent aphasia is Broca’s aphasia. People with Broca’s aphasia have damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. They frequently speak in short phrases that make sense but are produced with great effort. They often omit small words such as “is,” “and,” and “the.” For example, a person with Broca’s aphasia may say, “Walk dog,” meaning, “I will take the dog for a walk,” or “book book two table,” for “There are two books on the table.” People with Broca’s aphasia typically understand the speech of others fairly well. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated. People with Broca’s aphasia often have right-sided weakness or paralysis of the arm and leg because the frontal lobe is also important for motor movements.\\n3.

These influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.\\nHuman infection with avian influenza viruses: There are many different subtypes of type A influenza viruses. Usually, “avian influenza virus ” refers to influenza A viruses found chiefly in birds, but infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk from avian influenza is generally low to most people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans. However, confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza infection have been reported since 1997. Most cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (e.g., domesticated chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion / excretions from infected birds. The spread of avian influenza viruses from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and has been limited, inefficient and unsustained.\\n“Human influenza virus ” usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. There are only three known A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating among humans. Influenza A viruses are constantly changing, and they might adapt over time to infect and spread among humans.\\nDuring an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry, there is a possible risk to people who have contact with infected birds or surfaces that have been contaminated with secretions or excretions from infected birds.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the symptoms of Avian influenza?', 'output': 'Symptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenza - like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other severe and life-threatening complications.

Back pain may occur by itself, or along with other symptoms. Back pain is categorized into acute pain and chronic pain.\\nPain that hits you suddenly—after falling from a ladder, being tackled on the football field, or lifting a load that is too heavy, for example—is acute pain. Acute pain comes on quickly and often leaves just as quickly. To be classified as acute, pain should last no longer than 6 weeks. Acute pain is the most common type of back pain.\\nChronic pain, on the other hand, may come on either quickly or slowly, and it lingers a long time. In general, pain that lasts longer than 3 months is considered chronic. Chronic pain is much less common than acute pain.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What causes Back pain?', 'output': 'Medical problems that can cause back pain include the following:\\nMechanical problems: A mechanical problem is a problem with the way your spine moves or the way you feel when you move your spine in certain ways. Perhaps the most common mechanical cause of back pain is a condition called intervertebral disk degeneration (such as degenerative disk disease), which simply means that the disks located between the vertebrae of the spine are breaking down with age. As they deteriorate, they lose their cushioning ability. This problem can lead to pain if the back is stressed. Other mechanical causes of back pain include spasms, muscle tension, and ruptured disks, which are also called herniated disks.\\nInjuries: Spine injuries such as sprains and fractures can cause either short-lived or chronic pain. Sprains are tears in the ligaments that support the spine, and they can occur from twisting or lifting improperly. Fractured vertebrae are often the result of osteoporosis. Less commonly, back pain may be caused by more severe injuries that result from accidents or falls.\\nAcquired conditions and diseases: Many medical problems can cause or contribute to back pain. They include: Scoliosis, a curvature of the spine that does not usually cause pain until middle age Spondylolisthesis Various forms of arthritis, including: Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis Spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal column that puts pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Kidney stones or kidney infections Endometriosis, which is the buildup of uterine tissue in places outside the uterus. Fibromyalgia, a condition of widespread muscle pain and fatigue.\\nAdditionally, although osteoporosis itself is not painful, it can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae. Pregnancy is also a common cause of back pain.\\nInfections and tumors: Although they are not common causes of back pain, infections can cause pain when they involve the vertebrae, a condition called osteomyelitis, or when they involve the disks that cushion the vertebrae, which is called diskitis. Tumors also are relatively rare causes of back pain.\\nEmotional: Although the causes of back pain are usually physical, emotional stress can play a role in how severe pain is and how long it lasts. Stress can affect the body in many ways, including causing back muscles to become tense and painful.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Who is at highest risk for Back pain ?', 'output': 'Although anyone can have back pain, a number of factors increase your risk. They include:\\nAge: The first attack of low back pain typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 40. Back pain becomes more common with age.\\nFitness level: Back pain is more common among people who are not physically fit. Weak back and abdominal muscles may not properly support the spine. “Weekend warriors”—people who go out and exercise a lot after being inactive all week—are more likely to suffer painful back injuries than people who make moderate physical activity a daily habit. Studies show that low-impact aerobic exercise is good for the disks that cushion the vertebrae, the individual bones that make up the spine.\\nDiet: A diet high in calories and fat, combined with an inactive lifestyle, can lead to obesity, which can put stress on the back.\\nHeredity: Some causes of back pain, such as ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that affects the spine, have a genetic component.\\nRace: Race can be a factor in back problems. African American women, for example, are two to three times more likely than white women to develop spondylolisthesis, a condition in which a vertebra of the lower spine— also called the lumbar spine— slips out of place.\\nThe presence of other diseases: Many diseases can cause or contribute to back pain. These include various forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers elsewhere in the body that may spread to the spine.\\nOccupational risk factors: Having a job that requires heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling, particularly when this involves twisting or vibrating the spine, can lead to injury and back pain. An inactive job or a desk job may also lead to or contribute to pain, especially if you have poor posture or sit all day in an uncomfortable chair.\\nCigarette smoking: Although smoking may not directly cause back pain, it increases your risk of developing low back pain and low back pain with sciatica. For example, smoking may lead to pain by blocking your body’s ability to deliver nutrients to the disks of the lower back. Repeated coughing due to heavy smoking may also cause back pain. It is also possible that smokers are just less physically fit or less healthy than nonsmokers, which increases the likelihood that they will develop back pain. Smoking also increases the risk of osteoporosis, a condition that causes weak, porous bones, which can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae. Furthermore, smoking can slow healing, prolonging pain for people who have had back injuries, back surgery, or broken bones.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Back pain ?', 'output': 'In most cases, it is not necessary to see a doctor for back pain because pain usually goes away with or without treatment.

Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy or treatment with certain anticancer drugs; children seem to be particularly susceptible. A small number of bone cancers are due to heredity. For example, children who have had hereditary retinoblastoma (an uncommon cancer of the eye) are at a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly if they are treated with radiation. Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones and people with metal implants, which doctors sometimes use to repair fractures, are more likely to develop osteosarcoma (4).

A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of developing a disease.\\nAge: The chance of getting breast cancer goes up as a woman gets older. Most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 60. This disease is not common before menopause.\\nPersonal history of breast cancer: A woman who had breast cancer in one breast has an increased risk of getting cancer in her other breast.\\nFamily history: A woman\\'s risk of breast cancer is higher if her mother, sister, or daughter had breast cancer. The risk is higher if her family member got breast cancer before age 40. Having other relatives with breast cancer (in either her mother\\'s or father\\'s family) may also increase a woman\\'s risk.\\nCertain breast changes: Some women have cells in the breast that look abnormal under a microscope. Having certain types of abnormal cells (atypical hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS) increases the risk of breast cancer.\\nGene changes: Changes in certain genes increase the risk of breast cancer. These genes include BRCA1, BRCA2, and others. Tests can sometimes show the presence of specific gene changes in families with many women who have had breast cancer. Health care providers may suggest ways to try to reduce the risk of breast cancer, or to improve the detection of this disease in women who have these changes in their genes. NCI offers publications on gene testing.\\nReproductive and menstrual history: The older a woman is when she has her first child, the greater her chance of breast cancer. Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who went through menopause after age 55 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who never had children are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who take menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin after menopause also appear to have an increased risk of breast cancer.

HPV infection and other risk factors may act together to increase the risk even more:\\nHPV Infection:\\nHPV is a group of viruses that can infect the cervix. An HPV infection that doesn't go away can cause cervical cancer in some women. HPV is the cause of nearly all cervical cancers. These viruses are passed from person to person through sexual contact or skin to skin contact.\\nMost adults have been infected with HPV at some time in their lives, but most infections clear up on their own. Some types of HPV can cause changes to cells in the cervix. If these changes are found early, cervical cancer can be prevented by removing or killing the changed cells before they can become cancer cells. A vaccine for females ages 9 to 26 protects against two types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer.\\nLack of Regular Pap Test:\\nCervical cancer is more common among women who don't have regular Pap test s. The Pap test helps doctors find abnormal cells. Removing or killing abnormal cells usually prevents cervical cancer.\\nSmoking:\\nAmong women who are infected with HPV, smoking cigarettes slightly increases the risk of cervical cancer.\\nWeakened Immune System:\\nInfection with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) or taking drugs that suppress the immune system increases the risk of cervical cancer.\\nSexual History:\\nWomen who have had many sexual partners have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Also, a woman who has had sex with a man who has had many sexual partners may be at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. In both cases, the risk of developing cervical cancer is higher because these women have a higher risk of HPV infection.\\nUsing Birth Control Pills for a Long Time:\\nUsing birth control pills for a long time (5 or more years) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection. However, the risk decreases quickly when women stop using birth control pills.\\nHaving Many Children:\\nStudies suggest that giving birth to many children (5 or more) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection.\\nDES (diethylstilbestrol):\\nDES may increase the risk of a rare form of cervical cancer in daughters exposed to this drug before birth. DES was given to some pregnant women in the United States between about 1940 and 1971. (It is no longer given to pregnant women.)\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cervical cancer ?', 'output': 'You should start getting regular Pap test s at age 21, or within three years of the first time you have sex, which ever happens first. The Pap test is one of the most reliable and effective cancer screening tests available, it also can find other conditions that might need treatment, such as infection or inflammation. In addition to the Pap test; the main test for cervical cancer, the HPV test may be used for screening women aged 30 years and older, or women of any age who have unclear Pap test results. If you are 30 or older, and your screening tests are normal, your chance of getting cervical cancer in the next few years is very low. For that reason, your doctor may tell you that you will not need another screening test for up to three years. But you should still go to the doctor regularly for a check-up that may include a pelvic exam.

You need the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy. However, you may not feel like eating during or soon after treatment. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of treatment (such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, or mouth sores) can make it hard to eat well. Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to cope with these problems. Research shows that people with cancer feel better when they stay active. Walking, yoga, swimming, and other activities can keep you strong and increase your energy. Exercise may reduce nausea and pain and make treatment easier to handle. It also can help relieve stress. Whatever physical activity you choose, be sure to talk to your doctor before you start. You'll need regular checkups after treatment for cervical cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems with checkups, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will check for the return of cancer. Even when cancer seems to have been completely removed or destroyed, the disease sometimes returns because undetected cancer cells remained somewhere in the body after treatment.

Infections (lung abscesses) can form and rupture, releasing pus (empyema) between the lungs and ribs (pleural space). Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is a widespread form of the disease. Infection spreads to other parts of the body, including the skin, brain, bones, and heart. Meningitis occurs in up to half of all people with disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Traveling to an area where the fungus is commonly seen raises your risk for this infection. You are more likely to develop a serious infection if: You are of Native American, African or Philippine descent You have a weakened immune systems due to AIDS, diabetes, or medications that suppress the immune system.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Who is at highest risk for Coccidioidomycosis ?', 'output': 'People with decreased immunity are at increased risks.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Coccidioidomycosis ?', 'output': 'Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of coccidioidomycosis or if your condition does not improve with treatment.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What to expect if I have Coccidioidomycosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?', 'output': 'How well the person does depends on the form of the disease they have and their overall health.

These cells are called cones. They are found in the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. If you are missing just one pigment, you might have trouble telling the difference between red and green. This is the most common type of color blindness. Other times, people have trouble seeing blue-yellow colors. People with blue-yellow color blindness almost always have problems identify reds and greens, too.\\nColor blindness is often inherited genetically. It is most commonly inherited from mutations in a X-linked recessive fashion, but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations – mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and many different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database at Johns Hopkins University).\\nInherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Some of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness are:\\nCone dystrophy Cone-rod dystrophy Achromatopsia (aka rod monochromatism, aka stationary cone dystrophy, aka cone dysfunction syndrome) Blue cone monochromatism Leber's congenital amaurosis Retinitis pigmentosa (initially affects rods but can later progress to cones and therefore color blindness)\\nOther causes of color blindness include:\\nBrain or retinal damage caused by shaken baby syndrome or other accidents and trauma which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe Damage to the retina caused by exposure to ultraviolet light The drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Who is at highest risk for Color blindness ?', 'output': 'Men are at a higher risk for color blindness than women. As color blindness is commonly inherited in a X-linked recessive fashion, about 8 percent of males, but only 0.5 percent of females, are color blind in some way or another, whether it be one color, a color combination, or another mutation.   The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is because males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome being significantly shorter than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one which carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome which carries the mutation. If 5% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 5%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.05 × 0.05 = 0.0025, or just 0.25%.\\nIn addition to those who are genetically predisposed to color blindness, people who suffer from brain or retinal damage, or who take the drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), are at an increased risk of color blindness.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Color blindness ?', 'output': 'Color blindness is not considered a medical emergency.\\nHowever, make an appointment with your optometrist or ophthalmologist if you think you (or your child) have color blindness.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What to expect if I have Color blindness  (Outlook/Prognosis)?', 'output': 'Color blindness is a life-long condition.

Viral conjunctivitis: Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, and/or a sore throat. Its symptoms include watery discharge and variable itch. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other. Viral conjunctivitis is commonly known as \"pink eye.\" Bacterial conjunctivitis: Bacterial conjunctivitis due to the common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, grey or yellowish mucopurulent discharge (mucus, gowl, goop, gunk, eye crust, or other regional names, officially known as\\' gound\\') that may cause the lids to stick together (matting), especially after sleeping. Another symptom that could be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis is severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin.

Many people develop Cushing’s syndrome because they take glucocorticoids—steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisol—such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue. Other people develop Cushing’s syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.\\nThese benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing’s disease, affects women five times more often than men.\\nSome benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women.\\nIn rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes Cushing’s syndrome. Adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. Most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood. Adrenocortical carcinomas—adrenal cancers—are the least common cause of Cushing’s syndrome. With adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.\\nMost cases of Cushing’s syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing’s syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. With primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. With multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; Cushing’s syndrome in MEN1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the symptoms of Cyclothymia?', 'output': 'Episodes of hypomania and mild depression occur for at least 2 years (1 or more years in children and adolescents)\\nMood swings are less severe than in bipolar disorder, major depression, or mania\\nSymptoms are persistent, with no more than 2 symptom-free months in a row'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What causes Cyclothymia?', 'output': 'The causes of cyclothymic disorder are unknown.\\nMajor depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia often occur together in families.

Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times. The drug prevents water excretion, and water can build up now that the kidneys are making less urine and are less responsive to changes in body fluids.\\nNephrogenic DI results when the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH. The kidneys ’ ability to respond to ADH can be impaired by drugs —like lithium, for example—and by chronic disorders including polycystic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, kidney failure, partial blockage of the ureters, and inherited genetic disorders. Sometimes the cause of nephrogenic DI is never discovered. Desmopressin will not work for this form of DI. Instead, a person with nephrogenic DI may be given hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or indomethacin. HCTZ is sometimes combined with another drug called amiloride. The combination of HCTZ and amiloride is sold under the brand name Moduretic. Again, with this combination of drugs, one should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times.\\nDipsogenic DI is caused by a defect in or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in an abnormal increase in thirst and fluid intake that suppresses ADH secretion and increases urine output. Desmopressin or other drugs should not be used to treat dipsogenic DI because they may decrease urine output but not thirst and fluid intake. This fluid overload can lead to water intoxication, a condition that lowers the concentration of sodium in the blood and can seriously damage the brain. Scientists have not yet found an effective treatment for dipsogenic DI.\\nGestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and results when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in the mother. The placenta is the system of blood vessels and other tissue that develops with the fetus. The placenta allows exchange of nutrients and waste products between mother and fetus.Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Who is at highest risk for Diabetes insipidus ?', 'output': 'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus presenting at or shortly after birth can have a genetic cause.

The disease was first noticed in the United States in the early 1900s, around the time processed foods were introduced into the American diet. Consumption of processed foods greatly reduced Americans’ fiber intake.\\nDiverticular disease is common in developed or industrialized countries—particularly the United States, England, and Australia —where low-fiber diets are consumed. The disease is rare in Asia and Africa, where most people eat high-fiber diets.\\nFiber is the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains that the body cannot digest. Some fiber, called soluble fiber, dissolves easily in water. It takes on a soft, jelly-like texture in the intestines. Insoluble fiber passes almost unchanged through the intestines. Both kinds of fiber help prevent constipation by making stools soft and easy to pass.\\nConstipation —or hard stool—may cause people to strain when passing stool during a bowel movement. Straining may cause increased pressure in the colon, which may cause the colon lining to bulge out through weak spots in the colon wall. These bulges are diverticula.\\nLack of exercise also may be associated with a greater risk of forming diverticula, although the reasons for this are not well understood.\\nDoctors are not certain what causes diverticula to become inflamed.

Because most people do not have symptoms, diverticulosis is often found through tests ordered for another ailment. For example, diverticulosis is often found during a colonoscopy done to screen for cancer or polyps or to evaluate complaints of pain or rectal bleeding.\\nWhen taking a medical history, the doctor may ask about bowel habits, pain, other symptoms, diet, and medications. The physical exam usually involves a digital rectal exam. To perform this test, the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to detect tenderness, blockage, or blood. The doctor may check stool for signs of bleeding and test blood for signs of infection. If diverticulitis is suspected, the doctor may order one of the following radiologic tests:\\nAbdominal ultrasound. Sound waves are sent toward the colon through a handheld device that a technician glides over the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the colon and other organs, and their echoes make electrical impulses that create a picture—called a sonogram —on a video monitor. If the diverticula are inflamed, the sound waves will also bounce off of them and show the location. Computerized tomography (CT) scan. The CT scan is a noninvasive x ray that produces cross-section images of the body. The doctor may inject dye into a vein and the person may be given a similar mixture to swallow.

There are two types of dystonia: acquired dystonia and idiopathic dystonia.\\nAcquired dystonia, also called secondary dystonia, results from environmental or disease-related damage to the basal ganglia. Birth injury (particularly due to lack of oxygen), certain infections, reactions to certain drugs, heavy-metal or carbon monoxide poisoning, trauma, or stroke can cause dystonic symptoms. Dystonias can also be symptoms of other diseases, some of which may be hereditary.\\nAbout half the cases of dystonia have no connection to disease or injury and are called primary or idiopathic dystonia. Of the primary dystonias, many cases appear to be inherited in a dominant manner; i.e., only one carrier parent need contribute the dystonia gene for the disease to occur, each child having a 50% chance of being a carrier. In dystonia, however, a carrier may or may not develop a dystonia and the symptoms may vary widely even among members of the same family. The product of one defective gene appears to be sufficient to cause the chemical imbalances that may lead to dystonia; but the possibility exists that another gene or genes and environmental factors may play a role. Researchers have identified more than 15 different genetic mutations that may contribute to dystonia.\\nWhether you have acquired or idiopathic dystonia, researchers think that it is caused by a problem in the part of the brain that handles messages about muscle contractions. Scientists suspect a defect in the body's ability to process a group of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help cells in the brain communicate with each other.\\nThe ultimate goals of research are to find the cause(s) of the dystonias so that they can be prevented, and to find ways to cure and/or more effectively treat people now affected. Scientists at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) laboratories have conducted detailed investigations of the pattern of muscle activity in persons with focal dystonias. One of the most important characteristics is the failure of reciprocal inhibition, a normal process in which muscles with opposite actions work without opposing each other. In dystonia, the tightening of muscles is associated with an abnormal pattern of muscles fighting each other. The search for the gene or genes responsible for some forms of dominantly inherited dystonias continues.\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Who is at highest risk for Dystonia ?', 'output': 'Different dystonias are caused by different factors.

Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable and some are nonmodifiable. Having the risk factor doesn't always mean that you will get the disease but it certainly increases your chances as compared to the general population.\\nRisk factors for lymphoma are as under:\\nAge Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people. Gender Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known. Race, Ethnicity, and Geography In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL. Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world. Family history Having a first degree relative (parent, child, sibling) with NHL increases your risk of developing NHL.\\nExposure to certain chemicals Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress. Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment. Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below). Radiation exposure Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia, and thyroid cancer. Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\\nAutoimmmune diseases Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL. Certain infections Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Helicobacter pylori Chlamydophila psittaci Campylobacter jejuni Hepatitis C Body Weight and Diet Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk.

A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center.

Furthermore, persons who have problems with their immune systems may also develop a chronic anemia with parvovirus B19 infection that requires medical treatment. People who have leukemia or cancer, who are born with immune deficiencies, who have received an organ transplant, or who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at risk for serious illness due to parvovirus B19 infection.

However, before reviewing them, a brief overview of the anatomy of the eye may be helpful in understanding the causes of this disease:\\nThe front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is always being made in the back of the eye. It leaves the eye through channels in the front of the eye in an area called the anterior chamber angle, or simply the angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid out of the eye will cause pressure to build up in the eye. This pressure is called intraocular pressure (IOP). In most cases of glaucoma, this pressure is high and causes damage to the major nerve in the eye, called the optic nerve.\\nMore specific causes by each major type of glaucoma are:\\nOpen-angle (chronic) glaucoma\\nThe cause is unknown. An increase in eye pressure occurs slowly over time. The pressure pushes on the optic nerve and the retina at the back of the eye. Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are at particularly high risk for this disease.\\nAngle-closure (acute) glaucoma\\nIt occurs when the exit of the aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked. Dilating eye drops and certain medications may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.\\nCongenital glaucoma'\\nIt is present at birth and results from the abnormal development of the fluid outflow channels in the eye. It is often hereditary and tends to run in families.\\nSecondary glaucoma\\nIt is caused as complications of other medical conditions and/or procedures, including eye surgery, advanced cataracts, eye injuries, certain eye tumors, and uveitis. It can be caused by drugs such as corticosteroids, which are used to treat eye inflammations. Pigmentary glaucoma is caused when pigment from the iris breaks off, thereby slowing the fluid drainage and blocking the meshwork. Neovascular glaucoma is a severe form of secondary glaucoma that is linked to diabetes.\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Who is at highest risk for Glaucoma ?', 'output': 'Anyone can develop glaucoma, however some people are at higher risk than others.

It may take months or even years for the condition to be detected. Chronic thyroiditis is most common in women and people with a family history of thyroid disease. It affects between 0.1% and 5% of all adults in Western countries. Hashimoto's disease may, in rare cases, be associated with other endocrine disorders caused by the immune system. Hashimoto's disease can occur with adrenal insufficiency and type 1 diabetes. In these cases, the condition is called type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA II).

Eighty-five percent of head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk for developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone.\\nOther risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:\\nOral cavity. Sun exposure (lip); possibly human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salivary glands. Radiation to the head and neck. This exposure can come from diagnostic x-rays or from radiation therapy for noncancerous conditions or cancer. Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Certain industrial exposures, such as wood or nickel dust inhalation. Tobacco and alcohol use may play less of a role in this type of cancer. Nasopharynx. Asian, particularly Chinese, ancestry; Epstein-Barr virus infection; occupational exposure to wood dust; and consumption of certain preservatives or salted foods. Oropharynx.

Cure rates decrease in locally advanced cases, whose probability of cure is inversely related to tumor size and even more so to the extent of regional node involvement.\\nConsensus panels in America (American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC and Europe) have established staging systems for head and neck squamous cancers. These staging systems attempt to standardize clinical trial criteria for research studies, and attempt to define prognostic categories of disease. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are staged according to the TNM classification system, where T is the size and configuration of the tumor, N is the presence or absence of lymph node metastases, and M is the presence or absence of distant metastases. The T, N, and M characteristics are combined to produce a “stage” of the cancer, from I to IVB. \\nEven after successful definitive therapy, head and neck cancer patients face tremendous impacts on quality of life. Despite marked advances in reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and conservation approaches to certain malignancies, some patients continue to have significant functional deficits.\\nSurvival advantages provided by new treatment modalities have been undermined by the significant percentage of patients cured of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who subsequently develop second primary tumors. The incidence of second primary tumors ranges in studies from 9.1%  to 23%  at 20 years. Second primary tumors are the major threat to long-term survival after successful therapy of early-stage HNSCC. Their high incidence results from the same carcinogenic exposure responsible for the initial primary process, called field cancerization.\\nThroat cancer has numerous negative effects on the body systems.\\nAs it can impair a person’s ability to swallow and eat, throat cancer affects the digestive system. The difficulty in swallowing can lead to a person to choke on their food in the early stages of digestion and interfere with the food’s smooth travels down into the esophagus and beyond.\\nThe treatments for throat cancer can also be harmful to the digestive system as well as other body systems. Radiation therapy can lead to nausea and vomiting, which can deprive a body of vital fluids (although these may be obtained through intravenous fluids if necessary). Frequent vomiting can lead to an electrolyte imbalance which has serious consequences for the proper functioning of the heart. Frequent vomiting can also upset the balance of stomach acids which has a negative impact on the digestive system, especially the lining of the stomach and esophagus.\\nIn the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the mouth and behind the nose may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and interfering with the person’s ability to breathe; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to lung cancer. If the respiratory system is unable to bring oxygen into the body, the oxygen deprivation will cause the body's cells to wither and die, causing one to become weaker and sicker.\\nLike any cancer, metastasization affects many areas of the body, as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and organ to organ. For example, if it spreads to the bone marrow, it will prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells and affects the proper functioning of the white blood cells and the body's immune system; spreading to the circulatory system will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer can throw the nervous system into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body.\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the symptoms of HELLP syndrome?', 'output': \"Fatigue or feeling unwell Fluid retention and excess weight gain Headache Nausea and vomiting that continues to get worse Pain in the upper right part of the abdomen Blurry vision Nosebleed or other bleeding that won't stop easily (rare) Seizures or convulsions (rare)\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What causes HELLP syndrome?', 'output': 'A cause for HELLP syndrome has not been found.\\nHELLP syndrome occurs in about 1 to 2 out of 1,000 pregnancies, and in 10-20% of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.\\nMost often HELLP develops before the pregnancy is 37 weeks along.

But in persons with Huntington's disease, it is repeated 36 to 120 times.\\nAs the gene is passed on from one generation to the next, the number of repeats called a CAG repeat expansion tend to get larger. The larger the number of repeats, the greater your chance of developing symptoms at an earlier age. Therefore, as the disease is passed along in families, it becomes evident at younger and younger ages.\\nThere are two forms of Huntington's disease. The most common is adult-onset Huntington's disease. Persons with this form usually develop symptoms in their mid 30s and 40s.\\nAn early-onset form of Huntington's disease accounts for a small number of cases and begins in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms may resemble those of Parkinson's disease with rigidity, slow movements, and tremor.\\nIf one of your parents has Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of getting the gene for the disease.

It is usually done in case the tumor is in chest, abdomen or limbs or bones. It helps to understand whether tumor has damaged the bone or spread to other areas.\\nBiopsy: A biopsy is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of liposarcoma. It could be a needle biopsy or surgical biopsy. In needle biopsy, the doctor usually performs a punch biopsy and removes a tiny round piece of tissue using needle or a small tool. For bigger tissues, an incision may be made and surgical biopsy is used. The sample is sent to a lab where the pathologists can detect the tissues under the microscope and identify the type.\\nComputed tomography CT scan and biopsy: Local CT scans are often used to diagnose soft tissue sarcoma. A CT machine takes multiple images of your body and various organs to check for tumor and extent of spread. A dye may be injected to visualize better and take clearer images. Inform the doctor if there is a prior allergy to the contrast dye. CAT scan confirm the location of the cancer and show the organs nearby. These are helpful for determining the stage of the cancer and in determining whether surgery is a good treatment option. CT scans can also be used to guide biopsy and a biopsy sample is usually removed and looked at under a microscope.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI uses magnetic fields but it is a different type of image than what is produced by computed tomography (CT) and produces detailed images of the body. The magnets and the computer takes multiple pictures of your body with the tumor and helps to visualize the organs, blood vessels, bones, soft tissues and helps in diagnosing accurately. Like computed tomography (CT), a contrast agent may be injected into a patient’s vein to create a better picture. Inform the doctor if you have prior contrast dye allergy. Do not wear metals while undergoing the proceedure as metals can cause injury.\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan: When doing this test, a small amount of a radioactive medium is injected into your body and absorbed by the organs or tissues. This radioactive substance gives off energy which in turn is used to produce the images. PET can provide more helpful information than either CT or MRI scans. It is useful to see if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and it is also useful for your doctor to locate where the cancer has spread.

Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable and some are non modifiable. Having the risk factor doesn't always mean that you will get the disease but it certainly increases your chances as compared to general population.\\nRisk factors for lymphoma are as under:\\nAge Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people. Gender Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known. Race, Ethinicity and Geography In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL. Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world. Family history Having a first degree relative (parent, child, sibling) with NHL increases your risk of developing NHL.\\nExposure to certain chemicals Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress. Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment. Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below). Radiation exposure Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia,and thyroid cancer. Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\\nAutoimmmune diseases Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL. Certain infections Epstein-barr virus (EBV) Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Helicobacter pylori Chlamydophila psittaci Campylobacter jejuni Hepatitis C Body Weight and Diet Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk. Breast implants It is rare, but some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured (rough) surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces).\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the symptoms of Macular degeneration?', 'output': \"At first there may not be any symptoms. However, as the disease progresses, central vision may be affected. It is very important to note that macular degeneration typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision, meaning patients will not have complete vision loss from this disease. Although specific symptoms vary by whether the form is dry or wet, both forms cause no pain.\\nMore detailed symptoms by type include:\\nDry macular degeneration: The most common early sign is blurred vision in the center of the field of vision. As fewer cells in the macula are able to function, people will see details less clearly in front of them. Often objects in the central vision look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. Often this blurred vision will go away in brighter light. A patient may have trouble reading print or seeing other details, but can generally see well enough to walk and perform most routine activities. If the loss of these light-sensing cells becomes great, people may see a small, but growing, blind spot in the middle of their field of vision. In the later stages, patients may not be able to recognize faces until people are close to them. Dry macular degeneration generally affects both eyes, but vision can be lost in one eye while the other eye seems unaffected. Wet macular degeneration: The classic early symptom is that straight lines appear distorted and wavy. This results when fluid from the leaking blood vessels gathers and lifts the macula, distorting vision. A small blind spot may also appear in wet macular degeneration, resulting in loss of one's central vision. Central vision loss can occur very quickly. If this occurs, the patient urgently needs evaluation by an ophthalmologist with experience in retina disease.\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What causes Macular degeneration?', 'output': 'Macular degeneration is caused by damage to the area around blood vessels that supply the macula.

Obesity: Research studies suggest a link between obesity and the progression of early and intermediate stage macular degeneration to advanced macular degeneration. Race: Caucasians are much more likely to lose vision from macular degeneration than African Americans.

These tubes are called semicircular canals, or labyrinths, and, along with a nerve in your skull, help interpret your body's position and maintain your balance. The labyrinth has two parts: the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth, which is encased by bone, is necessary for hearing and balance and is filled with a fluid called endolymph. When your head moves, endolymph moves, causing nerve receptors in the membranous labyrinth to send signals to the brain about the body's motion. An increase in endolymph, however, can cause the membranous labyrinth to balloon or dilate, a condition known as endolymphatic hydrops.\\nMeniere's disease occurs when a part of the canal, called the endolymphatic sac, becomes swollen. This sac helps filter and remove fluid in the semicircular canals.\\nThe exact cause of Meniere's disease is unknown.

Invasion from a primary brain tumor to the meninges - when cancer cells lodge into small arteries causing local ischemia and blood vessel damage leading to spillage of neoplastic cells to the Virchow-Robin spaces thereby providing access to the subarachnoid space. Infiltration to the spinal cord - Cancer cells gain access to the subarachnoid space through this route via the perivascular tissues the surround the blood vessels at the brain entrance. Direct infiltration of the spinal nerve roots (dorsal and ventral) has also been documented.

ER-, PR-positivity in beast cancer increases incidence of neoplastic meningitis. Triple negative breast cancer and the HER2/neu gene positivity displays tropism for CNS metastasis. Among the histologic subtypes of breast cancer, loblular carcinoma demonstrated the highest prevalence for neoplastic meningitis. Brain surgery increases the chance of developing NM. It has been observed after resection of brain tumor (particularly piecemeal resection vs en-block resection) particularly tumors located in the cerebellum. Other cranial surgeries done with involvement of ventricular system manipulation in a patient with known brain metastasis increases the risk. Furthermore, the incidence of neoplastic meningitis seem higher in patient treated with surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery compared with radiosurgery alone. Primary brain cancer always poses a risk for the development of neoplastic meningitis. It is diagnosed in 1-2% of cases of ependymoma, medulloblastoma, germinoma and glioblastoma combined.

Factors affecting the prognosis of patients with neoplastic meningitis includes gene involvement and use of immunotherapy and other targeted therapies. For breast cancer, ER-positivity, lesser extend of initial disease and better performance status has been demonstrated to have better prognosis. For lung cancer, the use of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitors confers durable responses without the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy administration. Lastly, for melanoma, primary tumors located in the trunk has been documented to have a poor prognosis, but intra-CSF administration of chemotherapy significantly improves this prognosis.

Doctors can seldom explain why one person gets pancreatic cancer and another does not. However, it is clear that this disease is not contagious. No one can \"catch\" cancer from another person.\\nResearch has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop pancreatic cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases a person\\'s chance of developing a disease.\\nStudies have found the following risk factors:\\nAge -- The likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age. Most pancreatic cancers occur in people over the age of 60. Smoking -- Cigarette smokers are two or three times more likely than nonsmokers to develop pancreatic cancer. Diabetes -- Pancreatic cancer occurs more often in people who have diabetes than in people who do not. Being male -- More men than women are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Being African American -- African Americans are more likely than Asians, Hispanics, or whites to get pancreatic cancer. Family history -- The risk for developing pancreatic cancer triples if a person\\'s mother, father, sister, or brother had the disease. Also, a family history of colon or ovarian cancer increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis -- Chronic pancreatitis is a painful condition of the pancreas. Some evidence suggests that chronic pancreatitis may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.\\nOther studies suggest that exposure to certain chemicals in the workplace or a diet high in fat may increase the chance of getting pancreatic cancer.\\nMost people with known risk factors do not get pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, many who do get the disease have none of these factors. People who think they may be at risk for pancreatic cancer should discuss this concern with their doctor. The doctor may suggest ways to reduce the risk and can plan an appropriate schedule for checkups.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'How to know you have Pancreatic cancer (Diagnosis)?', 'output': \"If a patient has symptoms that suggest pancreatic cancer, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history. The doctor may perform a number of procedures, including one or more of the following:\\nPhysical exam -- The doctor examines the skin and eyes for signs of jaundice. The doctor then feels the abdomen to check for changes in the area near the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. The doctor also checks for ascites, an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen. Lab tests -- The doctor may take blood, urine, and stool samples to check for bilirubin and other substances. Bilirubin is a substance that passes from the liver to the gallbladder to the intestine. If the common bile duct is blocked by a tumor, the bilirubin cannot pass through normally. Blockage may cause the level of bilirubin in the blood, stool, or urine to become very high. High bilirubin levels can result from cancer or from noncancerous conditions. CT scan (Computed tomography) -- An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures. The x-ray machine is shaped like a donut with a large hole. The patient lies on a bed that passes through the hole. As the bed moves slowly through the hole, the machine takes many x-rays. The computer puts the x-rays together to create pictures of the pancreas and other organs and blood vessels in the abdomen. Ultrasonography -- The ultrasound device uses sound waves that cannot be heard by humans. The sound waves produce a pattern of echoes as they bounce off internal organs. The echoes create a picture of the pancreas and other organs inside the abdomen. The echoes from tumors are different from echoes made by healthy tissues.\\nThe ultrasound procedure may use an external or internal device, or both types: Transabdominal ultrasound: To make images of the pancreas, the doctor places the ultrasound device on the abdomen and slowly moves it around. EUS (Endoscopic ultrasound): The doctor passes a thin, lighted tube (endoscope) through the patient's mouth and stomach, down into the first part of the small intestine. At the tip of the endoscope is an ultrasound device. The doctor slowly withdraws the endoscope from the intestine toward the stomach to make images of the pancreas and surrounding organs and tissues.\\nERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) -- The doctor passes an endoscope through the patient's mouth and stomach, down into the first part of the small intestine. The doctor slips a smaller tube (catheter) through the endoscope into the bile ducts and pancreatic ducts. After injecting dye through the catheter into the ducts, the doctor takes x-ray pictures. The x-rays can show whether the ducts are narrowed or blocked by a tumor or other condition. PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography) -- A dye is injected through a thin needle inserted through the skin into the liver. Unless there is a blockage, the dye should move freely through the bile ducts. The dye makes the bile ducts show up on x-ray pictures. From the pictures, the doctor can tell whether there is a blockage from a tumor or other condition. Biopsy -- In some cases, the doctor may remove tissue. A pathologist then uses a microscope to look for cancer cells in the tissue. The doctor may obtain tissue in several ways. One way is by inserting a needle into the pancreas to remove cells. This is called fine-needle aspiration. The doctor uses x-ray or ultrasound to guide the needle. Sometimes the doctor obtains a sample of tissue during EUS or ERCP. Another way is to open the abdomen during an operation.\"}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pancreatic cancer ?', 'output': 'See your doctor immediately if you feel as though you have experienced any of the above mentioned symptoms.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the symptoms of Panic attack?', 'output': 'Panic attacks involve short periods of intense anxiety symptoms, which peak within 10 minutes.\\nPanic attack symptoms can include:\\nChest pain or discomfort Choking Dizziness or faintness Fear of being out of control Fear of dying Fear of \"going crazy\" Hot flashes or chills Nausea or other stomach distress Numbness or tingling Racing heart (palpitations) Shortness of breath Sweating Trembling'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What causes Panic attack?', 'output': 'Panic attacks often occur in areas or situations where they have happened in the past, panic may be a learned behavior.\\nAgoraphobia sometimes occurs when a person has had a panic attack and begins to fear situations that might lead to another panic attack.\\nAnyone can develop a panic disorder, but it usually starts around age 25.\\nPanic disorder is more common in women than men.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'When to seek urgent medical care when I have Panic attack ?', 'output': 'Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of panic attacks.'}\n","\n","{'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What to expect if I have Panic attack  (Outlook/Prognosis)?', 'output': 'Most patients can get better with medications or behavioral therapy.

Most researchers think that more than one factor could play a role in developing PCOS. Genes are thought to be one factor. Women with PCOS tend to have a mother or sister with PCOS. Researchers also think insulin could be linked to PCOS. Insulin is a hormone that controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body to use or store. For many women with PCOS, their bodies have problems using insulin so that too much insulin is in the body. Excess insulin appears to increase production of androgen. This hormone is made in fat cells, the ovaries, and the adrenal gland. Levels of androgen that are higher than normal can lead to acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and problems with ovulation.\\n<figure-inline class=\"mw-default-size\"> </figure-inline>\\nWhat causes the symptoms of PCOS? The ovaries are two small organs, one on each side of a woman\\'s uterus. A woman\\'s ovaries have follicles, which are tiny sacs filled with liquid that hold the eggs. These sacs also are called cysts. Each month about 20 eggs start to mature, but usually only one matures fully. As this one egg grows, the follicle accumulates fluid in it. When that egg matures, the follicle breaks open to release it. The egg then travels through the fallopian tube for fertilization. When the single egg leaves the follicle, ovulation takes place.\\nIn women with PCOS, the ovary doesn\\'t make all of the hormones it needs for any of the eggs to fully mature. Follicles may start to grow and build up fluid. But no one follicle becomes large enough. Instead, some follicles may remain as cysts. Since no follicle becomes large enough and no egg matures or is released, ovulation does not occur and the hormone progesterone is not made.

Women with PCOS have high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol.\\nThe chance of getting endometrial cancer is another concern for women with PCOS. Irregular menstrual periods and the absence of ovulation cause women to produce the hormone estrogen, but not the hormone progesterone.

Scientists believe that this particular gene on chromosome 22 produces a protein that controls the growth of Schwann cells. When this gene malfunctions, Schwann cell growth is uncontrolled, resulting in a tumor. Scientists also think that this gene may help control the growth of other types of tumors. In neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, the faulty gene on chromosome 22 is inherited. For individuals with unilateral vestibular schwannoma, however, some scientists hypothesize that this gene somehow loses its ability to function properly.\\nThese tumors are thought to occur when there is a defect in a gene that normally prevents tumors from forming.

However, as a general rule, once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it continues to affect the person.\\nAllergy shots are most effective when used to treat those with hay fever symptoms and severe insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction. Allergy shots may require years of treatment, but they work in most cases. However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash) and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis).', 'Symptoms develop rapidly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include the following:\\nAbdominal pain or cramping Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Confusion Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Fainting, light-headedness, dizziness Hives, itchiness Nasal congestion Nausea, vomiting Palpitations Skin redness Slurred speech Wheezing', 'Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person\\'s immune system becomes sensitized to it. On a later exposure to that allergen, an allergic reaction may occur. This reaction happens quickly after the exposure, is severe, and involves the whole body.\\nTissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms.\\nSome drugs (morphine, x-ray dye, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. Aspirin may also cause a reaction. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with \"true\" anaphylaxis. However, the symptoms, risk for complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions.\\nAnaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include:\\nDrug allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings\\nPollens and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause.\\nAnaphylaxis is life-threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction.', 'Call 911 if you develop severe symptoms of anaphylaxis. If you are with another person, he or she may take you to the nearest emergency room.', 'Anaphylaxis is a severe disorder that can be life-threatening without prompt treatment. However, symptoms usually get better with the right therapy, so it is important to act right away.', 'The main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface. You may also develop welts or swelling on the surface of your skin. The swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out. The welts are painful and may be itchy. They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful.\\nOther symptoms may include:\\nAbdominal cramping. Breathing difficulty. Swollen eyes and mouth. Swollen lining of the eyes (chemosis).', 'Angioedema may be caused by an allergic reaction. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an allergen.\\nIn many cases, the cause of angioedema is never found. The following may cause angioedema:\\nAnimal dander (scales of shed skin). Exposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat. Foods (such as berries, shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and others). Insect bites. Medications (drug allergy), such as antibiotics (penicillin and sulfa drugs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors). Pollen.\\nHives and angioedema may also occur after infections or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as lupus, and leukemia and lymphoma). A form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema, and it is not discussed in this
