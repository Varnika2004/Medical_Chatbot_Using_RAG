0,What are the symptoms of Allergy?,"Allergy symptoms vary, but may include:
Breathing problems (coughing, shortness of breath) Burning, tearing, or itchy eyes Conjunctivitis (red, swollen eyes) Coughing Diarrhea Headache Hives Itching of the nose, mouth, throat, skin, or any other area Runny nose Skin rashes Stomach cramps Vomiting Wheezing
What part of the body is contacted by the allergen plays a role in the symptoms you develop. For example:
Allergens that are breathed in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus production, cough, or wheezing. Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Eating something you are allergic to can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, or a severe, life-threatening reaction. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or even skin peeling. Drug allergies usually involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms."
1,What causes Allergy?,"The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens, which are generally harmless and in most people do not cause a problem.But in a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, it releases chemicals such as histamines. which fight off the allergen. This causes itching, swelling, mucus production, muscle spasms, hives, rashes, and other symptoms, which vary from person to person.
Common allergens include pollen, mold, pet dander, and dust. Food and drug allergies are common. Allergic reactions can also be caused by insect bites, jewelry, cosmetics, spices, and other substances.Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers.
Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.A specific allergy is not usually passed down through families (inherited). However, if both your parents have allergies, you are likely to have allergies. The chance is greater if your mother has allergies.
Allergies may make certain medical conditions such as sinus problems, eczema, and asthma worse.Allergies are relatively common. Both genetics and environmental factors play a role."
2,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Allergy ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
Severe symptoms of allergy occur. Treatment for allergies no longer works."
3,What to expect if I have Allergy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most allergies can be easily treated with medication. Some children may outgrow an allergy. This is particularly true of food allergies. However, as a general rule, once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it continues to affect the person.
Allergy shots are most effective when used to treat those with hay fever symptoms and severe insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction. Allergy shots may require years of treatment, but they work in most cases. However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash) and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis)."
4,What are the symptoms of Anaphylaxis?,"Symptoms develop rapidly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include the following:
Abdominal pain or cramping Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Confusion Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Fainting, light-headedness, dizziness Hives, itchiness Nasal congestion Nausea, vomiting Palpitations Skin redness Slurred speech Wheezing"
5,What causes Anaphylaxis?,"Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. On a later exposure to that allergen, an allergic reaction may occur. This reaction happens quickly after the exposure, is severe, and involves the whole body.
Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms.
Some drugs (morphine, x-ray dye, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. Aspirin may also cause a reaction. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with ""true"" anaphylaxis. However, the symptoms, risk for complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions.
Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include:
Drug allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings
Pollens and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause.
Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction."
6,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anaphylaxis ?,"Call 911 if you develop severe symptoms of anaphylaxis. If you are with another person, he or she may take you to the nearest emergency room."
7,What to expect if I have Anaphylaxis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Anaphylaxis is a severe disorder that can be life-threatening without prompt treatment. However, symptoms usually get better with the right therapy, so it is important to act right away."
8,What are the symptoms of Angioedema?,"The main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface. You may also develop welts or swelling on the surface of your skin. The swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out. The welts are painful and may be itchy. They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful.
Other symptoms may include:
Abdominal cramping. Breathing difficulty. Swollen eyes and mouth. Swollen lining of the eyes (chemosis)."
9,What causes Angioedema?,"Angioedema may be caused by an allergic reaction. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an allergen.
In many cases, the cause of angioedema is never found. The following may cause angioedema:
Animal dander (scales of shed skin). Exposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat. Foods (such as berries, shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and others). Insect bites. Medications (drug allergy), such as antibiotics (penicillin and sulfa drugs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors). Pollen.
Hives and angioedema may also occur after infections or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as lupus, and leukemia and lymphoma). A form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema, and it is not discussed in this article."
10,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Angioedema ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Angioedema does not respond to treatment It is severe You have never had angioedema before
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have:
Abnormal breathing sounds (stridor) Difficulty breathing Fainting Wheezing"
11,What to expect if I have Angioedema  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Angioedema that does not affect the breathing may be uncomfortable, but is usually harmless and goes away in a few days."
12,What are the symptoms of Asthma?,"Most people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Either wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom.
Asthma attacks can last for minutes to days, and can become dangerous if the airflow is severely restricted.
Cough with or without sputum (phlegm) production Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing (intercostal retractions) Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise or activity Wheezing: Comes in episodes with symptom-free periods in between May be worse at night or in early morning May go away on its own Gets better when using drugs that open the airways (bronchodilators) Gets worse when breathing in cold air Gets worse with exercise Gets worse with heartburn (reflux) Usually begins suddenly
Bluish color to the lips and face Decreased level of alertness such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack Extreme difficulty breathing Rapid pulse Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath Sweating
Abnormal breathing pattern (breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in) Breathing temporarily stops Chest pain Nasal flaring Tightness in the chest"
13,What causes Asthma?,"Asthma is caused by inflammation in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the muscles surrounding the airways become tight and the lining of the air passages swells. This reduces the amount of air that can pass by.
In sensitive individuals, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in allergy-causing substances (called allergens or triggers).
Common asthma triggers include:
Animals (pet hair or dander) Dust Changes in weather (most often cold weather) Chemicals in the air or in food Exercise Mold Pollen Respiratory infections, such as the common cold Strong emotions (stress) Tobacco smoke
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provoke asthma in some patients."
14,Who is at highest risk for Asthma ?,"Many people with asthma have an individual or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies."
15,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Asthma ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if asthma symptoms develop. Call your health care provider or go to the emergency room if:
An asthma attack requires more medication than recommended Symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment You have shortness of breath while talking Your peak flow measurement is 50-80% of your personal best
Go to the emergency room if:
Drowsiness or confusion develops There is severe shortness of breath at rest The peak flow measurement is less than 50% of your personal best You have severe chest pain"
16,What to expect if I have Asthma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"There is no cure for asthma, although symptoms sometimes improve over time. With proper self management and medical treatment, most people with asthma can lead normal lives."
17,What are the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis?,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is usually extremely itchy. The bumps or blisters usually appear on the elbows, knees, back, and buttocks. In most cases, the rash is the same size and shape on both sides. Symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis tend to come and go."
18,What causes dermatitis herpetiformis?,"The cause is unknown. However, dermatitis herpetiformis is frequently linked to gluten sensitivity (celiac sprue disease) in the small bowel."
19,Who is at highest risk for Dermatitis herpetiformis ?,"Dermatitis herpetiformis occurs in both men and women, usually of age 20 years and older. Although children may be sometimes affected."
20,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dermatitis herpetiformis ?,Call your health care provider if the rash is non- resolving despite of the treatment.
21,What to expect if I have Dermatitis herpetiformis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is an autoimmune disorder which is strongly associated with celiac disease, which also affects the small intestine. The rash can be controlled with gluten free diet and an inability to adhere to the diet increase the risk of intestinal cancer."
22,What are the symptoms of Drug allergy?,"Anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reaction (see below). Hives. Itching of the skin or eyes (common). Skin rash (common). Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face. Wheezing.
Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:
Abdominal pain or cramping. Confusion. Diarrhea. Difficulty breathing with wheeze or hoarse voice. Dizziness. Fainting, lightheadedness. Hives over different parts of the body. Nausea, vomiting. Rapid pulse. Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations)."
23,What causes Drug allergy?,"Adverse reactions to drugs are common, and almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.
A true drug allergy results from a series of chemical steps within the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.
It can develop two different ways:
The first time you take the medicine, you have no problems, but your body's immune system produces a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE, but this is not well understood.
Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after exposure to a medication or vaccine.
Penicillin and related antibiotics are the most common cause of drug allergies. Other common allergy-causing drugs include:
Sulfa drugs. Anticonvulsants. Insulin preparations (particularly animal sources of insulin). Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like anaphylactoid reactions).
Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered ""idiosyncratic."" This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication, not due to a predictable chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy, which can be life threatening."
24,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Drug allergy ?,"Call your health care provider if you are taking a medication and seem to be having a reaction to it.
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions."
25,What to expect if I have Drug allergy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most drug allergies respond readily to treatment. A few cases cause severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death."
26,What are the symptoms of Food allergy?,"Symptoms usually begin immediately, within 2 hours after eating. Rarely, the symptoms may begin hours after eating the offending food.
If you develop symptoms shortly after eating a specific food, you may have a food allergy. Key symptoms include hives, hoarse voice, and wheezing.
Other symptoms that may occur include:
Abdominal pain. Diarrhea. Difficulty swallowing. Itching of the mouth, throat, eyes, skin, or any area. Lightheadedness or fainting. Nasal congestion. Nausea. Runny nose. Patches of itchy, scaly skin (atopic dermatitis); skin may peel or blister. Swelling (angioedema), especially of the eyelids, face, lips, and tongue. Shortness of breath. Stomach cramps. Vomiting.
Symptoms of mouth (oral) allergy syndrome:
Itchy lips, tongue, and throat. Swollen lips (sometimes)."
27,What causes Food allergy?,"Normally, your body's immune system defends against potentially harmful substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. In some people, an immune response is triggered by a substance that is generally harmless, such as a specific food.
The cause of food allergies is related to your body making a type of allergy-producing substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to a particular food.
Although many people have a food intolerance, food allergies are less common. In a true food allergy, the immune system produces antibodies and histamine in response to the specific food.
Any food can cause an allergic reaction, but a few foods are the main culprits. In children, the most common food allergies are to:
Eggs. Milk. Peanuts. Shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster). Soy. Tree nuts. Wheat.
A food allergy frequently starts in childhood, but it can begin at any age. Fortunately, many children will outgrow their allergy to milk, egg, wheat, and soy by the time they are 5 years old if they avoid the offending foods when they are young. Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish tend to be lifelong.
In older children and adults, the most common food allergies are:
Fish. Peanuts. Shellfish. Tree nuts.
Food additives -- such as dyes, thickeners, and preservatives – may rarely cause an allergic or intolerance reaction.
An allergy syndrome that affects the mouth and tongue may occur after eating certain fresh fruits and vegetables. These foods contain substances similar to certain pollens. For example, melon contains substances similar to ragweed pollen, and apples have allergens similar to tree pollen.
Many Americans believe they have food allergies, while in reality fewer than 1% have true allergies. Most symptoms are caused by intolerances to foods such as:
Corn products. Cow's milk and dairy products. Wheat and other gluten-containing grains."
28,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Food allergy ?,"Call your local emergency number, such as 911, if you have any serious or whole-body reactions (particularly wheezing or difficulty breathing) after eating a food. If your doctor prescribed epinephrine for severe reactions, inject it as soon as possible, even before calling 911. The sooner you inject the epinephrine, the better. Anyone who has had an allergic reaction to a food should be evaluated by an allergy specialist."
29,What to expect if I have Food allergy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Avoiding the offending foods may be easy if the food is uncommon or easily identified. However, you may need to severely restrict your diet, carefully read all package ingredients, and ask detailed questions when eating away from home."
30,What are the symptoms of Hay fever?,"Symptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include:
Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Tearing eyes
Symptoms that may develop later include:
Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Memory problems and slowed thinking"
31,What causes Hay fever?,"An allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen or dust, the body releases chemicals, including histamine. This causes allergy symptoms such as itching, swelling, and mucus production.
Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen. (A similar reaction occurs with allergy to mold, animal dander, dust, and similar inhaled allergens.)
The pollens that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from region to region. Large, visible pollens are seldom responsible for hay fever. Tiny, hard to see pollens more often cause hay fever. Examples of plants commonly responsible for hay fever include:
Trees (deciduous and evergreen) Grasses Ragweed
The amount of pollen in the air can play a role in whether hay fever symptoms develop. Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have increased amounts of pollen in the air than cool, damp, rainy days when most pollen is washed to the ground.
Some disorders may be associated with allergies. These include eczema and asthma.
Allergies are common. Your genes and environment may make you more prone to allergies."
32,Who is at highest risk for Hay fever?,"Whether or not you are likely to develop allergies is often passed down through families. If both your parents have allergies, you are likely to have allergies. The chance is greater if your mother has allergies."
33,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hay fever ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if severe symptoms of allergies or hay fever occur, if previously successful treatment has become ineffective, or if your symptoms do not respond to treatment."
34,What to expect if I have Hay fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated. More severe cases require allergy shots.
Some people (particularly children) may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the allergen. However, as a general rule, once a substance causes allergies for an individual, it can continue to affect the person over the long term."
35,What are the symptoms of Hypersensitivity pneumonitis?,"Symptoms of acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis may occur 4 - 6 hours after you have left the area where the foreign substance is found, making it difficult to find a connection between your activity and the disease.
Symptoms may include:
Chills. Cough. Fever. Malaise (feeling ill). Shortness of breath.
Symptoms of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may include:
Breathlessness, especially with activity. Cough, often dry. Loss of appetite. Unintentional weight loss."
36,What causes Hypersensitivity pneumonitis?,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually occurs in people who work in places where there are high levels of organic dusts, fungus, or molds. Bird fancier's lung is the most common type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It is caused by repeated or intense exposure to proteins found in the feathers or droppings of many species of birds.
Farmer's lung is caused by exposure to dust from moldy hay, straw, and grain. These exposures can lead to lung inflammation and acute lung disease. Over time, this acute Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may turn into long-lasting (chronic) lung disease.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be caused by fungi or bacteria in humidifiers, heating systems, and air Hypersensitivity pneumonitisers found in homes and offices. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as isocyanates or acid anhydrides, can also lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis."
37,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypersensitivity pneumonitis ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
38,What to expect if I have Hypersensitivity pneumonitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most symptoms go away when you avoid or limit your exposure to the material that caused the problem.
39,How is the Skin allergy testing done?,"There are many methods of allergy testing. Among the more common are:
Skin tests. Elimination-type tests. Blood tests (including the radioallergosorbent, or RAST, test).
SKIN TESTS
Skin tests are the most common. Specific methods vary.
One of the most common methods is the prick test. This test involves placing a small amount of suspectedallergy-causing substances on the skin, usually the forearm, upper arm, or the back. Then, the skin is pricked so the allergen goes under the skin's surface. The health care provider closely watches the skin for signs of a reaction, usually swelling and redness of the site. Results are usually seen within 15-20 minutes. Several allergens can be tested at the same time.
A similar method involves injecting a small amount of allergen into the skin and watching for a reaction at the site. This is called an intradermal skin test. It is more likely to be used when testing is being done to find out if you are allergy to something specific, such as bee venom or penicillin.
Patch testing is a method to diagnose allergic reactions on the skin. Possible allergens are taped to the skin for 48 hours. The health care provider will look at the area in 24 hours, and then again 48 hours later.
Skin tests are most useful for diagnosing:
Food allergy. Mold, pollen, animal, and other allergies that cause allergic rhinitis and asthma. Penicillin allergy. Venom allergy. Allergic contact dermatitis.
ELIMINATION TESTS
An elimination diet can be used to check for food allergies. An elimination diet is one in which foods that may be causing symptoms are removed from the diet for several weeks and then slowly re-introduced one at a time while the person is watched for signs of an allergic reaction.
BLOOD TESTS
Blood tests can be done to measure the amount of immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies to a specific allergen in the blood. This test may be used when skin testing is not helpful or cannot be done
Other blood tests include:
Absolute eosinophil count. Total IgE level.
PROVOCATION
Provocation (challenge) testing involves exposing a person to a suspected allergen under controlled circumstances. This may be done in the diet or by breathing in the suspected allergen. This type of test may provoke severe allergic reactions. Challenge testing should only be done by a doctor.
Another method is the double-blind test. This method involves giving foods and harmless substances in a disguised form. The person being tested and the provider are both unaware of whether the substance tested in that session is the harmless substance or the suspected food. A third party knows the identity of the substances and identifies them with some sort of code. This test requires several sessions if more than one substance is under investigation.
While the double-blind strategy is useful and practical for mild allergic reactions, it must be done carefully in individuals with suspected severe reactions to foods. Blood tests may be a safer first approach.
Skin tests may cause very mild discomfort when the skin is pricked. Itching may occur if you have a positive reaction to the allergen."
40,Who needs Skin allergy testing?,"Allergy tests are done to determine the specific substances that cause an allergic reaction in a person.
Your doctor may order allergy tests if you have:
Allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms that are not easily controlled with medications. Angioedema and hives. Food allergies. Contact dermatitis. Penicillin allergy.
NOTE: Allergies to penicillin and closely related medications are the only drug allergies that can be tested using skin tests. Skin tests for allergies to other drugs can be dangerous.
The prick skin test may also be used to diagnose food allergies. Intradermal tests are not used to test for food allergies because of high false positive results and the danger of causing a severe allergic reaction."
41,Where to find centers that perform Skin allergy testing?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Skin allergy testing
42,What to expect if I have Skin allergy testing  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Normal Results
In a nonallergic person, allergy tests should be negative (no response to the allergen).
Abnormal Results
A positive result means you reacted to a specific substance. Often, but not always, a positive result means the symptoms that you are having are due to exposure to the substance in question. In general, a stronger response means you are more sensitive to the substance.
People can have a positive response with allergy skin testing, but not have any problems with the specific substance in every day life.
The skin tests are generally reliable. However, if the dose of allergen is excessive, a positive reaction will occur even in persons who are not allergic."
43,What are the symptoms of Urticaria ?,"Itching Swelling of the surface of the skin into red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges.
The hives may get bigger, spread, and join together to form larger areas of flat, raised skin.
They can also change shape, disappear, and reappear within minutes or hours. A true hive comes and goes. When you press the center of one, it turns white. This is called blanching."
44,What are the causes of Urticaria ?,"When you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into your bloodstream. This causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms. Hives are a common reaction, especially in people with other allergies such as hay fever.
When swelling or welts occur around the face, especially the lips and eyes, it is called angioedema. Swelling from angioedema can also occur around your hands, feet, and throat.
Many substances can trigger hives, including:
Animal dander (especially cats) Insect bites Medications Pollen Shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and other foods
Hives may also develop as a result of:
Emotional stress Extreme cold or sun exposure Excessive perspiration Illness (including lupus, other autoimmune diseases, and leukemia Infections such as mononucleosis"
45,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Urticaria ?,"Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have:
Fainting Shortness of breath Tightness in your throat Tongue or face swelling Wheezing
Call your health care provider if the hives are severe, uncomfortable, and do not respond to self-care measures."
46,What to expect if I have Urticaria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hives may be uncomfortable, but they generally are harmless and disappear on their own. In most cases, the exact cause of hives cannot be identified."
47,What are the symptoms of Malignant hyperthermia?,"Bleeding Dark brown urine Muscle ache without an obvious cause, such as exercise or injury Muscle rigidity and stiffness Quick rise in body temperature to 105 degrees F or higher"
48,Who is at highest risk for Malignant hyperthermia ?,"Malignant hyperthermia is inherited. Only one parent has to carry the disease for a child to inherit the condition.
It may occur with muscle diseases such as multiminicore myopathy and central core disease."
49,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Malignant hyperthermia ?,"Tell both the surgeon and anesthesiologist before having any surgery if:
You know that you or a member of your family has had problems with general anesthesia You know you have a family history of malignant hyperthermia"
50,What to expect if I have Malignant hyperthermia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Repeated episodes or untreated episodes can cause kidney failure. Untreated episodes can be fatal.
51,How is Pain Treated?,"The goal of pain management is to improve function, enabling individuals to work, attend school, or participate in other day-to-day activities. Patients and their physicians have a number of options for the treatment of pain; some are more effective than others. Sometimes, relaxation and the use of imagery as a distraction provide relief. These methods can be powerful and effective, according to those who advocate their use. Whatever the treatment regime, it is important to remember that pain is treatable. The following treatments are among the most common.
Acetaminophen is the basic ingredient found in Tylenol® and its many generic equivalents. It is sold over the counter, in a prescription-strength preparation, and in combination with codeine (also by prescription).
Acupuncture dates back 2,500 years and involves the application of needles to precise points on the body. It is part of a general category of healing called traditional Chinese or Oriental medicine. Acupuncture remains controversial but is quite popular and may one day prove to be useful for a variety of conditions as it continues to be explored by practitioners, patients, and investigators.
Analgesic refers to the class of drugs that includes most painkillers, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. The word analgesic is derived from ancient Greek and means to reduce or stop pain. Nonprescription or over-the-counter pain relievers are generally used for mild to moderate pain. Prescription pain relievers, sold through a pharmacy under the direction of a physician, are used for more moderate to severe pain.
Anticonvulsants are used for the treatment of seizure disorders but are also sometimes prescribed for the treatment of pain. Carbamazepine in particular is used to treat a number of painful conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia. Another antiepileptic drug, gabapentin, is being studied for its pain-relieving properties, especially as a treatment for neuropathic pain.
Antidepressants are sometimes used for the treatment of pain and, along with neuroleptics and lithium, belong to a category of drugs called psychotropic drugs. In addition, anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines also act as muscle relaxants and are sometimes used as pain relievers. Physicians usually try to treat the condition with analgesics before prescribing these drugs.
Antimigraine drugs include the triptans- sumatriptan (Imitrex®), naratriptan (Amerge®), and zolmitriptan (Zomig®)-and are used specifically for migraine headaches. They can have serious side effects in some people and therefore, as with all prescription medicines, should be used only under a doctor's care.
Aspirin may be the most widely used pain-relief agent and has been sold over the counter since 1905 as a treatment for fever, headache, and muscle soreness.
Biofeedback is used for the treatment of many common pain problems, most notably headache and back pain. Using a special electronic machine, the patient is trained to become aware of, to follow, and to gain control over certain bodily functions, including muscle tension, heart rate, and skin temperature. The individual can then learn to effect a change in his or her responses to pain, for example, by using relaxation techniques. Biofeedback is often used in combination with other treatment methods, generally without side effects. Similarly, the use of relaxation techniques in the treatment of pain can increase the patient's feeling of well-being.
Capsaicin is a chemical found in chili peppers that is also a primary ingredient in pain-relieving creams (see Chili Peppers, Capsaicin, and Pain in the Appendix).
Chemonucleolysis is a treatment in which an enzyme, chymopapain, is injected directly into a herniated lumbar disc (see Spine Basics in the Appendix) in an effort to dissolve material around the disc, thus reducing pressure and pain. The procedure's use is extremely limited, in part because some patients may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to chymopapain.
Chiropractic care may ease back pain, neck pain, headaches, and musculoskeletal conditions. It involves ""hands-on"" therapy designed to adjust the relationship between the body's structure (mainly the spine) and its functioning. Chiropractic spinal manipulation includes the adjustment and manipulation of the joints and adjacent tissues. Such care may also involve therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy involves a wide variety of coping skills and relaxation methods to help prepare for and cope with pain. It is used for postoperative pain, cancer pain, and the pain of childbirth.
Counseling can give a patient suffering from pain much needed support, whether it is derived from family, group, or individual counseling. Support groups can provide an important adjunct to drug or surgical treatment. Psychological treatment can also help patients learn about the physiological changes produced by pain.
COX-2 inhibitors may be effective for individuals with arthritis. For many years scientists have wanted to develop a drug that works as well as morphine but without its negative side effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by blocking two enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, both of which promote production of hormones called prostaglandins, which in turn cause inflammation, fever, and pain. The newer COX-2 inhibitors primarily block cyclooxygenase-2 and are less likely to have the gastrointestinal side effects sometimes produced by NSAIDs.
In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved a COX-2 inhibitor-celecoxib-for use in cases of chronic pain. The long-term effects of all COX-2 inhibitors are still being evaluated, especially in light of new information suggesting that these drugs may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Patients taking any of the COX-2 inhibitors should review their drug treatment with their doctors.
Electrical stimulation, including transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), implanted electric nerve stimulation, and deep brain or spinal cord stimulation, is the modern-day extension of age-old practices in which the nerves of muscles are subjected to a variety of stimuli, including heat or massage. Electrical stimulation, no matter what form, involves a major surgical procedure and is not for everyone, nor is it 100 percent effective. The following techniques each require specialized equipment and personnel trained in the specific procedure being used:
TENS uses tiny electrical pulses, delivered through the skin to nerve fibers, to cause changes in muscles, such as numbness or contractions. This in turn produces temporary pain relief. There is also evidence that TENS can activate subsets of peripheral nerve fibers that can block pain transmission at the spinal cord level, in much the same way that shaking your hand can reduce pain. Peripheral nerve stimulation uses electrodes placed surgically on a carefully selected area of the body. The patient is then able to deliver an electrical current as needed to the affected area, using an antenna and transmitter. Spinal cord stimulation uses electrodes surgically inserted within the epidural space of the spinal cord. The patient is able to deliver a pulse of electricity to the spinal cord using a small box-like receiver and an antenna taped to the skin. Deep brain or intracerebral stimulation is considered an extreme treatment and involves surgical stimulation of the brain, usually the thalamus. It is used for a limited number of conditions, including severe pain, central pain syndrome, cancer pain, phantom limb pain, and other neuropathic pains.
Exercise has come to be a prescribed part of some doctors' treatment regimes for patients with pain. Because there is a known link between many types of chronic pain and tense, weak muscles, exercise-even light to moderate exercise such as walking or swimming-can contribute to an overall sense of well-being by improving blood and oxygen flow to muscles. Just as we know that stress contributes to pain, we also know that exercise, sleep, and relaxation can all help reduce stress, thereby helping to alleviate pain. Exercise has been proven to help many people with low back pain. It is important, however, that patients carefully follow the routine laid out by their physicians.
Hypnosis, first approved for medical use by the American Medical Association in 1958, continues to grow in popularity, especially as an adjunct to pain medication. In general, hypnosis is used to control physical function or response, that is, the amount of pain an individual can withstand. How hypnosis works is not fully understood. Some believe that hypnosis delivers the patient into a trance-like state, while others feel that the individual is simply better able to concentrate and relax or is more responsive to suggestion. Hypnosis may result in relief of pain by acting on chemicals in the nervous system, slowing impulses. Whether and how hypnosis works involves greater insight-and research-into the mechanisms underlying human consciousness.
Ibuprofen is a member of the aspirin family of analgesics, the so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see below). It is sold over the counter and also comes in prescription-strength preparations.
Low-power lasers have been used occasionally by some physical therapists as a treatment for pain, but like many other treatments, this method is not without controversy.
Magnets are increasingly popular with athletes who swear by their effectiveness for the control of sports-related pain and other painful conditions. Usually worn as a collar or wristwatch, the use of magnets as a treatment dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. While it is often dismissed as quackery and pseudoscience by skeptics, proponents offer the theory that magnets may effect changes in cells or body chemistry, thus producing pain relief.
Narcotics (see Opioids, below).
Nerve blocks employ the use of drugs, chemical agents, or surgical techniques to interrupt the relay of pain messages between specific areas of the body and the brain. There are many different names for the procedure, depending on the technique or agent used. Types of surgical nerve blocks include neurectomy; spinal dorsal, cranial, and trigeminal rhizotomy; and sympathectomy, also called sympathetic blockade (see Nerve Blocks in the Appendix).
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including aspirin and ibuprofen) are widely prescribed and sometimes called non-narcotic or non-opioid analgesics. They work by reducing inflammatory responses in tissues. Many of these drugs irritate the stomach and for that reason are usually taken with food. Although acetaminophen may have some anti-inflammatory effects, it is generally distinguished from the traditional NSAIDs.
Opioids are derived from the poppy plant and are among the oldest drugs known to humankind. They include codeine and perhaps the most well-known narcotic of all, morphine. Morphine can be administered in a variety of forms, including a pump for patient self-administration. Opioids have a narcotic effect, that is, they induce sedation as well as pain relief, and some patients may become physically dependent upon them. For these reasons, patients given opioids should be monitored carefully; in some cases stimulants may be prescribed to counteract the sedative side effects. In addition to drowsiness, other common side effects include constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
Physical therapy and rehabilitation date back to the ancient practice of using physical techniques and methods, such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation, in the treatment of certain conditions. These may be applied to increase function, control pain, and speed the patient toward full recovery.
Placebos offer some individuals pain relief although whether and how they have an effect is mysterious and somewhat controversial. Placebos are inactive substances, such as sugar pills, or harmless procedures, such as saline injections or sham surgeries, generally used in clinical studies as control factors to help determine the efficacy of active treatments. Although placebos have no direct effect on the underlying causes of pain, evidence from clinical studies suggests that many pain conditions such as migraine headache, back pain, post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis, angina, and depression sometimes respond well to them. This positive response is known as the placebo effect, which is defined as the observable or measurable change that can occur in patients after administration of a placebo. Some experts believe the effect is psychological and that placebos work because the patients believe or expect them to work. Others say placebos relieve pain by stimulating the brain's own analgesics and setting the body's self-healing forces in motion. A third theory suggests that the act of taking placebos relieves stress and anxiety-which are known to aggravate some painful conditions-and, thus, cause the patients to feel better. Still, placebos are considered controversial because by definition they are inactive and have no actual curative value.
R.I.C.E. - Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation - are four components prescribed by many orthopedists, coaches, trainers, nurses, and other professionals for temporary muscle or joint conditions, such as sprains or strains. While many common orthopedic problems can be controlled with these four simple steps, especially when combined with over-the-counter pain relievers, more serious conditions may require surgery or physical therapy, including exercise, joint movement or manipulation, and stimulation of muscles.
Surgery, although not always an option, may be required to relieve pain, especially pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. Surgery may take the form of a nerve block (see Nerve Blocks in the Appendix) or it may involve an operation to relieve pain from a ruptured disc. Surgical procedures for back problems include discectomy or, when microsurgical techniques are used, microdiscectomy, in which the entire disc is removed; laminectomy, a procedure in which a surgeon removes only a disc fragment, gaining access by entering through the arched portion of a vertebra; and spinal fusion, a procedure where the entire disc is removed and replaced with a bone graft. In a spinal fusion, the two vertebrae are then fused together. Although the operation can cause the spine to stiffen, resulting in lost flexibility, the procedure serves one critical purpose: protection of the spinal cord. Other operations for pain include rhizotomy, in which a nerve close to the spinal cord is cut, and cordotomy, where bundles of nerves within the spinal cord are severed. Cordotomy is generally used only for the pain of terminal cancer that does not respond to other therapies. Another operation for pain is the dorsal root entry zone operation, or DREZ, in which spinal neurons corresponding to the patient's pain are destroyed surgically. Because surgery can result in scar tissue formation that may cause additional problems, patients are well advised to seek a second opinion before proceeding. Occasionally, surgery is carried out with electrodes that selectively damage neurons in a targeted area of the brain. These procedures rarely result in long-term pain relief, but both physician and patient may decide that the surgical procedure will be effective enough that it justifies the expense and risk. In some cases, the results of an operation are remarkable. For example, many individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia who are not responsive to drug treatment have had great success with a procedure called microvascular decompression, in which tiny blood vessels are surgically separated from surrounding nerves."
52,What are the symptoms of Abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"Aneurysms develop slowly over many years and often have no symptoms. If an aneurysm expands rapidly, tears open (ruptured aneurysm), or blood leaks along the wall of the vessel (aortic dissection), symptoms may develop suddenly. As the aneurysm grows, some symptoms may be:
Pulsating feeling near the navel Pain in the abdomen or back -- severe, sudden, persistent, or constant. The pain may radiate to the groin, buttocks, or legs. Clammy skin Nausea and vomiting Shock Rapid heart rate"
53,What causes Abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"The exact cause is unknown, but risk factors for developing an aortic aneurysm include:
Smoking High blood pressure High cholesterol Male gender Emphysema Genetic factors Obesity"
54,Who is at highest risk for Abdominal aortic aneurysm ?,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm can develop in anyone, but is most often seen in males over 60 who have one or more risk factors. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to rupture and break open."
55,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Abdominal aortic aneurysm ?,Go to the emergency room or call 911 if you have pain in your belly or back that does not go away or is very bad.
56,What to expect if I have Abdominal aortic aneurysm  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually good if an experienced surgeon repairs the aneurysm before it ruptures. However, less than 40% of patients survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm."
57,What are the symptoms of Acute aortic syndrome?,"The symptoms usually begin suddenly, and include severe chest pain. The pain may feel like a heart attack, and can:
Be described as sharp, stabbing, tearing, or ripping Be felt below the chest bone, then move under the shoulder blades or to the back Move to the shoulder, neck, arm, jaw, abdomen, or hips Change position -- pain typically moves to the arms and legs as the acute aortic syndrome gets worse
Symptoms are caused by a decrease of blood flowing to the rest of the body, and can include:
Anxiety and a feeling of doom Fainting or dizziness Heavy sweating (clammy skin) Nausea and vomiting Pale skin (pallor) Rapid, weak pulse Shortness of breath -- trouble breathing when lying flat (orthopnea)
Other symptoms may include:
Pain in the abdomen Stroke symptoms Swallowing difficulties from pressure on the esophagus"
58,What causes Acute aortic syndrome?,"When it leaves the heart, the aorta first moves up through the chest toward the head (the ascending aorta). It then bends or arches, and finally moves down through the chest and abdomen (the descending aorta). Acute aortic syndrome most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This usually occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal part.
When a tear occurs, it creates two channels:
One in which blood continues to travel Another where blood stays still
If the channel with nontraveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta. This can narrow the other branches and reduce blood flow through them. An Acute aortic syndrome may also cause abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta (aneurysm)."
59,Who is at highest risk for Acute aortic syndrome ?,"Aging Atherosclerosis Blunt trauma to the chest, such as hitting the steering wheel of a car during an accident High blood pressure
Other risk factors and conditions associated with the development of acute aortic syndrome include:
Bicuspid aortic valve Coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta Connective tissue disorders Heart surgery or procedures Marfan syndrome and rare genetic disorders Pregnancy Swelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis
Acute aortic syndrome occurs in about 2 out of every 10,000 people. It can affect anyone but is most often seen in men ages 40 to 70."
60,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute aortic syndrome ?,"If you have symptoms of acute aortic syndrome or severe chest pain, call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the emergency room as quickly as possible."
61,What to expect if I have Acute aortic syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acute aortic syndrome is life-threatening. The condition can be managed with surgery if it is done before the aorta ruptures. Less than half of patients with a ruptured aorta survive.
Those who survive will need lifelong, aggressive treatment of high blood pressure. They will need to be followed up with CT scans every few months to monitor the aorta."
62,What are the symptoms of Alstrom syndrome?,"Blindness or severe vision impairment in infancy Dark patches of skin (acanthosis nigricans) Deafness Impaired heart function (cardiomyopathy), which may lead to heart failure Obesity Progressive kidney failure Slowed growth Symptoms of childhood-onset or type 2 diabetes
Occasionally, the following can also occur:
Gastrointestinal reflux Hypothyroidism Liver dysfunction Small penis"
63,What causes Alstrom syndrome?,Alström syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means both your parents must pass on a copy of the defective gene (ALMS1) in order for you to have this disease. It is unknown how the defective gene causes the disorder. The condition is extremely rare. It is more common in Holland and Sweden than in the United States.
64,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alstrom syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you or your child have symptoms of diabetes such as increased thirst and urination. Seek medical attention promptly if you think that your child cannot see or hear normally.
65,What to expect if I have Alstrom syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The following are likely to develop:
Deafness Permanent blindness Type 2 diabetes Kidney and liver failure may get worse."
66,What are the symptoms of Amyloidosis?,"Symptoms depend on the organs affected by the deposits. These organs can include the tongue, intestines, skeletal and smooth muscles, nerves, skin, ligaments, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Symptoms include:
Abnormal heart rhythm (arrythmia) Enlarged tongue Fatigue Numbness of hands and feet Shortness of breath Skin changes Swallowing problems Swelling in the arms and legs Weak hand grip Weight loss
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Decreased urine output Diarrhea Hoarseness or changing voice Joint pain Weakness"
67,What causes Amyloidosis?,"The cause of primary amyloidosis is unknown. The condition is related to abnormal and excess production of antibodies by a type of immune cell called plasma cells.
Primary amyloidosis can lead to conditions that include:
Carpal tunnel syndrome Heart muscle damage (cardiomyopathy) leading to congestive heart failure Intestinal malabsorption Liver enlargement Kidney failure Nephrotic syndrome Neuropathy (nerves that do not work properly) Orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure with standing)
The deposits build up in the affected organs, causing them to become stiff, which decreases their ability to function."
68,Who is at highest risk for Amyloidosis ?,"Risk factors have not been identified. Primary amyloidosis is rare. It is similar to multiple myeloma, and is treated the same way."
69,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Amyloidosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of primary amyloidosis. You know you have primary amyloidosis and you have difficulty breathing, persistent swelling of the ankles or other areas, decreased urine output, or other symptoms that may indicate complications have developed."
70,What to expect if I have Amyloidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How severe the disease is depends on the organs that are affected. When the heart and kidney are involved, it may lead to organ failure and death. Body-wide (systemic) involvement can lead to death in 1 to 3 years."
71,What are the symptoms of Aneurysm ?,"The symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm. If the aneurysm occurs near the body's surface, pain and swelling with a throbbing mass is often seen.
Aneurysms within the body or brain often cause no symptoms.
If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. The risk of death after a rupture is high."
72,What causes Aneurysm ?,"It is not clear exactly what causes aneurysms. Some aneurysms are present at birth (congenital). Defects in some of the parts of the artery wall may be responsible. Common locations for aneurysms include:
The major artery from the heart (the aorta) The brain (cerebral aneurysm) In the leg behind the knee popliteal artery aneurysm) Intestine (mesenteric artery aneurysm) An artery in the spleen (splenic artery aneurysm)
High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cigarette smoking may raise your risk of certain types of aneurysms. High blood pressure is thought to play a role in abdominal aortic aneurysms. Atherosclerotic disease (cholesterol buildup in arteries) may also lead to the formation of some aneurysms.
Pregnancy is often linked to the formation and rupture of splenic artery aneurysms."
73,When to Contact a Medical Professional ?,"Call your health care provider for if you develop a lump on your body, whether or not it is painful and throbbing."
74,What to expect if I have Aneurysm  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With successful surgical repair, the outlook is often excellent."
75,What are symptoms of Angina?,"Angina itself is the most important syptom of coronary artery disease. It is the signal of myocardial ischemia. There are other symptoms accopanying with angina as following,
Chest pain: It always focus on precordial region or behind sternum. Not all chest pain is related to coronary artery disease. Feeling of chest pressure: Some people feel chest pressure just like a huge stone on your chest or like a rope stringing your chest. Feeling of indigestion: Loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting may occur in part patient. Pain in shoulders,arms,jaw or back: It is always accompanying with chest pain or discomfort.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
76,Who is at highest risk for Angina ?,"Studies have found a number of factors that may induce angina. The risk factors of coronary artery disease are as the same as Angina. It concludes bad lifestyle and cardiovascular diseases risk factors. Some you can change and some you can not change.
Risk factors you can change
Cigarette smoking: Cigarette somking has a close relationship with many cardiovascular diseases. Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is 2–4 times than that of nonsmokers. Besides, it is also a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease; smokers have about twice the risk of nonsmokers. Furthermore, cigarette smoking acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the hazard for coronary heart disease. People who smoke seem to have a higher risk of death from coronary heart diseases (and possibly stroke) but these risk isn't as great as cigarette nonsmokers'. High blood cholesterol: As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. A person's cholesterol level is greatly affected by diet. Stress: Clinical researches demonstrate that stress may be a contributing factor for coronary artery disease. People under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. These behavior may increase the risk of incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Weight: Overweight and fat, especially body mass index (BMI) higher than 28 are risk factor for angina. Controlling weight is an available way to decrease the incident of angina. High blood pressure: Patients with Hypertension seem to have a higher risk to develope coronary artery disease. This is because that Hypertension decrease the reserve of coronary arteries. Diabetes mellitus: Like hypertension, patients with diabetes mellitus seem to have a higher risk to develope coronary artery disease. Because diabetes mellitus damage both coronary arteries and myocardial capillary vessels. Drinking too much alcohol: Data has demonstrated too much alcohol damage your arteries and myocardium.
Risk factors that you cannot change
Age: People being older than 65 years or more have more probobility to develope to coronary artery disease than younger. Gender: Male is an independent risk factor to develope to coronary artery disease than female. Post-menopause women also have greater probobility than younger women. Heredity: Person with a family history of cardiovascular diseases is more likely to develope to coronary artery disease than people without family history. Race: African Americans are at a higher risk than other races."
77,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Angina ?,"People with cardiovascular diseases family history or bad life-style should go to the doctor to follow-up. When one has the following symptoms, he/she need to seek urgent medical care:
Persistent and severe chest pain Sudden drop in blood pressure Shortness of breath Angina or chest pain accompanying with sweating or nausea or discomfort in shoulders, arms, jaws, neck or abdomen
These symptoms suggest that the person need to go to hospital to verify whether there are acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or not."
78,What are symptoms of angina pectoris?,"Angina itself is the most important syptom of coronary artery disease. It is the signal of myocardial ischemia. There are other symptoms accopanying with angina as following,

These symptoms suggest that the person need to go to hospital to verify whether there are acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or not."
81,What are the symptoms of Antithrombin III deficiency?,"Patients will usually have symptoms of a blood clot, including:
Coughing up blood Fainting Shortness of breath and pain when taking deep breaths Swelling of one leg"
82,What causes Antithrombin III deficiency?,"Antithrombin III is a protein in the blood that naturally blocks blood clots from forming. Congenital antithrombin III deficiency is an inherited disease. It occurs when a person receives one abnormal copy of a gene from a parent with the disease.
The abnormal gene leads to low levels of antithrombin III. These low levels of antithrombin III can cause abnormal blood clots (thrombi) that may damage organs.
Often, patients with this condition will have a blood clot at a young age and will have a family member who has also experienced a blood clotting episode. In people with this condition, a blood clot may occur without the common risk factors of pregnancy, lack of movement (due to surgery or trauma), or use of oral birth control pills."
83,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Antithrombin III deficiency ?,See your health care provider if you have symptoms of this condition.
84,What to expect if I have Antithrombin III deficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most patients have a good outcome if they stay on anticoagulant medications.
85,What are symptoms of Aortic coarctation?,"The signs and symptoms of coarctation of the aorta depend on how much blood can flow through the artery. Children with serious aortic narrowing tend to show signs and symptoms earlier in life, while mild cases may not be diagnosed until adulthood. Usual symptoms include
Pale skin Dizziness or fainting Shortness of breath Headache Chest pain Nosebleed Hypertension Muscle weakness Leg cramps or cold feet Poor growth
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
86,What are causes Aortic coarctation?,"The aorta carries blood from the heart to the vessels that supply the body with blood and nutrients. If part of the aorta is narrowed, it is hard for blood to pass through the artery. Aortic coarctation is more common in persons with certain genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome. However, it can also be due to birth defects of the aortic valves. Aortic coarctation is one of the more common heart conditions that are present at birth (congenital heart conditions). It is usually diagnosed in children or adults under age 40.
Coarctation of the aorta may be seen with other congenital heart defects, such as:
Bicuspid aortic valve Defects in which only one ventricle is present Ventricular septal defect"
87,Who is at highest risk for Aortic coarctation ?,"Like many congenital heart disease, the cause of aortic coarctation is not clear. Clinical studies suggest that genetic and environmental factors both play an important role during pregnancy. These include:
Genetic disorders such as Turner syndrome Viral infections during pregnancy"
88,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Aortic coarctation ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has aortic coarctation and symptoms do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms appear. If your baby experiences either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Sudden shortness of breath Severe chest pain Fainting Unexplained hypertension"
89,What to expect if I have Aortic coarctation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of aortic coarctation depends on whether balloon angioplasty and stenting or the surgery has been done or not.
90,What are the symptoms of Aortic dissection?,"The symptoms usually begin suddenly, and include severe chest pain. The pain may feel like a heart attack, and can:
Be described as sharp, stabbing, tearing, or ripping Be felt below the chest bone, then move under the shoulder blades or to the back Move to the shoulder, neck, arm, jaw, abdomen, or hips Change position -- pain typically moves to the arms and legs as the aortic dissection gets worse
Symptoms are caused by a decrease of blood flowing to the rest of the body, and can include:
Anxiety and a feeling of doom Fainting or dizziness Heavy sweating (clammy skin) Nausea and vomiting Pale skin (pallor) Rapid, weak pulse Shortness of breath -- trouble breathing when lying flat (orthopnea)

93,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Aortic dissection ?,"If you have symptoms of aortic dissection or severe chest pain, call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the emergency room as quickly as possible."
94,What to expect if I have Aortic dissection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Aortic dissection is life-threatening. The condition can be managed with surgery if it is done before the aorta ruptures. Less than half of patients with a ruptured aorta survive.
Those who survive will need lifelong, aggressive treatment of high blood pressure. They will need to be followed up with CT scans every few months to monitor the aorta."
95,What are the symptoms of Aortic insufficiency?,"Aortic insufficiency often has no symptoms for many years. Symptoms may occur slowly or suddenly and include the following:
Bounding pulse Chest pain, angina type (rare) Under the chest bone; pain may move to other areas of the body, most often the left side of the chest Crushing, squeezing, pressure, tightness Pain increases with exercise, and goes away with rest Fainting Fatigue, excessive tiredness Irregular, rapid, racing, pounding, or fluttering pulse Palpitations (sensation of the heart beating) Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down Swelling of the feet, legs, or abdomen Weakness, more often with activity"
96,What causes Aortic insufficiency?,"Aortic insufficiency can result from any condition that keeps the aortic valve from closing all the way. A small amount of blood comes back each time the heart beats.
The condition causes widening (dilation) of the left lower chamber of the heart. Larger amounts of blood leave the heart with each squeeze or contraction. This leads to a strong and forceful pulse (bounding pulse). Over time, the heart becomes less able to pump blood to the body.
In the past, rheumatic fever was the main cause of aortic insufficiency. Now that antibiotics are used to treat rheumatic fever, other causes are more commonly seen.
Causes of aortic insufficiency may include:
Ankylosing spondylitis Aortic dissection Congenital (present at birth) valve problems Endocarditis High blood pressure Marfan syndrome Reiter syndrome Syphilis Systemic lupus erythematosus"
97,Who is at highest risk for Aortic insufficiency ?,"Aortic insufficiency affects approximately 5 out of every 10,000 people. It is most common in men between the ages of 30 and 60."
98,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Aortic insufficiency ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of aortic insufficiency. You have aortic insufficiency and symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, especially chest pain, difficulty breathing, or edema (swelling)."
99,What to expect if I have Aortic insufficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Aortic insufficiency is curable with surgical repair. This can completely relieve symptoms unless severe heart failure is present or other complications develop. Without treatment, patients with angina or congestive heart failure do poorly."
100,What are the symptoms of aortic stenosis?,"You may have no symptoms at all until late in the course of the disease. The diagnosis may have been made when your healthcare provider heard a heart murmur and then performed additional tests.
Breathlessness with activity. Chest pain, which resembles what is known as angina -type pain. The pain is crushing, squeezing, pressure or tightness in nature. The pain increases with exercise, relieved with rest. The patient feels pain under the chest bone, it may move to other areas. Fainting, weakness, or dizziness with activity. Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations).
Becoming tired or fatigued with exertion more easily than others (in mild cases) Serious breathing problems that develop within days or weeks of birth (in severe cases) Extremely tired Sweaty Pale skin Fast breathing They may also be smaller than other children their age
Children with mild or moderate aortic stenosis may get worse as the get older. They also run the risk of developing an infection of the heart valves (bacterial endocarditis)."
101,What causes aortic stenosis?,"In the United States, aortic stenosis often results from calcium deposits on the aortic valve. These deposits occur naturally with age and have no relationship with the amount of calcium in the diet. Approximately 2% of all people have a bicuspid aortic valve, which increases the risk of these calcifications and makes them more likely to develop aortic stenosis. Worldwide, aortic stenosis occurs most commonly in those who've had rheumatic fever, a condition that may develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is increasingly rare in the United States.
Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), or it may develop later in life (acquired). Children with aortic stenosis may have other congenital conditions. Radiation treatment to the chest, and some medications may cause aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is not common. It occurs more often in men than in women.
As the aortic valve becomes more narrow, the pressure increases inside the lower chamber of the heart (the left ventricle). This causes the left ventricle to become thicker, decreasing blood flow and can lead to chest pain. As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs, and you may feel short of breath. Severe forms of aortic stenosis prevent enough blood from reaching the brain and rest of the body. This can cause lightheadedness and fainting."
102,Who is at highest risk for Aortic stenosis ?,"Aortic stenosis occurs more often in men than in women. The calcifications that cause most cases of aortic stenosis are more likely to occur in patients above the age of 50, who are overweight, who smoke, and who have diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These are the same risk factors for atherosclerosis of the coronary blood vessels.
People who had rheumatic fever as a child also have a somewhat higher risk of developing aortic stenosis, but rheumatic fever is very rare in the United States. Radiation therapy for treatment of cancer, such as breast cancer or lymphoma, may also increase the risk of aortic stenosis."
103,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Aortic stenosis ?,"Call your health care provider if you or your child have symptoms of aortic stenosis. For example, call if you or your child have increasing shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting.
Also contact your doctor if you have been diagnosed with this condition and your symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop."
104,What to expect if I have Aortic stenosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with mild aortic stenosis may do very well using a watchful waiting approach with their health care provider. They may be treated medically for some conditions associated with aortic stenosis, such as high blood pressure, and may have a normal life expectancy.
Those with more severe symptoms, such as chest pain or signs of heart failure like shortness of breath and leg swelling, generally do poorly without surgery. However, surgery does have the potential to cure a person's aortic stenosis. The success of surgery depends on a number of factors, including patient age, overall activity level, and presence of other medical conditions. As with any operation, aortic valve surgery has some risks, most of which occur during the first 1-2 days after surgery. These include an irregular heart rhythm and blood clots in the legs. There is also a chance that the new or repaired valve may stop working which might require another surgery."
105,What Causes An Aortic Valve To Malfunction?,"The aortic valve to malfunction for several reasons. For example, the aortic valve may be abnormal from birth (congenital aortic valve disease), or it could become diseased with age (acquired aortic valve disease).
The most common congenital abnormality is a bicuspid aortic valve. As shown below, the aortic valve normally has three leaflets, but a bicuspid aortic valve has only two. It may, therefore, not open or close completely.
A bicuspid aortic valve is a common abnormality and occurs in 1-2% of people. This is the second most common cause of aortic valve disease requiring surgery. Such valves may function normally for years before becoming stenotic, regurgitant, or both. People with a bicuspid aortic valve require antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures but generally no other special precautions are required other than regular follow up with a qualified cardiologist.
The most common cause of aortic valve disease requiring surgery is called ""senile aortic calcification,"" meaning that the valve has worn out with age. When a valve becomes worn, the body deposits calcium on it for reasons that are unknown. The calcium restricts or limits the motion of the valve leaflets. This may prevent the valve from opening (causing stenosis) or closing (causing leakage or regurgitation). Less common causes of aortic valve disease include diseases of the aorta, the main blood vessel coming out of the heart and carrying blood to the rest of the body, including ascending aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, and Marfan's syndrome."
106,Are There Any Warning Signs For A Failing Aortic Valve?,"A failing aortic valve may cause a variety of symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain (angina pectoris), and dizziness or loss of consciousness (passing out).
A narrow valve makes the heart work harder just to pump the blood through the valve to the body. A leaky valve lets blood back into the heart after it has been pumped out. The heart must therefore pump more blood forward to make up for the blood that is leaking backwards. Either way the extra work may cause symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath. Early on the shortness of breath may be noticeable only with exercise. Later, with the progression of valve disease, a patient could experience shortness of breath with even light activity or at rest. Some patients will be unable to sleep flat in bed or may awaken from sleep short of breath. Another sign of heart failure that may occasionally occur is swelling of your feet, particularly prominent later in the afternoon or evening although other conditions, such as varicose veins, can also cause this to occur.
The extra work the heart has to perform may also cause chest pain or angina pectoris similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. It may be difficult to tell the difference between heart valve disease and narrowing of the blood vessels to the heart itself (coronary arteries).
Aortic valve disease may also cause dizziness, light headedness or even fainting spells."
107,How Does Someone Know If They Should Have Surgery To Repair An Aortic Valve?,"The decision to proceed with surgery should be made with your medical care team which usually consists of a thoracic or cardiothoracic surgeon and a cardiologist. Your medical team will likely base their recommendations on your symptoms and on the results of several tests including an echocardiogram and sometimes cardiac catheterization. An echocardiogram may show enlargement of the heart, and can help to measure the degree of stenosis or regurgitation. A cardiac catheterization provides similar information, but can also identify any narrowings of the coronary arteries."
108,What Options Exist For The Replacement Of Artificial Valves?,"Unlike the mitral valve which can often be repaired, the aortic valve usually requires replacement. Once the decision is made to proceed with surgery, choices regarding the type of artificial valve (prosthesis) used should be considered. In broad terms there are two types of artificial valves or prostheses: mechanical valves and biological valves. Examples of the valves that your cardiothoracic surgeon might use are pictured below."
109,Are There Differences Between Mechanical And Biological Replacement Valves?,"A number of excellent mechanical replacement valves or prostheses are available today. Most surgeons have a particular preference for one valve over another related to technical factors (how they are sewn into place), however from the patient's point of view there is little if any difference between valves. The principle advantage of mechanical valves is their excellent durability. From a practical standpoint, they do not wear out. The principle disadvantage is that there is a tendency for blood to clot on all mechanical valves. Therefore patients with artificial valves must take anticoagulants or ""blood thinners"" for the rest of their life. There is also a small but definite risk of blood clots causing stroke.
There are a variety of natural or biological valves that can be used to replace an abnormal valve. They all share a reduced risk of blood clots forming but all are less durable than mechanical valves. Given enough time, they will probably all wear out. The options in this category include ""xenograft"" valves made from animal tissues (most often pig aortic valves), ""homograft"" or ""allograft"" valves retrieved from human cadavers, and ""pulmonary autograft"" valves moved from the patient's pulmonary artery on the right side of the heart to the aortic position on the left.
The decision on the type of valve used should be made in conjunction with your cardiothoracic surgeon and your cardiologist. Ultimately the choice will depend on a patient's preferences, lifestyle, and individual risks as determined by age and other medical conditions."
110,Why Is Surgery Necessary?,"The aortic valve is the outflow valve of the left side of the heart, meaning that it opens during systole (when the ventricle contracts or squeezes blood out into the aorta and the rest of the body). When the aortic valve is too narrow or stenotic, the ventricle has to work harder to pump the blood out to the body. This extra work consumes significant energy and ultimately requires extra blood flow to the heart itself. If there is not enough blood flow, the heart becomes ischemic causing anginal chest pain. Aortic stenosis is often progressive, growing worse with time. As the valve gets tighter, the heart has to continue to work harder and harder to keep pumping blood out of the heart. At some point the heart can no longer compensate, resulting in episodes of low blood pressure or hypotension or even syncope. As the heart fails to compensate, fluid will build up in the lungs creating congestion.
When the aortic valve leaks, the heart has to work harder and similar problem occur. The ventricle must pump more blood with each contraction to produce the same forward output, creating a condition called volume overload. The heart can compensate for this volume overload for many months or years provided the leakage develops slowly. Eventually, the heart begins to fail producing shortness of breath and fatigue."
111,What Are The Risks Of Surgery?,"Individual risks of surgery can be best estimated by your cardiothoracic surgeon and cardiologist. Risks generally depend on age, general health, specific medical conditions, and heart function."
112,What Will My Condition Be Like After Aortic Valve Replacement?,"After successful aortic valve replacement, patients can expect to return to their preoperative condition or better. Anticoagulation (""blood thinners"") with a drug like Coumadin may be prescribed for 6 weeks to 3 months after surgery for those with biological valves, and for life for those with mechanical valves. Once the wounds have healed, most patients should experience few if any restrictions to activity. A patient will require preventative or prophylactic antibiotics whenever having dental work, and should always tell a doctor about their valve surgery before any surgical procedure.

113,How is Aortic valve surgery (minimally invasive) done?,"Before your surgery you will receive general anesthesia. This will make you fall into a pain-free sleep.
There are several different ways to do minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. Techniques include laparoscopy or endoscopy, robot-assisted surgery, and percutaneous surgery.
Your surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided. This allows the surgeon to reach your heart and aortic valve. For the endoscopic, or keyhole, approach, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to do the surgery. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about 1/2 to 3/4 inches) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the heart and aortic valve on the computer. This method is very precise.
You will need to be on a heart-lung machine for all of these surgeries.
If your aortic valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:
Mechanical: Made of man-made materials, such as titanium or ceramic. These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological: made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.
In some cases, you will have coronary artery bypass surgery, or surgery to replace the first part of the aorta (large blood vessel leaving the heart) at the same time.
Once the new valve is working, your surgeon will:
Close the small cut to your heart or aorta Place catheters (flexible tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up Close the surgical cut in your muscles and skin
The surgery may take 3 to 6 hours.
Aortic valve surgery can also be done through a groin artery. No cuts are made on your chest. The doctor sends a catheter (tube) with a balloon attached on the end to the valve. The balloon stretches the opening of the valve. This procedure is called percutaneous valvuloplasty."
114,Who needs Aortic valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"Aortic valve surgery is done when the valve does not work properly. Surgery may be done for these reasons:
Changes in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fainting spells (syncope), or heart failure. Tests show that changes in your aortic valve are beginning to seriously harm how well your heart works. Your heart valve has been damaged by endocarditis (infection of the heart valve).
A minimally invasive procedure has many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk of infection. You will also recover faster than you would from open heart surgery.
Percutaneous valvuloplasty is only done in patients who are too sick for major heart surgery. The results of percutaneous valvuloplasty are not long-lasting."

116,What are the risks of Aortic valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"Risks for any surgery are:
Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs. Blood loss. Breathing problems. Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves. Reactions to medicines.
Minimally invasive surgery techniques have far fewer risks than open surgery. Possible risks from minimally invasive valve surgery are:
Damage to other organs, nerves, or bones. Heart attack, stroke, or death. Infection of the new valve. Irregular heartbeat that must be treated with medicines or a pacemaker. Kidney failure. Poor healing of the wounds."
117,What to expect before Aortic valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"Always tell your doctor or nurse:
If you are or could be pregnant What drugs you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.
You may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your surgeon about how you and your family members can donate blood.
For the 2-week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery.
Some of them are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix), talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.
Prepare your house for when you get home from the hospital.
The day before your surgery. Shower and shampoo well. You may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest two or three times with this soap. You also may be asked to take an antibiotic to guard against infection.
During the days before your surgery:
Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your doctor for help. Always let your doctor know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your surgery.
On the day of the surgery:
You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes chewing gum and using breath mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry, but be careful not to swallow. Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital."
118,What to expect after Aortic valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"After your operation, you will spend 3 to 7 days in the hospital. You will spend the first night in an intensive care unit (ICU). Nurses will monitor your condition constantly.
Usually within 24 hours, you will be moved to a regular room or a transitional care unit in the hospital. You will slowly resume some activity. You may begin a program to make your heart and body stronger.
You may have two to three tubes in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart. These are usually removed 1 to 3 days after surgery.
You may have a catheter (flexible tube) in your bladder to drain urine. You may also have intravenous (IV, in the vein) lines for fluids. Nurses will closely watch monitors that display information about your vital signs (pulse, temperature, and breathing). You will have daily blood tests and EKGs to test your heart function until you are well enough to go home.
A temporary pacemaker may be placed in your heart if your heart rhythm becomes too slow after surgery.
Once you are home, recovery takes time. Take it easy, and be patient with yourself."
119,How is Aortic valve surgery (open) done?,"Before your surgery you will receive general anesthesia. This will make you unconscious and unable to feel pain.
Your surgeon will make a 10-inch-long cut in the middle of your chest. Next, your surgeon will separate your breastbone to be able to see your heart and aorta (the main blood vessel leading from your heart to the rest of your body). Most people are connected to a heart-lung bypass machine or bypass pump. Your heart is stopped while you are connected to this machine. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped.
If your aortic valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:
Mechanical: Made of man-made materials, such as titanium or ceramic.

These valves last 10 to 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.
Once the new valve is working, your surgeon will:
Close your heart and take you off the heart-lung machine. Place catheters (tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up. Close your breastbone with stainless steel wires. It will take about 6 weeks for the bone to heal. The wires will stay inside your body.
This surgery may take 2 to 5 hours.
Sometimes other procedures are done during open aortic surgery. These include:
Coronary bypass surgery Graft of the first part of the aorta (large blood vessel leaving the heart) Ross (or switch) procedure"
120,Who needs Aortic valve surgery (open)?,"You may need surgery if your aortic valve does not work properly. You may need open-heart valve surgery for these reasons:
Changes in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fainting spells (syncope), or heart failure. Tests show that changes in your aortic valve are beginning to seriously harm how well your heart works. Your heart valve has been damaged by infection of the heart valve (endocarditis). You have received a new heart valve in the past and it is not working well, or you have other problems such as blood clots, infection, or bleeding."

Possible risks from having open heart surgery are:
Heart attack or stroke Heart rhythm problems Incision infection, which is more likely to occur in people who are obese, have diabetes, or have already had this surgery Infection of the new valve Kidney failure Memory loss and loss of mental clarity, or ""fuzzy thinking"" Poor healing of the incision Post-pericardiotomy syndrome (low-grade fever and chest pain) that could last up to 6 months"

You will be moved to a regular hospital room from the ICU. Your nurses and doctors will continue to monitor your heart and vital signs until you are stable enough to go home. You will receive pain medicine to control pain around your surgical cut.
Your nurse will help you slowly resume some activity. You may begin a program to make your heart and body stronger.
A temporary pacemaker may be placed in your heart if your heart rate becomes too slow after surgery."
125,What are the symptoms of Atherosclerosis?,"Hardening of the arteries does not cause symptoms until blood flow to part of the body becomes slowed or blocked.
If the arteries to the heart become narrow, blood flow to the heart can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms.
Narrowed or blocked arteries may also cause problems and symptoms in your intestines, kidneys, legs, and brain."
126,What causes Atherosclerosis?,"Hardening of the arteries is a process that often occurs with aging. As you grow older, plaque buildup narrows your arteries and makes them stiffer. These changes make it harder for blood to flow through them.
Clots may form in these narrowed arteries and block blood flow. Pieces of plaque can also break off and move to smaller blood vessels, blocking them.
Either way, the blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen, which can result in damage or tissue death.This is a common cause of heart attack and stroke.
High blood cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries at a younger age."
127,Who is at highest risk for Atherosclerosis ?,"For many people, high cholesterol levels are the result of an unhealthy lifestyle -- most commonly, eating a diet that is high in fat. Other risk factors are heavy alcohol use, lack of exercise, and being overweight.
Other risk factors for hardening of the arteries are:
Diabetes Family history of hardening of the arteries High blood pressure Smoking"
128,What to expect if I have Atherosclerosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hardening of the arteries cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, lifestyle changes and treating high cholesterol levels can prevent or slow the process from becoming worse."
129,What are the Symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation?,"You may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern, especially if it has been occurring for some time.
Symptoms may include:
Pulse that feels rapid, racing, pounding, fluttering, or too slow Irregularly irregular pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) Shortness of breath while lying down (orthopnea) Confusion Dizziness, light-headedness Fainting (syncope) Fatigue
Note: Symptoms may begin or stop suddenly."
130,What Causes Atrial Fibrillation?,"Arrhythmias are caused by a disruption of the normal electrical conduction system of the heart.
Normally, the four chambers of the heart (two atria and two ventricles) contract in a very specific, coordinated way. The electrial impulse that signals your heart to contract in a synchronized way begins in the sinoatrial node (SA node). This node is your heart's natural pacemaker.
The signal leaves the SA node and travels through the two upper chambers (atria). Then the signal passes through another node (the AV node), and finally, through the lower chambers (ventricles). This path enables the chambers to contract in a coordinated fashion.
In atrial fibrillation, the atria are stimulated to contract very quickly and differently from the normal pattern. The impulses are sent to the ventricles in an irregular pattern. This makes the ventricles beat abnormally, leading to an irregular (and usually fast) pulse. In atrial flutter, the ventricles may beat very fast, but in a regular pattern. If the atrial fibrillation / flutter is part of a condition called sick sinus syndrome, the sinus node may not work properly and the heart rate may alternate between slow and fast. As a result, there may not be enough blood to meet the needs of the body.
Atrial fibrillation can affect both men and women. It becomes more common with increasing age.
Causes of atrial fibrillation include:
Alcohol abuse (especially binge drinking) Congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease (especially after a heart attack or coronary artery bypass surgery) Heart surgery Hypertension Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Medications e.g. porfimer sodium Hyperthyroidism Pericarditis Valvular heart disease (especially mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation)"
131,Where to Find Medical Care for Atrial Fibrillation?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Atrial fibrillation
132,What to expect if I have Atrial fibrillation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The disorder is usually controllable with treatment. Many people with atrial fibrillation do very well.
Atrial fibrillation tends to become a chronic condition, however, it may relapse even with treatment."
133,When could I drive after i underwent Atrial fibrillation ablation discharge instructions ?,You should not drive for 48 hours after the procedure.
134,What medications should I take after Atrial fibrillation ablation discharge instructions ?,"Have all of your prescriptions filled before you go home. You should take your drugs the way your doctor and nurse have told you to. Go back to taking any medicine you were on before, unless your doctor has told you otherwise. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking, including prescription medicines, non-prescription medicines, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.
You may have been given medicines to change your heartbeat or to slow it down. Some are:
Beta blockers, such as metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL) or atenolol (Senormin, Tenormin). Digoxin. Antiarrhythmics, such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone) or sotalol (Betapace). Medicines that help prevent or treat heart rhythms.
You may be taking aspirin or clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, or another blood thinner to help keep your blood from clotting. See also:
Aspirin and heart disease. Clopidogrel (Plavix). Taking warfarin (Coumadin).
If you are taking warfarin:
You will need to have extra blood tests to make sure your dose is correct. You need to watch for any bleeding or bruising, and let your doctor or nurse know if it happens. Your dentist, doctors, and pharmacist should all know you take this medicine."
135,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. If pain is not relieved with acetaminophen, contact your doctor. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and don’t take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
136,When may I resume my regular activities?,"One week after the procedure, you may resume your regular activities, including sexual activity. For at least one week, you should not lift, push, or pull anything heavier than 10 pounds or do any exercise that causes you to hold your breath and bear down with your abdominal muscles."
137,When should I bathe or swim?,You may remove the Band-aid over your puncture site and shower the day after the procedure.
138,When can I go back to work after Atrial fibrillation ablation discharge instructions ?,Ask your doctor when you may go back to work. This will depend on the type of work you do.
139,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atrial fibrillation ablation discharge instructions ?,"Call your 911 if you feel:
Pain, pressure, tightness, or heaviness in your chest, arm, neck, or jaw. Shortness of breath. Gas pains or indigestion. Sweaty, or if you lose color. Lightheaded. Fast heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, or your heart is pounding uncomfortably. Numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg. Blurry or decreased vision. Problems speaking or understanding speech. Dizziness, loss of balance, or falling. Severe headache. Bleeding."
140,What are the symptoms of Atrial flutter?,"You may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern. Symptoms may start or stop suddenly. This is because atrial fibrillation may stop or start on its own.
Symptoms may include:
Pulse that feels rapid, racing, pounding, fluttering, irregular, or too slow Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) Confusion Dizziness, light-headedness Fainting Fatigue Loss of ability to exercise Shortness of breath"
141,What causes Atrial flutter?,"Normally, the four chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in a very organized way. The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This helps the heart pump all the blood the body needs. In atrial fibrillation, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular.
Parts of the heart cannot contract in a coordinated pattern.
As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
In atrial flutter, the ventricles may beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern.These problems can affect both men and women and become more common as you get older. Common causes of atrial fibrillation include:
Alcohol use (especially binge drinking)
Coronary artery disease Heart attack or heart bypass surgery Heart failure or an enlarged heart Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve) Medications Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) Pericarditis Sick sinus syndrome"
142,Who is at highest risk for Atrial flutter ?,"Risk factors for the development of atrial flutter are:
Presence of heart disease Past history of cardiac surgery Hyperactive thyroid gland Abnormal heart valves Elderly age Chronic alcoholism Caffeine addiction Chronic use of diet pills and cold medications History of chronic pulmonary disease Stress and anxiety"
143,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atrial flutter ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation or flutter.
144,What to expect if I have Atrial flutter  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treatment can often control this disorder. Many people with atrial fibrillation do very well. However, atrial fibrillation tends to return and get worse. It may come back even with treatment. Clots that break off and travel to the brain can cause a stroke."
145,What are the symptoms of Atrial myxoma?,"Symptoms may occur at any time, but most often they accompany a change of body position. Symptoms may include:
Breathing difficulty that is relieved when lying flat (platypnea) Breathing difficulty when asleep Chest pain or tightness Dizziness Fainting Sensation of feeling your heart beat (palpitations) Shortness of breath with activity
The symptoms and signs of left atrial myxomas often mimic mitral stenosis.
General symptoms may also be present, such as:
Blueness of skin, especially the fingers (Raynaud's phenomenon) Cough Curvature of nails accompanied with soft tissue enlargement (clubbing) of the fingers Fever Fingers that change color upon pressure or with cold or stress General discomfort (malaise) Involuntary weight loss Joint pain Swelling - any part of the body
These general symptoms may also mimic those of infective endocarditis."
146,What causes Atrial myxoma?,"A myxoma is a primary heart (cardiac) tumor. This means that the tumor started within the heart. Most heart tumors start somewhere else. A tumor that originates elsewhere is called a metastatic tumor to the heart.
Primary cardiac tumors are rare. Myxomas are the most common type of these rare tumors. About 75% of myxomas occur in the left atrium of the heart, usually growing out of the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart. The rest are in the right atrium. Right atrial myxomas sometimes cause mechanical blockage of the heart valve a condition called tricuspid stenosis and an regular heartbeat, atrial fibrillation."
147,Who is at highest risk for Atrial myxoma ?,"Myxomas are more common in women. About 10% of myxomas are passed down through families (inherited). Such tumors are called familial myxomas. They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age than other myxomas."
148,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atrial myxoma ?,Tell your health care provider if there is any family history of myxomas or if you have symptoms of atrial myxoma.
149,What to expect if I have Atrial myxoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Although a myxoma is not cancer, complications are common. Untreated, a myxoma can lead to an embolism (tumor cells breaking off and traveling with the bloodstream), which can block blood flow or cause the myxoma to grow in another part of the body. Myxoma fragments can move to the brain, eye, or limbs.
If the tumor grows inside the heart, it can block blood flow through the mitral valve and cause symptoms of mitral stenosis. This may require emergency surgery to prevent sudden death."
150,What are the Symptoms of Atrial Septal Defect?,"When a person has no other congenital defect, symptoms may be absent, especially in children. Symptoms may begin any time after birth through childhood and even into adulthood. Symptoms may include:
Difficulty breathing Heart palpitations in adults Frequent respiratory infections in children Shortness of breath with activity
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
151,What Causes Atrial Septal Defect?,"A heart normally develops with a small opening between the two upper chambers of the heart (called atria) to allow blood to bypass the lungs. As the lungs become more developed, the heart no longer needs to bypass the blood and the opening between atria will close. An atrial septal defect occurs when the opening between the two chambers does not close completely In rare cases, the hole may spontaneously close after birth. Shunting refers to when the blood flows from the left chamber to the right chamber.
If too much blood moves from the right side of the heart, pressures in the lungs build up. The shunt can be reversed so that blood flows from right to left.
{{#ev:youtube|e46jtin-H50}}"
152,Who is at highest risk for Atrial septal defect ?,"Worldwide, atrial septal defects occur in 1 in 1500 live births. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that, every year, 1,966 babies in the United States are born with an atrial septal defect. As with most congenital heart diseases, it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with atrial septal defects. More commonly found in women than men, the female-to-male ratio of 2:1. More common in families with a history of genetic problems and other congenital heart diseases.
Certain types of atrial septal defects are associated to down syndrome. Genetic counseling may be performed to estimate the likelihood that any future children may be born with an atrial septal defect.
Expectant mothers exposed to rubella may have an increased risk in having a baby with a heart defect. Drug and alcohol use during pregnancy can harm fetal development. Alcohol use during pregnancy nearly doubles the likelihood of an atrial septal defect."
153,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atrial septal defect ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has the following symptoms as soon as possible:
Heart failure Shortness of breath (Dyspnea) Bluish coloring to the skin Failure to thrive
Call your health care provider if you are an adult experiencing the following symptoms:
Heart failure Shortness of breath (Dyspnea) Bluish coloring to the skin Pounding or racing of the heart"
154,Where to Find Medical Care for an Atrial Septal Defect?,Directions to hospitals treating atrial septal defects
155,What to expect if I have Atrial septal defect  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Small atrial septal defects often cause very few problems and may be found much later in life. Many problems can occur if the shunt is large, however. In advanced and severe cases with large shunts the increased pressure on the right side of the heart would result in reversal of blood flow (now from right to left). This usually results in significant shortness of breath. With a small to moderate atrial septal defect, a person may live a normal life span without symptoms. Larger defects may cause disability by middle age because of increased blood flow and shunting of blood back into the pulmonary circulation. Some patients with ASD may have other congenital heart conditions, such as a leaky valve."
156,What are the symptoms of Atrioventricular canal defect?,"Symptoms associated with an atrioventricular canal defect depend largely on the type of defect: partial or complete. A partial atrioventricular canal defect involves a malformation of the upper two chambers of the heart only. A complete atrioventricular canal defect is a malformation that allows blood to freely circulate amongst all four of the heart's chambers. In both partial and complete defects there is an increased, extra amount of blood that circulates to the lungs.
Complete atrioventricular canal defect: Signs/symptoms of a complete defect usually present within the first few weeks of life. Common symptoms include:
Poor appetite Difficulty gaining weight Blue discoloring of the skin (cyanosis) Difficulty breathing/respiratory distress Heart failure (signs include: wheezing, swelling of the legs, ankles, and feet, excessive sweating, sudden gaining of eight, irregular/fast heartbeat)
Partial atrioventricular canal defect: Signs/symptoms of a partial defect usually are asymptomatic (meaning without symptoms) until much later in life into adulthood. Common symptoms include:
An abnormal heart rhythm/heartbeat (arrhythmia) Heart failure High blood pressure, specifically within the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)"
157,What causes atrioventricular canal defect?,"The exact cause of an atrioventricular canal defect is unknown. There is some evidence to suggest a genetic component, especially in relation to Down syndrome as many Down syndrome patients have heart defects at birth."
158,Who is at highest risk for Atrioventricular canal defect ?,"Like most congenital heart defects, it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with atrioventricular canal defects. There is evidence, however, to suggest that certain factors may increase the risk for a congenital heart defect. Risk factors include:
A family history of Down syndrome/chromosomal disorders A family history of congenital heart defect Expectant mothers who: Contract German measles or other viral illnesses in the first trimester Drink too much alcohol during pregnancy Poorly manage diabetes during pregnancy Take certain prescriptions during pregnancy, such as Accutane (a popular acne medicine noted for causing birth defects)."
159,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atrioventricular canal defect ?,"Contact your health care provider immediately if your child develops signs of heart failure, such as:
Decreased/poor appetite Shortness of breath Extreme fatigue/easy tiring Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet A blue discoloration to the skin Failure to thrive/gain weight"
160,What to expect if I have Atrioventricular canal defect  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After a successful surgery, the prognosis is good. Children are likely to lead a normal, healthy life without activity restrictions. Care, however, is lifelong and requires yearly follow-ups to track progress and monitor potential complications, such as a leaky heart valve.
Children will also have to take preventative antibiotics prior to any procedures, dental or surgical. These preventative antibiotics help minimize the potential risk of complications such as endocarditis, a bacterial infection occurring within the lining of the heart that can be very severe and life-threatening. Endocarditis is more common:
When the child may have lingering defects post-surgery. After surgery with an artificial valve repair. After surgical patching utilizing artificial materials.
Often, adults may not need any additional surgery. Women anticipating childbearing must have an atrioventricular canal defect evaluated by a cardiologist prior to pregnancy."
161,What are the symptoms of Beriberi ?,"Symptoms of dry beriberi include:
Difficulty walking Loss of feeling (sensation) in hands and feet Loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs Mental confusion/speech difficulties Pain Strange eye movements (nystagmus) Tingling Vomiting
Symptoms of wet beriberi include:
Awakening at night short of breath Increased heart rate Shortness of breath with activity Swelling of the lower legs"
162,What are the causes of Beriberi ?,"There are two major types of beriberi:
Wet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome affect the nervous system.
Beriberi is rare in the United States because most foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in patients who abuse alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition, and excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store thiamine.
A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families). People with genetic beriberi lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time and symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, because doctors may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics, this diagnosis is often missed.
Beriberi can occur in breast-fed infants when the mother's body is lacking in thiamine. The condition can also affect infants who are fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine.
Getting dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics raise your risk of beriberi."
163,When to Contact a Medical Professional?,"Beriberi is extremely rare in the United States. However, if you feel your family's diet is inadequate or poorly balanced, and you or your children have any symptoms of beriberi, call your health care provider."
164,What to expect if I have Beriberi  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Untreated, beriberi is often deadly. With treatment, symptoms usually improve quickly.
Heart damage is usually reversible, and a full recovery is expected. However, if acute heart failure has already occurred, the outlook is poor.
Nervous system damage is also reversible, if caught early. If it is not caught early, some symptoms (such as memory loss) may remain even with treatment.
If a patient with Wernicke's encephalopathy receives thiamine replacement, language problems, unusual eye movements, and walking difficulties may go away. However, Korsakoff syndrome (or Korsakoff psychosis) tends to develop as Wernicke's symptoms go away."
165,What are the symptoms of Bicuspid aortic stenosis?,"Most of the time, bicuspid aortic valve is not diagnosed in infants or children because it causes no symptoms. However, the abnormal valve can leak or become narrow.
Symptoms of such complications may include:
Baby or child tires easily Chest pain Difficulty breathing Rapid and irregular heartbeat (palpitations) Loss of consciousness (fainting) Pale skin
If a baby has other congenital heart problems, they may cause symptoms that will lead to the discovery of a bicuspid aortic valve."
166,What causes Bicuspid aortic stenosis?,"The aortic valve allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from the heart to the aorta. It prevents the blood from flowing back from the aorta into the heart when the pumping chamber relaxes.
Bicuspid aortic valve is present at birth (congenital). An abnormal aortic valve develops during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the baby's heart develops. The cause of this problem is unclear, but it is the most common congenital heart disease. It often runs in families.
The bicuspid aortic valve may not be completely effective at stopping blood from leaking back into the heart. This is called aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve may also become stiff and not open up as well, causing the heart to have to pump harder than usual to get blood past the valve (aortic stenosis). The aorta may become enlarged with this condition.
This condition is more common among males than females.
A bicuspid aortic valve often exists in babies with coarctation of the aorta and other diseases in which there is a blockage to blood flow on the left side of the heart."
167,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bicuspid aortic stenosis ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby:
Has no appetite Has unusually pale or bluish skin Seems to tire easily"
168,What to expect if I have Bicuspid aortic stenosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well the baby does depends on whether complications of bicuspid aortic valve are present, and how severe they are.
The presence of other physical problems at birth also can affect how well a baby does.
Most babies with this condition have no symptoms, and the problem is not diagnosed until they are adults. Some people never find out that they have this problem."
169,What are the symptoms of Brugada syndrome?,"Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although signs and symptoms, including sudden death, can occur any time from early infancy to old age. The mean age of sudden death is approximately 40 years. This condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of death in babies younger than one year. It is characterized by sudden and unexplained death, usually during sleep.
Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) is a condition characterized by unexpected cardiac arrest in young adults, usually at night during sleep. This condition was originally described in Southeast Asian populations, where it is a major cause of death. Researchers have determined that SUNDS and Brugada syndrome are the same disorder."
170,What causes Brugada syndrome?,"Mutations in the SCN5A gene cause Brugada syndrome.
Mutations in the SCN5A gene have been identified in fewer than one-third of people with Brugada syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a sodium channel, which normally transports positively charged sodium atoms (ions) into heart muscle cells. This type of ion channel plays a critical role in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in the SCN5A gene alter the structure or function of the channel, which reduces the flow of sodium ions into cells. A disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of Brugada syndrome.
In affected people without an identified SCN5A mutation, the cause of Brugada syndrome is often unknown. In some cases, certain drugs may cause a nongenetic (acquired) form of the disorder. Drugs that can induce an altered heart rhythm include medications used to treat some forms of arrhythmia, a condition called angina (which causes chest pain), high blood pressure, depression, and other mental illnesses. Abnormally high blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia) or potassium (hyperkalemia), as well as unusually low potassium levels (hypokalemia), also have been associated with acquired Brugada syndrome. In addition to causing a nongenetic form of this disorder, these factors may trigger symptoms in people with an underlying SCN5A mutation."
171,Who is at highest risk for Brugada syndrome ?,"This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
172,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Brugada syndrome ?,"Patients with Brugada syndrome should immediately be transported to the hospital if they suffer from cardiac arrest. Patients should seek medical care when there are symptoms such as syncope, seizures, or shortness of breath."
173,What to expect if I have Brugada syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although it may present in infants and children as sudden cardiac death. The mean age of sudden death in patients with Brugada syndrome is 40 years old. The Brugada patient may develop atrial arrhythmia."
174,What are the symptoms of Buerger's disease?,"Patients with Buerger's disease may experience symptoms as the following:
Pain and weakness in the legs and feet or arms and hands Swelling in your feet and hands Fingers and toes that turn pale when exposed to cold (Raynaud's phenomenon) Skin ulcers
Diseases with similar symptoms:
Atherosclerosis Raynaud phenomenon Frostbite Scleroderma Systemic lupus erythematosus"
175,What causes Buerger's disease?,"Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) is caused by vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels).
The blood vessels of the hands and feet are especially affected. They tighten or become totally blocked. The average age when symptoms begin is around 35 years. Woman and older adults are affected less often.
Thromboangiitis obliterans mostly affects men ages 20 to 40 who have a history of heavy smoking or chewing tobacco. Only 1 out of 10 patients are women.
The condition may also be related to a history of Raynaud's disease.
This disorder is very uncommon in children, but it may occur in children with autoimmune diseases."
176,Who is at highest risk for Buerger%27s disease ?,"Smoking Patients with medical history of Raynaud's disease or autoimmune diseases Race: Buerger disease is relatively more common in people of natives of India, Korea, and Japan, and Israeli Jews of Ashkenazi descent. Gender: Buerger disease is as 3 times as common in males than in female. Age between 20~45 years"
177,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Buerger%27s disease ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of Buerger's disease develop.
178,What to expect if I have Buerger%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of Buerger's disease varies from person to person, depending on:
The patient's life-style The severity of the damaged vessles"
179,What are the Symptoms of Cardiac Amyloidosis?,"Most patients with cardiac amyloidosis may experience symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy, while others may show no symptoms. Common symptoms include:
Skipped heart beats or extra heart beats also known as Palpitations Shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing while lying flat also known as orthopnea Fatigue Increased urination at night also known as nocturia Swelling of the ankles, the legs, or other part of the body
Diseases with similar symptoms:
Coronary artery disease Constrictive pericarditis Dilated cardiomyopathy Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy Sarcoidosis cordis"
180,What Causes Cardiac Amyloidosis?,"Amyloidosis refers to a family of diseases in which there is a buildup of clumps of proteins called amyloids in body tissues and organs. These proteins slowly replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis that may involve specific organs like the heart (cardiac amlyoidosis), the neurologic system with a peripheral neuropathy or the kidney. Cardiac amyloidosis usually occurs as part of primary amyloidosis (AL type amyloidosis). Primary amyloidosis is often seen in people with multiple myeloma and cancer. Cardiac amyloidosis ("" stiff heart syndrome "") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical form of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical impulses move through the heart (electrical conduction system). This can lead to irregular heart beating also known as arrhythmias and failure of the electrical impulses to conduct through the heart (heart block). Secondary amyloidosis (AA type amyloidosis) rarely affects the heart. However, one form of secondary amyloidosis called senile amyloidosis may involve the heart and blood vessels. Senile amyloidosis is caused by overproduction of a different protein. The condition is becoming more common as the average age of the population increases.
There is no difference in the incidence of cardiac amyloidosis between men and women as it affects both genders equally. The disease is rare in people under age 40."
181,Who Is at the Highest Risk?,"Amyloidosis refers to abnormal deposition of amyloid protein in the body tissues and organs. These proteins gradually replace the normal tissue resulting in organ dysfunction. Amyloidosis often occurs in patients with the following diseases or characteristics:
Multiple myeloma: Cardiac amyloidosis usually occurs in patients with multiple myeloma. Age over 40: The disease is rare in people under age 40."
182,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiac amyloidosis ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis develop. If you experience any of the following symptoms, seek urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Skipped heart beats or extra heart beats also known as palpitations Severe shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing while lying flat also known as orthopnea"
183,Where to Find Medical Care for Cardiac Amyloidosis?,Directions to Hospitals Treating cardiac amyloidosis
184,What to expect if I have Cardiac amyloidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cardiac amyloidosis is a long-term (chronic) condition that slowly worsens. On average, persons with cardiac amyloidosis live less than 1 year."
185,What are the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia?,"When you have an arrhythmia, your heartbeat may be:
Too slow (bradycardia)
Too quick (tachycardia)
Irregular, uneven or skipping beats
An arrhythmia may be present all of the time or it may come and go. You may or may not feel symptoms when the arrhythmia is present. Or, you may only notice symptoms when you are more active. Symptoms can be very mild, or they may be severe or even life-threatening.
Common symptoms that may occur when the arrhythmia is present include:
Chest pain
Fainting
Light-headedness, dizziness
Paleness
Shortness of breath
Sweating"
186,What causes cardiac arrhythmia?,"Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way.
The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This is your heart's natural pacemaker.
The signal leaves the SA node and travels though the heart along a set electrical pathway.
Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster.
Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system.
Abnormal extra signals may occur
Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed
Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart
Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are:
Abnormal levels of potassium or other substances
Heart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack
Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital)
Heart failure or an enlarged heart
Overactive thyroid gland
Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including:
Alcohol, caffiene, or stimulants such as amphetamines
Beta-blockers
Cigarette smoking
Drugs that mimic the activity of the nervous system
Medications used for depression or psychosis
Sometimes anti-arrhythmic medications prescribed to treat one type of arrhythmia will cause another type of arrhythmia.
Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are:
Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter
Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT)
Multifocal atrial tachycardia
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
Heart block or atrioventricular block
Sick sinus syndrome
Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"
187,Who is at highest risk for Cardiac arrhythmia ?,"Risk factors for cardiac arrhythmia include:
Hypertension or high blood pressure Previous heart surgery Congenital heart disease Thyroid problems Drugs and certain supplements Obesity Diabetes Obstructive sleep apnea Drinking too much alcohol Caffeine and nicotine use Electrolyte imbalances"
188,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiac arrhythmia ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop any of the symptoms of a possible arrhythmia You have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia and your symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment"
189,What to expect if I have Cardiac arrhythmia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on several factors:
The kind of arrhythmia -- some arrhythmias may be life threatening if not treated right away, or do not respond well to treatment Whether you have coronary artery disease, heart failure, or valvular heart disease"
190,When could I drive after i underwent Cardiac catheterization discharge instructions ?,You should not drive for 48 hours after the procedure.
191,What medications should I take after Cardiac catheterization discharge instructions ?,Ask your doctor whether you should go back to taking the medications you were on before the procedure. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking.
192,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and do not take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
193,When may I resume my regular activities?,"You may resume your regular activities one week after the procedure. Avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than 10 pounds in the first week after the procedure. Also avoid any exercise that causes you to hold your breath and bear down with your abdominal muscles. Begin your exercise program one week after the procedure at half your usual routine, then gradually work back to your full routine. Please ask your doctor about your exercise instructions."
194,When could I bathe or swim?,"Usually after one week, when the puncture site is healed. This usually takes about a week. You may shower on the day after the procedure after removing the Band-aid over your puncture site."
195,When can I go back to work after Cardiac catheterization discharge instructions ?,It depends on the type of your work. You can ask your doctor when you can go back to work.
196,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiac catheterization discharge instructions ?,"Call your doctor if:
There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when you apply pressure. Your arm or leg below where the catheter was inserted changes color, is cool to the touch, or is numb. The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. Your pulse feels irregular -- it is very slow (fewer than 60 beats a minute) or very fast (over 100 to 120 beats a minute). You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus You have problems taking any of your heart medicines. You have chills or a fever over 101 °F."
197,What to eat at the restaurant?,"Ask about low-fat or fat-free choices. Ask the server to make substitutions like steamed vegetables instead of French fries. Use the basic guidelines of your healthy eating plan when choosing a main dish. Pick lean meat, fish or skinless chicken. Make sure your entrée is broiled, baked, grilled, steamed or poached instead of fried. Order vegetable side dishes and ask that any sauces or butter be left off. Ask for low-calorie salad dressing or a lemon to squeeze on your salad instead of dressing. Ask for baked, boiled or roasted potatoes instead of fried. And ask for them without the butter and sour cream. Order fresh fruit or fruit sorbet in place of cake, pie or ice cream. When it seems that everything on the menu is “off limits,” ask if the chef will make you a fruit or vegetable platter. Most chefs are happy to do so."
198,What to avoid at the restaurant?,"Push the butter out of your way or ask that it be removed. Ask for soft margarine instead. Order your dressings and sauces on the side so you can control how much you use. Stay away from fried appetizers and creamy soups. Begin your meal with broth-based soup like minestrone or gazpacho. At salad bars, stay away from high-fat items like cheese, cream dressings, chopped eggs, croutons, olives and bacon bits. Ask that your food be made without butter or cream sauces. You’ll be surprised at how delicious meat, fish and chicken can be when broiled “dry.” Take the skin off poultry when it arrives, and remove visible fat from meat."
199,What are the symptoms of cardiac tamponade?,"Anxiety, restlessness Chest pain - Sharp and stabbing pain which worsens with deep breathing or coughing. Difficulty breathing Discomfort, sometimes relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward Fainting, light-headedness Pale, gray, or blue skin Palpitations Rapid breathing Swelling of the abdomen or other areas Low blood pressure Weak or absent pulse"
200,What causes cardiac tamponade?,"Cardiac tamponade can occur when fluid or blood rapidly accumulates in pericardial cavity and thereby cause elevated intrapericardial pressure. Below are few of the causes for fluid in pericardium leading to cardiac tamponade.
Chest trauma Rupture of aortic aneurysm (thoracic) End-stage lung cancer Heart attack (acute MI) Heart surgery Pericarditis caused by bacterial or viral infections Wounds to the heart Heart tumors Hypothyroidism Kidney failure Placement of central lines Radiation therapy to the chest Recent invasive heart procedures Recent open heart surgery Systemic lupus erythematosus"
201,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiac tamponade ?,Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if symptoms develop. Cardiac tamponade is an emergency condition requiring immediate attention.
202,What are the symptoms of Atrial myxoma?,"Symptoms may occur at any time, but most often they accompany a change of body position. Symptoms may include:
Breathing difficulty that is relieved when lying flat (platypnea) Breathing difficulty when asleep Chest pain or tightness Dizziness Fainting Sensation of feeling your heart beat (palpitations) Shortness of breath with activity
The symptoms and signs of left atrial myxomas often mimic mitral stenosis.
General symptoms may also be present, such as:
Blueness of skin, especially the fingers (Raynaud's phenomenon) Cough Curvature of nails accompanied with soft tissue enlargement (clubbing) of the fingers Fever Fingers that change color upon pressure or with cold or stress General discomfort (malaise) Involuntary weight loss Joint pain Swelling - any part of the body
These general symptoms may also mimic those of infective endocarditis."
203,What causes Atrial myxoma?,"A myxoma is a primary heart (cardiac) tumor. This means that the tumor started within the heart. Most heart tumors start somewhere else. A tumor that originates elsewhere is called a metastatic tumor to the heart.
Primary cardiac tumors are rare. Myxomas are the most common type of these rare tumors. About 75% of myxomas occur in the left atrium of the heart, usually growing out of the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart. The rest are in the right atrium. Right atrial myxomas sometimes cause mechanical blockage of the heart valve a condition called tricuspid stenosis and an regular heartbeat, atrial fibrillation."
204,Who is at highest risk for Cardiac tumors ?,"Myxomas are more common in women. About 10% of myxomas are passed down through families (inherited). Such tumors are called familial myxomas. They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age than other myxomas."
205,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiac tumors ?,Tell your health care provider if there is any family history of myxomas or if you have symptoms of atrial myxoma.
206,What to expect if I have Cardiac tumors  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Although a myxoma is not cancer, complications are common. Untreated, a myxoma can lead to an embolism (tumor cells breaking off and traveling with the bloodstream), which can block blood flow or cause the myxoma to grow in another part of the body. Myxoma fragments can move to the brain, eye, or limbs.
If the tumor grows inside the heart, it can block blood flow through the mitral valve and cause symptoms of mitral stenosis. This may require emergency surgery to prevent sudden death."
207,What are the symptoms of Cardiogenic shock?,"Chest pain or pressure Coma Decreased urination Fast breathing Fast pulse Heavy sweating, moist skin Lightheadedness Loss of alertness and ability to concentrate Restlessness, agitation, confusion Shortness of breath Skin that feels cool to the touch Pale skin color or blotchy skin Weak (thready) pulse"
208,What causes Cardiogenic shock?,"Cardiogenic shock occurs whenever the heart is unable to pump as much blood as the body needs.
The most common causes are serious heart complications. Many of these occur during or after a heart attack (myocardial infarction). These complications include:
A large section of heart muscle that no longer moves well or does not move at all Breaking open (rupture) of the heart muscle due to damage from the heart attack Dangerous heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or supraventricular tachycardia Pressure on the heart due to a build up of fluid around it (pericardial tamponade) Tear or rupture of the muscles or tendons that support the heart valves, especially the mitral valve Tear or rupture of the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles (lower heart chambers) Very slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) or problem with the electrical system of the heart (heart block)"
209,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiogenic shock ?,Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency.
210,What to expect if I have Cardiogenic shock  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In the past, the death rate from cardiogenic shock ranged from 80 - 90%. In more recent studies, this rate has decreased to 50 - 75%.
When cardiogenic shock is not treated, the outlook is poor."
211,What are the symptoms of cardiomegaly?,"It can present with the following symptoms:
Shortness of breath Dizziness Swelling (edema) Abnormal rhythm (arrhythmia) Cough
It can also be asymptomatic in some people."
212,What causes Cardiomegaly?,"Cardiomegaly can occur in various disease conditions like congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, hemochromatosis, HIV, pulmonary hypertension and high blood pressure etc. It can also occur in some storage diseases like Fabry disease, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis etc. It can also occur in other conditions like alcoholism, cocaine and crack abuse, pregnancy."
213,Who is at highest risk for Cardiomegaly ?,"Cardiomegaly as mentioned above is a physical sign so the patient is at risk if present with the following conditions like:
High blood pressure Positive family history of cardiomyopathy Coronary artery disease Congenital heart disease"
214,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiomegaly ?,One should seek medical care when suffering from symptoms of cardiomegaly or a positive family history.
215,What are the symptoms of Cardiomyopathy?,"In early stages of the disease, some patient might be asymptomatic. During the course of the disease it can present with the following symptoms
Breathlessness which can be exertional or at rest. Swelling of lower limbs. Fatigue and fainting. Irregular heart beat."
216,What causes Cardiomyopathy?,"Heart attacks, high blood pressure, nutritional deficiencies, pregnancy, alcohol / cocaine abuse or infections can all cause cardiomyopathy. Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families. In many people, however, the cause is unknown"
217,Who is at highest risk for Cardiomyopathy ?,"People of all ages and races can have cardiomyopathy. However, certain types of the disease are more common in certain groups.
Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common in african americans than caucasians. This type of the disease also is more common in men than women.
Teens and young adults are more likely than older people to have arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, although it's rare in both groups.
Certain diseases, conditions, or factors can raise your risk for cardiomyopathy. Major risk factors include:
A family history of cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) A disease or condition that can lead to cardiomyopathy, such as coronary heart disease, heart attack, or a viral infection that inflames the heart muscle Diabetes or other metabolic diseases, or severe obesity Diseases that can damage the heart, such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, or amyloidosis Long-term alcoholism Long-term high blood pressure
Some people who have cardiomyopathy never have signs or symptoms. Thus, it's important to identify people who may be at high risk for the disease. This can help prevent future problems, such as serious arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) or SCA."
218,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cardiomyopathy ?,One should seek medical care when suffering from symptoms of cardiomyopathy or a positive family history.
219,What to expect if I have Cardiomyopathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some people live long, healthy lives with cardiomyopathy. Some people don't even realize they have it. In others, however, it can make the heart less able to pump blood through the body
Some people who have cardiomyopathy—especially those who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)—may live a healthy life with few problems or symptoms. Others may have serious symptoms and complications."
220,What are the symptoms of Carotid artery stenosis?,"You may not have any symptoms or you may have symptoms of a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Some of these symptoms include:
Weakness in one part of your body Blurred vision Confusion Loss of memory Problems with speech and language Loss of sensation"
221,What causes Carotid artery stenosis?,"Carotid artery disease occurs when sticky, fatty substances called plaque build up in the inner lining of the arteries. The plaque may slowly block or narrow the carotid artery or cause a clot (thrombus) to form. Clots can lead to stroke."
222,Who is at highest risk for Carotid artery stenosis ?,"Risk factors for blockage or narrowing of the arteries include:
High blood pressure Diabetes Heart disease High cholesterol Heavy alcohol use Kidney disease, especially when dialysis is needed Cocaine abuse Family history of stroke Increasing age
Smoking is also a risk factor. Smoking increases the risk of most types of stroke. People who smoke one pack a day have over two times the risk of stroke compared to nonsmokers.
Two uncommon conditions called Marfan syndrome and fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal growth or development of the cells in the walls of carotid arteries) may also cause narrowing of the carotid arteries."
223,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Carotid artery stenosis ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) as soon as symptoms occur. When having a stroke, every second of delay can result in more brain injury."
224,What to expect if I have Carotid artery stenosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Some people who have a stroke recover most or all of their functions. Others die from the stroke itself or from complications. About half of those who have a stroke have long-term problems.
225,What are the symptoms of Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?,"The symptoms typically start with ventricular tachycardia (VT) during physical activity or emotional stress:
Fainting is commonly the first sign of the disease Light-headedness or dizziness Palpitations or unpleasant awareness of the heartbeat
Sometimes the ventricular tachycardia goes away, and symptoms stop. At times, ventricular tachycardia can turn into ventricular fibrillation (VF) in which the ventricles quiver and are unable to pump blood. This sudden loss of heart function leads to sudden cardiac arrest. A person stops breathing and becomes unresponsive. Unfortunately, sudden cardiac arrest is sometimes the first sign of CPVT. Sudden cardiac arrest can lead to sudden cardiac death."
226,What causes Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?,"CPVT is caused by a gene defect (abnormal gene). Genes are part of your DNA, the material passed down from parents to children, which can be passed down through families and inherited in different ways (from either one or both parents). In some cases, CPVT is autosomal dominant which means you need an abnormal gene from only one of your parents to have it. In other cases, CPVT is autosomal recessive which means you need an abnormal gene from both of your parents to get the disease. CPVT can result from mutations in genes such as RYR2 and CASQ2. RYR2 gene mutations cause about half of all cases, while mutations in the CASQ2 gene account for 1 percent to 2 percent of cases. The RYR2 and CASQ2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that help maintain a regular heartbeat. For the heart to beat normally, heart muscle cells called myocytes must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Both the RYR2 and CASQ2 proteins are involved in handling calcium within myocytes, which is critical for the regular contraction of these cells. Mutations in either the RYR2 and CASQ2 gene disrupt the handling of calcium within myocytes. During exercise or emotional stress, impaired calcium regulation in the heart can lead to ventricular tachycardia in people with CPVT. Stress and exercise can trigger episodes. Certain medicines, such as catecholamines, can also make it worse."
227,Who is at highest risk for Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?,"Children and young adults Having a relative with CPVT Family history of fainting (syncope) or sudden death.
Thus, if you or someone in your family has CPVT, you and all other family members should see a healthcare provider to get checked. You may need a genetic test."
228,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a rapid, irregular pulse, faint, or have chest pain. All of these may be signs of ventricular tachycardia."
229,What to expect if I have Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis is generally poor. But CPVT can be managed with medication compliance, ICD, regular monitoring with exercise testing and follow-ups."
230,What are the symptoms of Cerebral aneurysm?,"A person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason.
A cerebral aneurysm may begin to ""leak"" a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a patient may describe as ""the worst headache of my life."" Another phrase used to describe this is a sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a rupture days or weeks after the headache first happens.
Symptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain.
Symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on, but may include:
Double vision Loss of vision Headaches Eye pain Neck pain Stiff neck
A sudden, severe headache is one symptom of an aneurysm that has ruptured. Other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture may include:
Confusion, lethargy, sleepiness, or stupor Eyelid drooping Headaches with nausea or vomiting Muscle weakness or difficulty moving any part of the body Numbness or decreased sensation in any part of the body Seizures Speech impairment Stiff neck (occasionally) Vision changes (double vision, loss of vision)
NOTE: A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Seek immediate medical help."
231,What causes Cerebral aneurysm?,"Aneurysms in the brain occur when there is a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm may be present from birth (congenital) or it may develop later in life, such as after a blood vessel is injured.
There are many different types of aneurysms. A berry aneurysm can vary in size from a few millimeters to over a centimeter. Giant berry aneurysms can reach well over 2 centimeters. These are more common in adults. Multiple berry aneurysms are inherited more often than other types of aneurysms.
Other types of cerebral aneurysm involve widening of an entire blood vessel, or they may appear as a ""ballooning out"" of part of a blood vessel. Such aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel that supplies the brain. Atherosclerosis, trauma, and infection, which can injure the blood vessel wall, can cause cerebral aneurysms."
232,Who is at highest risk for Cerebral aneurysm ?,"About 5% of the population has some type of aneurysm in the brain, but only a small number of these aneurysms cause symptoms or rupture. Risk factors include a family history of cerebral aneurysms, and certain medical problems such as polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, and high blood pressure."
233,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cerebral aneurysm ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a sudden or severe headache, especially if you also have nausea, vomiting, seizures, or any other neurological symptoms.
Also call if you have a headache that is unusual for you, especially if it is severe or your worst headache ever."
234,What to expect if I have Cerebral aneurysm  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies. Patients who are in deep comas after an aneurysm rupture generally do not do as well as those with less severe symptoms.
Ruptured cerebral aneurysms are often deadly. About 25% of people die within 1 day, and another 25% die within about 3 months. Of those who survive, about 25% will have some sort of permanent disability."
235,What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?,"Chagas disease has two phases -- acute and chronic. The acute phase may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. Symptoms include:
Fever General ill feeling (malaise) Swelling of one eye Swollen red area at site of insect bite
After the acute phase the disease goes into remission. No other symptoms may appear for many years. When symptoms finally develop, they may include:
Constipation Digestive problems Pain in the abdomen Swallowing difficulties"
236,What causes Chagas disease?,"Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite related to the African trypanosome that causes sleeping sickness. It is spread by reduvid bugs and is one of the major health problems in South America. Due to immigration, the disease also affects people in the United States."
237,Who is at highest risk for Chagas disease ?,"Risk factors for Chagas disease include:
Living in a hut where reduvid bugs live in the walls Living in Central or South America Poverty Receiving a blood transfusion from a person who carries the parasite but does not have active Chagas disease"
238,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chagas disease ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you may be infected with Chagas disease.
239,What to expect if I have Chagas disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"About 30% of infected people who are not treated will develop chronic or symptomatic Chagas disease. It may take more than 20 years from the time of the original infection to develop heart or digestive problems. Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia) may cause sudden death. Once heart failure develops, death usually occurs within several years."
240,What causes Chest pain?,"Many people with chest pain fear a heart attack. However, there are many possible causes of chest pain. Some causes are mildly inconvenient, while other causes are serious, even life-threatening. Any organ or tissue in your chest can be the source of pain, including your heart, lungs, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, or nerves.
Heart problems that can cause chest pain:
Angina is a type of heart-related chest pain. This pain occurs because your heart is not getting enough blood and oxygen. The most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breast bone or slightly to the left of it. It may feel like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or crushing pain. The pain may spread to the arm, shoulder, jaw, or back. Heart attack pain can be similar to the pain of unstable angina, but more severe. Aortic dissection causes sudden, severe pain in the chest and upper back. Inflammation or infection in the tissue around the heart (pericarditis) causes pain in the center part of the chest.
Lung problems that can cause chest pain:
Pneumonia, which causes chest pain that usually feels sharp, and often gets worse when you take a deep breath or cough A blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism), collapse of a small area of the lung (pneumothorax), or inflammation of the lining around the lung (pleurisy) can cause chest pain that usually feels sharp, and often gets worse when you take a deep breath or cough Asthma, which generally also causes shortness of breath, wheezing, or coughing
Other causes of chest pain:
Strain or inflammation of the muscles and tendons between the ribs Inflammation where the ribs join the breast bone or sternum (costochondritis) Shingles (sharp, tingling pain on one side that stretches from the chest to the back) Anxiety and rapid breathing
Chest pain can also be related to the following digestive system problems:
Heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Stomach ulcer (burning pain occurs if your stomach is empty and feels better when you eat food) Gallbladder (pain often gets worse after a meal, especially a fatty meal)
In children, most chest pain is not caused by the heart."
241,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chest pain ?,"Call 911 if:
You have sudden crushing, squeezing, tightening, or pressure in your chest. Pain radiates to your jaw, left arm, or between your shoulder blades. You have nausea, dizziness, sweating, a racing heart, or shortness of breath. You know you have angina and your chest discomfort is suddenly more intense, brought on by lighter activity, or lasts longer than usual. Your angina symptoms occur at rest. You have sudden sharp chest pain with shortness of breath, especially after a long trip, a stretch of bedrest (for example, following an operation), or other lack of movement that can lead to a blood clot in your leg.
Know that your risk of heart attack is greater if you have a family history of heart disease, you smoke, use cocaine, are overweight, or you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes.
Call your doctor if:
You have a fever or a cough that produces yellow-green phlegm. You have chest pain that is severe and does not go away. You are having problems swallowing. Chest wall pain persists for longer than 3 to 5 days."
242,What are the symptoms of angina?,"It's important to know the symptoms of angina and to seek medical help if you think you are experiencing angina. Symptoms of angina can include one or more of the following:
Chest discomfort:
A common precipitating factor is exertion. Other precipitating factors include emotional stress, large meals, and cold weather. The discomfort is often described as a sense of heaviness, squeezing, pressure, or band like tightness. Most anginal discomfort is located in the center of the chest behind the breast bone and lasts between 1-15 minutes. Pain is relieved with rest or by a medicine called nitroglycerin. Spreading pain that extends to left arm, shoulder, back, neck or jaw.
Shortness of breath: You may feel tired and be short of breath Sweaty Feeling Lightheaded Unexplained tiredness after activity You may also have indigestion or be sick to your stomach A sensation in which you can feel your heart beating irregularly or too fast: palpitations"
243,What should you ask your doctor?,{{#ev:youtube|p47QFhkKKfI}}
244,What causes angina?,Angina is a symptom of underlying coronary artery disease that is characterized by a fatty material called plaque that builds up over many years on the inner walls of the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart). This build up limits the blood supply to the heart (as shown in the video below). Blood supply is specifically limited when the muscles of the heart have to work harder during exercise or when a person is under stress. {{#ev:youtube|GIWb4-a7A6A}}
245,Who is at highest risk for Chronic stable angina ?,"Certain risk factors make it more likely that you will develop coronary artery disease (CAD) and subsequently present with anginal pain.
Major risk factors for stable angina that you can control include:
Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Overweight and obesity Physical inactivity Diabetes (high blood sugar) Poor diet
Risk factors that you can't change include:
Age Family history of early coronary artery disease. Previous heart attack Having other diseases that affect the heart
Certain CAD risk factors tend to occur together. When they do, it’s called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person with metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone without metabolic syndrome."
246,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic stable angina ?,"You should seek medical care if you are experiencing:
New, unexplained chest pain, upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach Shortness of breath Nausea, vomiting Lightheadedness or fainting Breaking out in a cold sweat
If the symptoms mentioned above persists for more than 15 minutes even after resting or three doses of nitroglycerin or is worsening, call 911 immediately as these symptoms could be the signs of a heart attack (also called myocardial infarction or MI) because immediate treatment is essential.
{{#ev:youtube|U2DkFeBKkM8}}"
247,What to expect if I have Chronic stable angina  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Stable angina usually improves with lifestyle modifications and proper medication. {{#ev:youtube|O3jJ-s23G5M}}
248,What are the symptoms of Claudication?,"Symptoms of claudication may include:
Pain while engaging in rigorous activity. Pain may occur in: Buttocks Hips Thighs Calves Feet Arms Pain that is stop-and-go during moderately rigorous activity Weakness Aching or burning sensations Some men may experience impotence
For more severe cases of claudication, you may also experience:
Pain while sitting or lying down Extremities that are bluish in color, and may feel cold when you touch them Ulcerations or sores on your extremities or lower legs."
249,What causes Claudication?,"Claudication is typically caused by peripheral artery disease, a disease in which a person’s arteries in his limbs are damaged. The artery damage is usually caused by atherosclerosis.
Atheroschlerosis occurs when arteries become blocked by atherosclerotic plaque, which is usually made up of fat and cholesterol. This plaque causes arteries to become rigid and constricted, which can restrict the blood flow through them.
Since arteries carry oxygen to your muscles, this can be a serious problem. The pain from claudication occurs because not enough oxygen is reaching your muscles."
250,Who is at highest risk for Claudication ?,"People with the following characteristics are at higher risk for developing both claudication and atherosclerosis:
Smokers High blood pressure Body mass index over 30 (obesity) Total blood cholesterol over 240 mg/dL (6.2 mmol/L) Diabetes Age over 70 years Age over 50 years if you have diabetes or you smoke A family history of: Claudication Atherosclerosis Peripheral artery disease"
251,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Claudication ?,"If you have pain in your limbs when you exercise, see your doctor. Claudication and peripheral artery disease can be serious, and may affect your quality of life if they are not treated."
252,What to expect if I have Claudication  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With proper treatment, many people are able to stay active without experiencing pain. However, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent your condition from worsening."
253,Who is at highest risk for Commotio cordis ?,"Young athletes who are involved in sports such as baseball, soccer, ice hockey, polo, rugby, cricket, softball, pelota, fencing, lacrosse, boxing, karate, kung fu and other martial arts where there is a likelihood of sustaining blow to the chest."
254,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Commotio cordis ?,"9-1-1 should be contacted immediately when the athlete is found to be unresponsive, apneic, pulseless, and without an audible heartbeat. Emergent resuscitation is mandated by any person who is trained in CPR and AED (automated external defibrillator)."
255,What to expect if I have Commotio cordis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Commotio cordis has a poor prognosis with only about a quarter of these victims surviving after immediate resuscitation.
256,What are the symptoms of Congenital heart block?,Signs and symptoms depend on the type of heart block you have. First-degree heart block rarely causes symptoms. Symptoms of second- and third-degree heart block include: Fainting Dizziness or light-headedness Fatigue (tiredness) Shortness of breath Chest pain
257,What causes Congenital heart block?,"In pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.
These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects."
258,Who is at highest risk for Congenital heart block ?,"One form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells."
259,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital heart block ?,"The symptoms may suggest other health problems as well. If the symptoms mentioned above are new or severe,the patient need to visit hospital emergency room. For milder symptoms, talk with your doctor right away to find out whether the patient need prompt treatment."
260,What to expect if I have Congenital heart block  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Patients presenting as fetuses or at birth have significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates than do patients presenting later in childhood.
261,What are the symptoms of Congenital heart disease?,"Symptoms depend on the specific condition. While congenital heart disease is present at birth, the symptoms may not be immediately obvious for e.g. coarctation of the aorta may not cause problems for many years. Also, a small ventricular septal defect (VSD), may never cause any problems, and some people with a VSD have normal physical activity and a normal life span."
262,What causes Congenital heart disease?,"Congenital heart disease is often divided into two types: cyanotic (blue discoloration caused by a relative lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The common causes of congenital heart diseases are:
Cyanotic:
Tetralogy of Fallot Transposition of the great vessels Tricuspid atresia Total anomalous pulmonary venous return Truncus arteriosus Hypoplastic left heart Pulmonary atresia Some forms of total anomalous pulmonary venous return Ebstein's anomaly
Non-cyanotic:
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Atrial septal defect (ASD) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) Aortic stenosis Pulmonic stenosis Coarctation of the aorta Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect)
These problems may occur alone or together. The majority of congenital heart diseases occurs as an isolated defect and is not associated with other diseases. However, they can also be a part of various genetic and chromosomal syndromes such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and DiGeorge syndrome. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems."
263,Who is at highest risk for Congenital heart disease ?,"Individuals at an increased risk for congenital heart disease include:
People with a family history of congenital heart disease Babies born to mothers who: Drink during pregnancy Use recreational drugs Use certain prescriptions and over-the-counter medications dangerous to fetal development Fail to get proper prenatal care"
264,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital heart disease ?,Call your health care provider if you suspect that your child has a heart problem.
265,What to expect if I have Congenital heart disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,How well a patient does depends on the specific defect.
266,What are the symptoms of Congestive heart failure?,"Early cases of heart failure do not have any symptoms.
As the disease develops, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms: Ankle edema or swelling of the feet and legs Claudication or pain with walking Confusion and altered mentation Cool extremities or cold and clammy hands Cyanosis or bluish color to the skin Dizziness Dyspnea on ordinary exertion or greater shortness of breath with usual activities Fainting Fatigue Hemoptysis or frothy sputum Nocturia or urination during the night Nocturnal cough Orthopnea or sleeping on pillows Palpitations or extra heart beats Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or awakening at night with shortness of breath Shortness of breath Syncope or passing out Weakness Wheezing or cardiac asthma
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
267,What causes Congestive heart failure?,"Heart failure is a long-term (chronic) condition, but it can sometimes develop suddenly.
The condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. These are called right-sided heart failure or left-sided heart failure. More often, both sides of the heart are involved.
Heart failure is present when:
Your heart muscle cannot pump (eject) the blood out of the heart very well. This is called systolic heart failure.
Your heart muscles are stiff and do not fill up with blood easily. This is called diastolic heart failure.
Both of these problems mean the heart is no longer able to pump enough oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of your body, especially when you exercise or are active.
As the heart's pumping action is lost, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid builds up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure.
The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart.
Heart failure can also occur when an infection weakens the heart muscle. This condition is called cardiomyopathy.
Other heart problems that may cause heart failure are:
Congenital heart disease Heart attack Heart valve disease Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
Other diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:
Emphysema Overactive thyroid Severe anemia Underactive thyroid"
268,Who is at highest risk for Congestive heart failure ?,"Certain factors increase your risk of getting heart disease, then increase your risk of getting heart failure. You are at a higher risk if you are:
A woman aged 55 or older A man aged 45 or older Obesity or overweight Smoking High cholesterol High blood pressure Heavy drinking Diabetes Lack of exercise"
269,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congestive heart failure ?,"Patients with early heart failure can compensate. With the disease developing, the heart function decompensate and patients demonstrate a series of signs and symptoms. Call your health care provider if symptoms of heart failure develops. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Serious shortness of breath Patients can not lie in flat at night, even orthopnea. Hemoptysis or congh pink frothy sputum"
270,What to expect if I have Congestive heart failure  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of people with heart failure can vary dramatically. The following factors may help the doctor estimate the prognosis.
The severity of the symptoms: It is well established that patients who have more severe symptoms of heart failure do not survive as long as those who have mild symptoms. For example, patients with class IV heart failure have the poorest prognosis, while patients with class I have the best.
Heart function: The ejection fraction of left ventricle (LVEF) is an important indicator of the prognosis. The more severely damaged your heart muscle is, the worse your ejection fraction and worse prognosis will be, regardless of your symptoms.
The causes of heart failure: Heart failure associated with alcohol use or pregnancy may spontaneously recover itself over time. Heart failure can be caused by treatable conditions such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, anemia, or vitamin deficiency. The prognosis of these conditions are generally excellent. Heart failure as a result of a valve condition may also be reversible if the valve problem is recognized early and fixed before permanent damage happens. People with heart failure caused by severe hypertension may see considerable improvement of their symptoms when they control their hypertension. But the majority of patients have heart failure as a result of coronary artery disease (CAD) have a worse prognosis and a higher death rate than people who have heart failure that is not a result of CAD.
How long you've had heart failure: There is no specific length of time after which your heart function is unlikely to improve. General speaking, the longer you have had heart failure, the poorer prognosis may be even with appropriate treatment.
Compensatory factors: ""compensatory factors"" are various adjustments to correct the effects of heart failure on other organs. When heart failure occurs, various hormone levels including renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and prostaglandin, may increase. Increases in these hormonal factors and other compensatory factors often make heart failure worse over time."
271,What are the symptoms of constrictive pericarditis?,"Symptoms of constrictive pericarditis include:
Dyspnea - difficulty breathing that slowly develops and worsens Fatigue Edema - long term swelling of the legs and ankles due to exertion Swollen abdomen Weakness"
272,What causes constrictive pericarditis?,"Constrictive pericarditis can occur after any major pericardial disease that cause inflammation around the heart, such as:
Heart surgery (post-cardiac surgery) Radiation therapy to the chest area (post-radiation therapy, specifically after Hodgkin disease or breast cancer) Tuberculosis (postinfectious)
Constrictive pericarditis can also develop with no apparent cause."
273,Who is at highest risk for Constrictive pericarditis ?,Patients who have had heart surgery or any pericardial disease are at risk. This condition is most common among adults and is exceedingly rare in children.
274,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Constrictive pericarditis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.
275,What to expect if I have Constrictive pericarditis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If left untreated, constrictive pericarditis may become life threatening. Surgery is reserved for patients who have severe symptoms due to the high complication rate."
276,What are the symptoms of Cor pulmonale?,"Chest discomfort, usually in the front of the chest. Exercise intolerance. Shortness of breath. Swelling of the feet or ankles. Symptoms of underlying disorders (wheezing, coughing)."
277,What causes Cor pulmonale?,"Normally, the left side of the heart produces a higher blood pressure in order to pump blood to the body. The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs under much lower pressure.
Any condition that leads to prolonged high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (called pulmonary hypertension) puts a strain on the right side of the heart. When the right ventricle is unable to properly pump against these abnormally high pressures, it is called cor pulmonale.
Almost any chronic lung disease or condition causing prolonged low blood oxygen levels can lead to cor pulmonale. A few of these causes include:
Central sleep apnea Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease Cystic fibrosis Interstitial lung disease Kyphoscoliosis Obstructive sleep apnea Pneumoconiosis Primary pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary vascular disease Secondary pulmonary hypertension"
278,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cor pulmonale ?,Call your health care provider if you experience shortness of breath or chest pain.
279,What to expect if I have Cor pulmonale  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on the cause of the condition. Giving oxygen often improves symptoms, stamina, and survival.
Treating primary pulmonary hypertension often leads to greater stamina and a longer life. In some cases, a lung transplant or heart-lung transplant can extend survival."
280,What are the symptoms of cor triatriatum?,"Signs and symptoms depend upon the size of the opening in the septum and the manifestations of associated congenital cardiac defects. In most patients, the opening is severely restrictive and produces symptoms similar to those of severe mitral stenosis. Usual symptoms are the following:
Exertional dyspnea Cough Effort intolerance and easy fatigability Hemoptysis Orthopnea Palpitation Signs of systemic embolism
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
281,Who is at highest risk for Cor triatriatum ?,"Like many congenital heart disease, the cause of cor triatriatum is not clear. Clinical studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors may play a role during the pregnancy.
Viral infection Poor nutrition Genetic disorder"
282,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cor triatriatum ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of cor triatriatum develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Dyspnea Hemoptysis Palpitation"
283,What to expect if I have Cor triatriatum  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of cor triatriatum depends on whether the surgery has been done. The outcomes of infants or children, who are untreated with symptomatic cor triatriatum sinistrum associated with complex congenital cardiac defects, are very poor. On the contrary, adults with isolated cor triatriatum after surgery have good outcomes."
284,When could I drive after i underwent Coronary angioplasty discharge instructions ?,You should not drive for 48 hours after the procedure.
285,What medications should I take after Coronary angioplasty discharge instructions ?,"Aspirin every day - usually for the rest of your life. Ask your doctor about the dose you should take. Plavix (clopidogrel) and Effient (prasugrel) may be used in addition to Aspirin to decrease the risk of a blood clot forming in the heart artery.
You will be given a list of all medicines you should take once you are at home. Ask your doctor whether you should go back to taking the medications you were on before the procedure. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking."
286,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and do not take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
287,When may I resume my regular activities?,"You may resume your regular activities one week after the procedure. Avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than 10 pounds in the first week after the procedure. Also avoid any exercise that causes you to hold your breath and bear down with your abdominal muscles. Begin your exercise program one week after the procedure at half your usual routine, then gradually work back to your full routine. Please ask your doctor about your exercise instructions."
288,When could I bathe or swim?,"Usually after one week, when the puncture site is healed. This usually takes about a week. You may shower on the day after the procedure after removing the Band-Aid over your puncture site."
289,When can I go back to work after Coronary angioplasty discharge instructions ?,It depends on the type of your work. You can ask your doctor when you can go back to work.
290,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Coronary angioplasty discharge instructions ?,"Call your doctor if:
There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when you apply pressure. There is swelling at the catheter site. Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color, becomes cool to touch, or is numb. The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. Your pulse feels irregular -- very slow (fewer than 60 beats), or very fast (over 100 to 120 beats) a minute. You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. You have problems taking any of your heart medicines. You have chills or a fever over 101 °F."
291,Who needs coronary artery bypass grafting?,"Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is used to treat people who have severe coronary heart disease (CHD) that could lead to a heart attack. CABG also may be used to treat people who have heart damage following a heart attack but still have blocked arteries. Your doctor may recommend CABG if other treatments, such as lifestyle changes or medicines, haven't worked. He or she also may recommend CABG if you have severe blockages in the large coronary (heart) arteries that supply a major part of the heart muscle with blood—especially if your heart's pumping action has already been weakened.
CABG also may be a treatment option if you have blockages in the heart that can't be treated with angioplasty. Your doctor will decide whether you're a candidate for CABG based on a number of factors, including:
The presence and severity of CHD symptoms.
The severity and location of blockages in your coronary arteries.
Your response to other treatments.
Your quality of life.
Any other medical problems you have.
CABG may be done on an emergency basis, such as during a heart attack."
292,What to expect before coronary artery bypass grafting?,"Tests may be done to prepare you for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). For example, you may have blood tests, an EKG (electrocardiogram), echocardiography, a chest x ray, cardiac catheterization, and coronary angiography. Your doctor will give you specific instructions about how to prepare for surgery. He or she will advise you about what to eat or drink, what medicines to take, and what activities to stop (such as smoking). You'll likely be admitted to the hospital on the same day as the surgery. If tests for coronary heart disease show that you have severe blockages in your coronary (heart) arteries, your doctor may admit you to the hospital right away. You may have CABG that day or the day after."
293,What to expect during coronary artery bypass grafting?,"Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) requires a team of experts. A cardiothoracic surgeon does the surgery with support from an anesthesiologist, perfusionist (heart-lung bypass machine specialist), other surgeons, and nurses. There are several types of CABG. They range from traditional surgery in which the chest is opened to reach the heart, to nontraditional surgery in which small incisions (cuts) are made to bypass the blocked or narrowed artery.
This type of surgery usually lasts 3 to 5 hours, depending on the number of arteries being bypassed. Numerous steps take place during traditional CABG. You'll be under general anesthesia for the surgery. The term ""anesthesia"" refers to a loss of feeling and awareness. General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep. During the surgery, the anesthesiologist checks your heartbeat, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and breathing. A breathing tube is placed in your lungs through your throat. The tube is connected to a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe). An incision is made down the center of your chest. The chest bone is then cut and your ribcage is opened so that the surgeon can get to your heart. Medicines are used to stop your heart, which allows the surgeon to operate on it while it's not beating. You're also given medicines to protect your heart function during the time that it's not beating. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood moving throughout your body during the surgery. An artery or vein is taken from your body—for example, from your chest or leg—and prepared to be used as a graft for the bypass. In surgery with several bypasses, both artery and vein grafts are commonly used.
Artery grafts. These grafts are much less likely than vein grafts to become blocked over time. The left internal mammary artery most often is used for an artery graft. It's located inside the chest, close to the heart. Arteries from the arm or other places in the body are sometimes used as well.
Vein grafts. Although veins are commonly used as grafts, they're more likely than artery grafts to develop plaque and become blocked over time. The saphenous vein—a long vein running along the inner side of the leg—is typically used.
After the grafting is done, blood flow to your heart is restored. Usually, the heart starts beating again on its own. In some cases, mild electric shocks are used to restart the heart. You're then disconnected from the heart-lung bypass machine. Tubes are inserted into your chest to drain fluid. The surgeon uses wires to close your chest bone (much like how a broken bone is repaired). The wires stay in your body permanently. After your chest bone heals, it will be as strong as it was before the surgery. Stitches or staples are used to close the skin incision. The breathing tube is removed when you're able to breathe without it.
Nontraditional CABG includes off-pump CABG and minimally invasive CABG.
Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: This type of surgery can be used to bypass any of the coronary (heart) arteries. Off-pump CABG also is called beating heart bypass grafting because the heart isn't stopped and a heart-lung bypass machine isn't used. Instead, the part of the heart where grafting is being done is steadied with a mechanical device.
Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting: There are several types of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) grafting. These types of surgery differ from traditional bypass surgery. They only require small incisions rather than opening the chest bone to get to the heart. These procedures sometimes use a heart-lung bypass machine.
This procedure is done through small incisions (ports) made in your chest. Artery or vein grafts are used. A heart-lung bypass machine is used during this procedure.
This type of procedure allows for even smaller, keyhole-sized incisions. A small video camera is inserted in one incision to show the heart, while the surgeon uses remote-controlled surgical instruments to do the surgery. A heart-lung bypass machine is sometimes used during this procedure."
294,What are the risks of coronary artery bypass grafting?,"Although complications from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are uncommon, the risks include:
Wound infection and bleeding.
Reactions to anesthesia.
Fever.
Pain.
Stroke, heart attack, or even death.
Some patients develop a fever associated with chest pain, irritability, and decreased appetite. This is due to inflammation involving the lung and heart sac. This complication sometimes is seen 1 to 6 weeks after surgeries that involve cutting through the pericardium (the outer covering of the heart). This reaction usually is mild. However, some patients may develop fluid buildup around the heart that requires treatment. Memory loss and other changes, such as problems concentrating or thinking clearly, may occur in some people. These changes are more likely to occur in people who are older, who have high blood pressure or lung disease, or who drink excessive amounts of alcohol. These side effects often improve several months after surgery. Use of a heart-lung bypass machine increases the risk of blood clots forming in your blood vessels. Clots can travel to the brain or other parts of the body and block the flow of blood, which may cause a stroke or other problems. Recent technical improvements in heart-lung bypass machines are helping reduce the risk of blood clots forming. In general, the risk of complications is higher if CABG is done in an emergency situation (for example, during a heart attack), if you're older than 70, or if you have a history of smoking. Your risk also is higher if you have other diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, or peripheral arterial disease."
295,What to expect after coronary artery bypass grafting?,"After surgery, you'll typically spend 1 or 2 days in an Intensive care unit (ICU). Your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels will be checked regularly during this time. An intravenous line (IV) will likely be inserted into a vein in your arm. Through the IV line, you may get medicines to control blood circulation and blood pressure. You also will likely have a tube in your bladder to drain urine and a tube to drain fluid from your chest. You may receive oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs or a mask) and a temporary pacemaker while in the ICU. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. Your doctor may recommend that you wear compression stockings on your legs as well. These stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This creates gentle pressure up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting. While in the ICU, you'll also have bandages on your chest incision (cut) and on the areas where an artery or vein was removed for grafting. After you leave the ICU, you'll be moved to a less intensive care area of the hospital for 3 to 5 days before going home.
Your doctor will give you specific instructions for recovering at home, especially concerning:
How to care for your healing incisions.
How to recognize signs of infection or other complications.
When to call the doctor right away.
When to make followup appointments.
You also may get instructions on how to deal with common side effects from surgery. Side effects often go away within 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, but may include:
Discomfort or itching from healing incisions.
Swelling of the area where an artery or vein was removed for grafting.
Muscle pain or tightness in the shoulders and upper back.
Fatigue (tiredness), mood swings, or depression.
Problems sleeping or loss of appetite.
Constipation.
Chest pain around the site of the chest bone incision (more frequent with traditional CABG).
Full recovery from traditional CABG may take 6 to 12 weeks or more. Less recovery time is needed for nontraditional CABG. Your doctor will tell you when you can start physical activity again. It varies from person to person, but there are some typical timeframes. Most people can resume sexual activity within about 4 weeks and driving after 3 to 8 weeks. Returning to work after 6 weeks is common unless your job involves specific and demanding physical activity. Some people may need to find less physically demanding types of work or work a reduced schedule at first.
Care after surgery may include periodic checkups with doctors. During these visits, tests may be done to see how your heart is working. Tests may include EKG (electrocardiogram), stress testing, echocardiography, and cardiac CT. CABG is not a cure for coronary heart disease (CHD). You and your doctor may develop a treatment plan that includes lifestyle changes to help you stay healthy and reduce the chance of CHD getting worse. Lifestyle changes may include making changes to your diet, quitting smoking, doing physical activity regularly, and lowering and managing stress. Your doctor also may refer you to cardiac rehabilitation (rehab). Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that helps improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. Rehab programs include exercise training, education on heart healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress and help you return to an active life. Doctors supervise these programs, which may be offered in hospitals and other community facilities. Talk to your doctor about whether cardiac rehab might benefit you. Taking medicines as prescribed also is an important part of care after surgery. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to manage pain during recovery; lower cholesterol and blood pressure; reduce the risk of blood clots forming; manage diabetes; or treat depression."
296,What are the symptoms of Coronary heart disease?,"Symptoms may be very noticeable, but sometimes you can have the disease and not have any symptoms.
Chest pain or discomfort (angina) is the most common symptom. You feel this pain when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. How bad the pain is varies from person to person.
It may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You feel it under your breast bone (sternum), but also in your neck, arms, stomach, or upper back. The pain usually occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin.
Other symptoms include:
Shortness of breath Fatigue with activity (exertion).
Women, elderly people, and people with diabetes are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as:
Fatigue Shortness of breath Weakness"
297,What causes Coronary heart disease?,"Coronary heart disease is usually caused by a condition called atherosclerosis, which occurs when fatty material and other substances form a plaque build-up on the walls of your arteries. This causes them to get narrow. As the coronary arteries narrow, blood flow to the heart can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, heart attack, and other symptoms, usually when you are active.
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women."
298,Who is at risk for Coronary heart disease?,"Many things increase your risk for heart disease:
Men in their 40s have a higher risk of CHD than women. But as women get older (especially after they reach menopause), their risk increases to almost equal that of a man's risk.
Bad genes (heredity) can increase your risk. You are more likely to develop the condition if someone in your family has a history of heart disease -- especially if they had it before age 50. Your risk for CHD goes up the older you get.
Diabetes is a strong risk factor for heart disease.
High blood pressure increases your risks of coronary artery disease and heart failure.
Abnormal cholesterol levels: your LDL (""bad"") cholesterol should be as low as possible, and your HDL (""good"") cholesterol should be as high as possible to reduce your risk of CHD.
Metabolic syndrome refers to high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, excess body fat around the waist, and increased insulin levels. People with this group of problems have an increased chance of getting heart disease.
Smokers have a much higher risk of heart disease than nonsmokers.
Chronic kidney disease can increase your risk.
Already having atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries in another part of your body (examples are stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm) increases your risk of having coronary heart disease.
Other risk factors include alcohol abuse, not getting enough exercise, and having excessive amounts of stress.
Higher-than-normal levels of inflammation-related substances, such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen are being studied as possible indicators of an increased risk for heart disease.
Increased levels of a chemical called homocysteine, an amino acid, are also linked to an increased risk of a heart attack."
299,How to know you have a Coronary heart disease?,"Many tests help diagnose CHD. Usually, your doctor will order more than one test before making a definite diagnosis.
Tests may include:
Electrocardiogram (ECG) Exercise stress test Echocardiogram Magnetic resonance angiography Nuclear scan Electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) to look for calcium in the lining of the arteries: the more calcium, the higher your chance for CHD CT angiography -- a noninvasive way to perform coronary angiography Coronary angiography /arteriography -- an invasive procedure designed to evaluate the heart arteries under x-ray"
300,What Procedure to Choose?,"Although many indications are the same for performing either PCI or CABG, these two procedures have inherently different mechanisms.  While PCI mitigates an obstruction, it can not prevent plaque progression or rupture in other involved segments of the artery. On the contrary, CABG is able to prevent future ischemic insults caused by plaque progression or rupture in other involved segments of the artery. Most studies report the same outcome with PCI and CABG, but there are some reports that favor CABG over PCI: The SYNTAX trial with 705 patients demonstrated a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality rate among those who received PCI than the CABG cohort.  Two Studies reported that CABG is more effective in prevention of late spontaneous MI when compared to PCI.   ACA 2021 revascularization guideline recommends to consider the following factors to decide whether to chose PCI or CABG:  SYNTAX Score  SYNTAX score derived from a clinical trial with the same name which predicts the grade of the anatomic complexity and can be used as a decision-making tool. This score is a guide for selection of a revascularization procedure in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. All cause mortality rate among patients with a coronary artery disease -associated SYNTAX score equal or greater than 33 were significantly lower when undergone CABG than PCI For patients with SYNTAX score lower than 33, no differences have been report in mortality rate of CABG and PCI Compliance to medications Preferences of patient Individual factors, such as anatomic complexity, which is discussed in the following table: 


PCI would help patients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms for less than 12 hours.  Rescue PCI is recommended for STEMI patients who failed re-perfusion after fibrinolytic therapy to improve the survival.    PCI has been related to improved survival rate when done in STEMI patients who are stable and presented 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset.  Regardless of time from MI, PCI can increase survival in STEMI patients who developed complications such as ongoing ischemia, acute sever heart failure, or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.  Performing the PCI is not beneficial in stable and asymptomatic STEMI patients who have a totally occluded infarct artery >24 hours after symptom onset with no evidence for sever ischemia.  The role of PCI in asymptomatic STEMI patients who are presenting after 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset is not well studied.  However, based on a small trial named BRAVE-2 a reduction in left ventricular infarct size has been reported among asymptomatic STEMI patients who were treated with an invasive strategy of coronary stent within 12 to 48 hours after symptom onset, compared to conservative therapies.  Both PCI and CABG are indicated in patients with STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and hemodynamic instability.  CABG is recommended for patients with STEMI who have mechanical complications such as ventricular septal rupture, mitral regurgitation because of papillary muscle infarction or rupture, or free wall rupture.  Emergent or urgent CABG is recommended in STEMI patients whose PCI is not feasible with a large area of myocardial involvement. On the other hand, emergent or urgent CABG should be avoided in these patients in the absence of ischemia or large myocardial involvement. Furthermore, CABG is usually avoided if patients' distal targets are poor.   The following algorithm demonstrates the proper revascularization in STEMI patients. 


The sole condition that fibrinolytic therapies are superior to PCI is when the duration from hospital presentation to PCI is anticipated to be more than 120 minutes. An early revascularization strategy could increase the survival rate in patients with STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock.
Fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) are commonly used to assess the lesion significant. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) compares the maximal blood flow distal to the lesion to the normal maximal blood flow. On the other hand iFR compares the instantaneous wave-free ratio of the coronary pressure distal to the lesion during the diastole with the aortic pressure.  Reported in numbers of trials which used FFR, FFR -guided PCI was successful in lowering the revascularization rate, procedure-related chest pain in patients with stable coronary artery disease and functionally significant stenosis.    In one of these trials patients with abnormal FFR significantly benefited from PCI over medical therapy with lower rate of ischemia -driven revascularization and shorter procedural time.  FFR -guided revascularization with CABG was more off-pump with fewer anastomosis and simpler procedure compared to CABG with angiogram -guided revascularization in one of the clinical trials.    Although other studies reported similar outcomes in both.   iFR measure does not require the administration of adenosine has been also studied in clinical trials. Results supported that this measure is not inferior to FFR and also showed less adverse outcome related to the procedure.  Lower rate of long-term major adverse cardiac events has been reported when PCI was deferred with FFR greater than 0.80 or iFR that is >0.89. One of the trials named DEFER (Deferral of Percutaneous Intervention) reported that the rate of adverse outcome cardiac outcomes is similar in both group of patients whose PCI has been deferred either with a FFR greater than 0.75 or intermediate angiographic measures."
301,How a coronary risk profile performed?,"Blood is typically drawn from a vein, usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood. Next, the health care provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.
In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.
The blood is sent to a laboratory, where the following are measured:
Low density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol) High density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"" cholesterol) Total cholesterol Triglycerides Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL cholesterol, though this is often calculated from the triglyceride level) Other blood tests, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), may be added to the profile in some laboratories."
302,How to prepare for a coronary risk profile?,You should not eat or drink anything except water for 9 - 12 hours before having your blood drawn.
303,How will a coronary risk profile feel?,"When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing."
304,Why is a coronary risk profile performed?,"A coronary risk profile may be done:
To screen adults and children for high blood cholesterol and triglycerides To follow people who have had high cholesterol levels and are being treated
Screening for adults:
The first screening test is performed between ages 20 - 35 in men, and ages 20 - 45 in women. (Note: Different national medical organizations recommend different starting ages.)
Follow-up screening should be done every 5 years
Screening is done for anyone who develops diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or another illness caused by atherosclerosis.
Follow-up testing is done to determine how well diet and medications are controlling high cholesterol.
Screening for children is less agreed upon:
Some experts recommend only screening children with risk factors, such as a family history of high cholesterol or early heart disease (a history of heart attacks before age 55 in men, and before age 65 in women). Some experts recommend screening all children, but according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against cholesterol screening in children."
305,What are normal results?,"The ideal values are different for people without coronary artery disease or other risk factors than for those with known coronary artery disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure.
The desired values in adults are:
LDL: 70 - 130 mg/dL (lower numbers are desired) HDL: greater than 40 - 60 mg/dL (higher numbers are desired) Total cholesterol: less than 200 mg/dL (lower numbers are desired) Triglycerides: 10 - 150 mg/dL (lower numbers are desired) VLDL: 2 - 38 mg/dL
Talk to your health care provider about the ideal levels in children.
(Note: mg/dL = milligrams per deciliter)
(Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.)"
306,What do abnormal results mean?,"Abnormal values may be a sign that you are at increased risk for atherosclerosis and related disorders, including:
Heart disease Kidney disease Poor blood supply to the legs Stroke"
307,What are the risks?,"Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:
Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling light-headed Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)"
308,When could I drive after i underwent Coronary stent discharge instructions ?,You should not drive for 48 hours after the procedure.
309,What medications should I take after Coronary stent discharge instructions ?,"Aspirin every day - usually for the rest of your life. Ask your doctor about the dose you should take. Plavix (clopidogrel) and Effient (prasugrel) may be used in addition to Aspirin to decrease the risk of a blood clot forming in the heart artery.
You will be given a list of all medicines you should take once you are at home. Ask your doctor whether you should go back to taking the medications you were on before the procedure. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking."
310,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and do not take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
311,When may I resume my regular activities?,"You may resume your regular activities one week after the procedure. Avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than 10 pounds in the first week after the procedure. Also avoid any exercise that causes you to hold your breath and bear down with your abdominal muscles. Begin your exercise program one week after the procedure at half your usual routine, then gradually work back to your full routine. Please ask your doctor about your exercise instructions."
312,When could I bathe or swim?,"Usually after one week, when the puncture site is healed. This usually takes about a week. You may shower on the day after the procedure after removing the Band-Aid over your puncture site."
313,When can I go back to work after Coronary stent discharge instructions ?,It depends on the type of your work. You can ask your doctor when you can go back to work.
314,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Coronary stent discharge instructions ?,"Call your doctor if:
There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when you apply pressure. There is swelling at the catheter site. Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color, becomes cool to touch, or is numb. The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. Your pulse feels irregular -- very slow (fewer than 60 beats), or very fast (over 100 to 120 beats) a minute. You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. You have problems taking any of your heart medicines. You have chills or a fever over 101 °F."
315,What are the symptoms of Coronary vasospasm?,"Coronary vasospasm may be silent (without symptoms) or it may result in chest pain or angina. If the spasm lasts long enough, it may even cause a heart attack.
The main symptom is a type of chest pain called angina, which can be felt under the chest bone and is described as:
Constricting Crushing Pressure Squeezing Tightness
The pain:
Often occurs at rest May occur at the same time each day, usually between midnight and 8:00 AM Lasts from 5 to 30 minutes It is usually severe. The pain may spread to the neck, jaw, shoulder, or arm. The person may lose consciousness.
Unlike angina that is caused by hardening of the coronary arteries, chest pain and shortness of breath are often not present when you walk or exercise."
316,What causes Coronary vasospasm?,"The spasm often occurs in coronary arteries that have not become hardened due to plaque buildup (atherosclerosis). However, it also can occur in arteries with plaque buildup.
A contraction (squeezing) of muscles in the artery wall causes these spasms in the arteries. The contraction occurs in just one area of the artery. The coronary artery may appear normal during angiography, but it does not function normally."
317,Who is at highest risk for Coronary vasospasm ?,"Coronary vasospasm affects approximately 4 out of 100,000 people. About 2% of patients with angina have coronary vasospasm.
Coronary vasospasm occurs most commonly in people who smoke or who have high cholesterol or high blood pressure.
In many people, coronary vasospasm may occur without any other heart risk factors and it may be triggered by:
Alcohol withdrawal, Emotional stress, Exposure to cold, Medications that cause narrowing of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction), Stimulant drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine."
318,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Coronary vasospasm ?,"Immediately call- 911 or go to the hospital emergency room if you have a history of angina and the crushing or squeezing chest pain is not relieved by nitroglycerin. The pain may be due to a heart attack. Rest and nitroglycerin do not completely relieve the pain of a heart attack.
A heart attack is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, seek immediate medical help."
319,What are the symptoms of Deep vein thrombosis?,Changes in skin color (redness) in one leg Increased warmth in one leg Leg pain in one leg Leg tenderness in one leg Skin that feels warm to the touch Swelling (edema) of one leg
320,What causes Deep vein thrombosis?,"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) mainly affects the large veins in the lower leg and thigh. The clot can block blood flow and cause swelling and pain. When a clot breaks off and moves through the bloodstream, this is called an embolism. An embolism can get stuck in the brain, lungs, heart or another other area that can lead to severe damage.
Blood clots may form when something causes the flow of blood in the veins to slow or change.
{{#ev:youtube|CETfozL0cQg}}"
321,Who is at highest risk for Deep vein thrombosis ?,"DVTs are most common in adults over age 60, but can occur at any age.
Sitting for long periods when traveling can increase the risk of DVTs. This is most likely when one or more of the risk factors listed below are also present. Risk factors include:
After a pacemaker catheter has been passed through the vein in the groin Bedrest Cigarette smoking Family history of blood clots Fractures in the pelvis or legs Giving birth within the last 6 months Heart failure Obesity Recent surgery (especially hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery) Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow (polycythemia vera), causing the blood to be thicker and slower than normal
You're also more likely to develop DVT if you have any of the following conditions:
Blood that is more likely to clot (hypercoagulability) Cancer Taking estrogens or birth control pills. This risk is even higher if you smoke."
322,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Deep vein thrombosis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of DVT.
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have DVT and you develop chest pain, difficulty breathing, coughing blood, fainting, loss of consciousness, or other severe symptoms."
323,What to expect if I have Deep vein thrombosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many DVTs disappear without a problem, but they can return. Some people may have long-term pain and swelling in the leg known as post-phlebitic syndrome. Wearing tight (compression) stockings during and after the DVT may help prevent this problem.
Blood clots in the thigh are more likely to break off and cause pulmonary embolism (PE) than blood clots in the lower leg or other parts of the body."
324,What are the symptoms of Dengue fever?,"Dengue fever begins with a sudden high fever, often as high as 104–105 degrees Fahrenheit. A flat, red rash may appear over most of the body 2–5 days after the fever starts. A second rash, which looks like the measles, appears later in the disease. Infected people may have increased skin sensitivity and are very uncomfortable.
Other symptoms include:
Headache (especially behind the eyes) Fatigue Joint aches Muscle aches Nausea Swollen lymph nodes Vomiting"
325,What causes Dengue fever?,"Dengue fever is caused by one of four different but related viruses. It is spread by the bite of mosquitoes, most commonly the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is found in tropic and subtropic regions. This includes parts of:
Indonesian archipelago into northeastern Australia South and Central America Southeast Asia Sub-Saharan Africa
Dengue fever is being seen more in world travelers.
Dengue fever should not be confused with dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is a separate disease that is caused by the same type of virus but has much more severe symptoms."
326,Who is at highest risk for Dengue fever ?,"Living or traveling to a region of the world where the infection is endemic is a risk factor for the disease. These regions include:
Indonesian archipelago into northeastern Australia South and Central America Southeast Asia Sub-Saharan Africa
The presence of water-holding containers in and around the home needed for the mosquito's to complete their development sustains the reservoir for disease and is a risk factor. Risk factors for severe disease include being a neonate or young child, female sex, high body mass index, a high viral load, genetic polymorphisms and previous infection with DENV-1 if the patient contracts the DENV-2 or DENV-3 strain. Diabetes and asthma are risk factors for fatal disease."
327,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dengue fever ?,Call your health care provider if you have traveled in an area where dengue fever is known to occur and have developed symptoms of the disease.
328,What to expect if I have Dengue fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The condition generally lasts a week or more. Although uncomfortable, dengue fever in most cases is not deadly. People with the condition should fully recover. Some people develop a more severe form of the disease which requires hospitalization."
329,What are the symptoms of Dextrocardia?,"There are no symptoms of dextrocardia if the heart is normal.
Conditions that may include dextrocardia may cause the following symptoms:
Bluish skin Difficulty breathing Failure to grow and gain weight Fatigue Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes) Pale skin (pallor) Repeated sinus or lung infections"
330,What causes Dextrocardia?,"During the early weeks of pregnancy, the baby's heart develops. Sometimes, for reasons that are unclear, the heart develops and turns so that it points to the right side of the chest instead of the left side. There are several types of dextrocardia. Most involve other defects of the heart and abdomen area. The simplest type of dextrocardia is one in which the heart is a mirror image of the normal heart, and no other problems exist. This condition is rare. Usually in this case, the organs of the abdomen and the lungs will also be arranged in a mirror image of their normal position. For example, the liver will be on the left side instead of the right. Some people with mirror-image dextrocardia have a problem with the fine hairs (cilia) that filter the air going into their nose and air passages. This condition is called Kartagener syndrome. In the more common types of dextrocardia, heart defects are present in addition to the abnormal location of the heart. The most common heart defects seen with dextrocardia include:
Double outlet right ventricle Endocardial cushion defect Pulmonary stenosis or atresia Single ventricle Transposition of the great vessels Ventricular septal defect
The abdominal and chest organs in babies with dextrocardia may be abnormal and may not work correctly. A very serious syndrome that appears with dextrocardia is called heterotaxy. Heterotaxy means the organs (atria of the heart and abdominal organs) are not in their usual places. In heterotaxy, the spleen may be completely missing. Because the spleen is an extremely important part of the immune system, babies born without a spleen are in danger of severe bacterial infections and death. In another form of heterotaxy several small spleens exist, but may not work correctly. Heterotaxy may also include:
Abnormal gallbladder system Problems with the lungs Problems with the structure of the intestines Severe heart defects
Possible risk factors for dextrocardia include:
Family history of the condition Mother with diabetes (may play a role in some forms of dextrocardia)"
331,Who is at highest risk for Dextrocardia ?,"Like most congenital heart defects, it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with dextocardia. There is evidence to suggest that families with a history of genetic problems and other congenital heart disease may be at an increased risk for carrying and expressing the trait. Genetic testing may be performed to assist you in estimating the likelihood that any future children may be born with dextrocardia.
Expectant mothers who consume alcohol and illicit drugs during pregnancy are putting their fetus at an increased risk for a congenital heart disease, such as dextrocardia."
332,What to expect if I have Dextrocardia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Babies with simple dextrocardia have a normal life expectancy and should have no problems related to the location of the heart. When dextrocardia appears with other defects in the heart and elsewhere in the body, how well the baby does depends on the severity of the problems. The death rate in babies and children without a spleen may be high due to infections. This is at least partially preventable with daily antibiotics."
333,What are the symptoms of Diffuse esophageal spasm?,"Difficulty swallowing or pain with swallowing Pain in the chest or upper abdomen
It can be hard to tell a spasm from angina pectoris, a symptom of heart disease. The pain may spread to the neck, jaw, arms, or back"
334,What causes Diffuse esophageal spasm?,The cause of diffuse esophageal spasm is unknown. Very hot or very cold foods may trigger an episode in some people.
335,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diffuse esophageal spasm ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of diffuse esophageal spasm that don't go away.
336,What to expect if I have Diffuse esophageal spasm  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,A diffuse esophageal spasm may come and go (intermittent) or last for a long time (chronic). Medicine can help relieve symptoms.
337,What are the symptoms of Dilated Cardiomyopathy?,"Symptoms of heart failure are most common. Usually, they develop slowly over time. However, sometimes symptoms start very suddenly and are severe.
Common symptoms are:
Chest pain or pressure (more likely when you exercise) Cough Fatigue, weakness, faintness Irregular or rapid pulse Loss of appetite Shortness of breath with activity or after lying down (or being asleep) for a while Swelling of feet and ankles (in adults)"
338,What causes Dilated Cardiomyopathy?,"Heart disease (which is caused by a narrowing of the arteries) and poorly controlled high blood pressure are the most common causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. These problems lead to a weakened and enlarged heart muscle.
There are many other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, including:
Alcohol or cocaine abuse, or medicines that can be toxic to the heart (such as drugs used to treat cancer) Abnormal heart rhythms in which the heart beats very fast for a long period of time Autoimmune illnesses, when the immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake Conditions that run in families Infections that involve the heart muscle Heart valves that are either too narrow or too leaky (regurgitant) Trace elements, such as lead, arsenic, or mercury
This condition can affect anyone at any age. However, it is most common in adult men."
339,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dilated cardiomyopathy ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of cardiomyopathy.
If chest pain, palpitations, or faintness develop seek emergency medical treatment immediately."
340,What to expect if I have Dilated cardiomyopathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Heart failure is most often a chronic illness, which may get worse over time. Some people develop severe heart failure, in which medicines, other treatments, and surgery no longer help. Many people are at risk for deadly heart rhythms, and may need medicines or a defibrillator."
341,What are the symptoms of Disseminated intravascular coagulation ?,"Bleeding, possibly from multiple sites in the body Blood clots Bruising Drop in blood pressure"
342,What are the causes of Disseminated intravascular coagulation ?,"Normally when you are injured, certain proteins in the blood become activated and travel to the injury site to help stop bleeding. However, in persons with DIC, these proteins become abnormally active. This often occurs due to inflammation, infection, or cancer.
Small blood clots form in the blood vessels. Some of these clots can clog up the vessels and cut off blood supply to various organs such as the liver, brain, or kidney. These organs will then be damaged and may stop functioning.
Over time, the clotting proteins are consumed or used up. When this happens, the person is then at risk for serious bleeding, even from a minor injury or without injury. This process may also break up healthy red blood cells."
343,Who is at highest risk for Disseminated intravascular coagulation ?,"Risk factors for DIC include:
Blood transfusion reaction Cancer, especially certain types of leukemia Infection in the blood by bacteria or fungus Liver disease Pregnancy complications (such as placenta that is left behind after delivery) Recent surgery or anesthesia Sepsis (a serious infection) Severe tissue injury (as in burns and head injury)"
344,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Disseminated intravascular coagulation ?,Go to the emergency room or call 911 if you have bleeding that won't stop.
345,What to expect if I have Disseminated intravascular coagulation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on what is causing the disorder, but DIC can be life-threatening."
346,What are the symptoms of Dressler's syndrome?,"Anxiety Chest pain May come and go (recur) Pain may be sharp and stabbing (pleuritic) or tight and crushing (ischemic) Pain may get worse when breathing and may go away when you stand or sit up Pain moves to the neck, shoulder, back, or abdomen Difficulty breathing Dry cough Fast heart rate (tachycardia) Fatigue Fever (more common with the second type of pericarditis) Malaise (general ill feeling) Splinting of ribs (bending over or holding the chest) with deep breathing"
347,What causes Dressler's syndrome?,"Two types of pericarditis can occur after a heart attack. The first type of pericarditis most often occurs within 2 to 5 days after a heart attack. When the body tries to clean up the diseased heart tissue, swelling and inflammation occur. The second type of pericarditis is also called Dressler's syndrome (or post-cardiac injury syndrome or postcardiotomy pericarditis). It occurs several weeks or months after a heart attack, heart surgery, or other trauma to the heart. Dressler's syndrome is believed to be caused by the immune system attacking the area. Pain occurs when the pericardium becomes inflamed (swollen) and rubs on the heart."
348,Who is at highest risk for Dressler%27s syndrome ?,"You have a higher risk of pericarditis if you have had a previous heart attack, open heart surgery, or chest trauma, or if your heat attack affected the thickness of your heart muscle."
349,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dressler%27s syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of pericarditis after a heart attack You have been diagnosed with pericarditis and symptoms continue or come back, despite treatment"
350,What to expect if I have Dressler%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The condition may come back, even in people who receive treatment. In some cases, untreated pericarditis can be life threatening."
351,What causes Dyspnea?,"Shortness of breath has many different causes:
A blockage of the air passages in your nose, mouth, or throat may lead to difficulty breathing. Heart disease can cause breathlessness if your heart is unable to pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body. If your brain, muscles, or other body organs do not receive enough oxygen, a sense of breathlessness may occur. Lung disease can cause breathlessness. Sometimes emotional distress, such as anxiety, can lead to difficulty breathing.
The following problems may cause breathing difficulty:
Problems with the lungs: Blood clot in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary embolism) Bronchiolitis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and other chronic lung problems Pneumonia Pulmonary hypertension
Problems with the airways leading to the lungs: Choking on something stuck in the airways Croup Epiglottitis
Problems with the heart: Heart attack or angina Heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease) Heart failure Heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias)
Other problems: Allergies (such as to mold, dander, or pollen) Climbing to high altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air Compression of the chest wall Dust in the environment Hiatal hernia Obesity Panic attacks"
352,What are the symptoms of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve?,"Symptoms of Ebstein's anomaly develop after birth and include bluish-colored lips and nails due to low blood oxygen levels. Symptoms range from mild to severe. In severe cases, the baby appears very sick and has trouble breathing. However in older children symptoms are mild, and include:
Cough Failure to grow Fatigue Rapid breathing Shortness of breath Very fast heartbeat"
353,What are the causes of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve?,"The exact cause of Ebstein's anomaly is unknown, however the use of certain drugs (such as lithium or benzodiazepines) during pregnancy may play a role. Ebstein's anomaly occurs as a baby develops in the womb. This condition is rare but it is more common among Caucasians. The tricuspid valve is made up of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. These leaflets or flaps allow blood to flow from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. The leaflets close to prevent blood from flowing from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps.The leaflets are unusually deep in the right ventricle and are often larger than normal in cases of Ebstein's anomaly. Due to the defect, blood may go the wrong way back into the right atrium, when it should be flowing to the right ventricle. When the blood gets backed up it can lead to heart swelling and fluid buildup in the lungs or liver. Sometimes, blood can't get out of the heart into the lungs and the person may appear blue. However in most cases of Ebstein's anomaly, patients have a hole in the wall which separates the heart's two upper chambers and the blood may flow across the hole. This may cause oxygen -poor blood to go to the rest of the body. There may also be narrowing of the valve that leads to the lungs (pulmonary valve)."
354,Who is at highest risk for Ebsteins anomaly of the tricuspid valve ?,"Since the exact cause of Ebstein's anomaly is unknown, it is difficult to distinguish who is at risk. However, the use of certain drugs (such as lithium or benzodiazepines) during pregnancy may play a role. Even though this condition is very rare, it is more common among Caucasians."
355,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ebsteins anomaly of the tricuspid valve ?,Call your health care provider if your child develops symptoms of this condition. Seek immediate medical attention if breathing problems occur.
356,What are the symptoms of Eisenmenger's syndrome?,"Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) Bluish lips, fingers, toes, and skin (cyanosis) Chest pain Coughing up blood Dizziness Fainting Feeling tired Shortness of breath Stroke Swelling in the joints caused by too much uric acid (gout)"
357,What causes Eisenmenger's syndrome?,"Eisenmenger syndrome is caused by a defect in the heart. Most often, babies with this condition are born with a hole between the two pumping chambers -- the left and right ventricles -- of the heart (ventricular septal defect). The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body. Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include:
Atrioventricular canal defect Atrial septal defect Cyanotic heart disease Patent ductus arteriosus Truncus arteriosus
Over time, increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood backs up and does not go to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Instead, the blood goes from the right side to the left side of the heart, allowing oxygen-poor blood to travel to the rest of the body. Eisenmenger syndrome usually develops before a child reaches puberty. However, it also can develop in young adulthood."
358,Who is at highest risk for Eisenmenger%27s syndrome ?,"Like most congenital heart defects, it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with Eisenmenger's syndrome. There is evidence to suggest that families with a history of genetic problems and other congenital heart disease may be at an increased risk for carrying and expressing the trait. Genetic testing may be performed to assist you in estimating the likelihood that any future children may be born with Eisenmenger's syndrome.
During pregnancy, expectant mothers exposed to rubella may have an increased risk in having a baby with a heart defect. Drug and alcohol exposure during pregnancy can also harm the fetus during development and result in potential birth defects."
359,What to expect if I have Eisenmenger%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well the infant or child does depends on whether another medical condition is present, and the age at which high blood pressure develops in the lungs. Patients with this condition can live 20 to 50 years."
360,How do I begin to read an ECG?,A short ECG recording of normal heart rhythm (sinus rhythm) An example of a normal ECG. Click on the Image for an enlargement
361,Where do you start when interpreting an ECG?,"on the top left are the patient's information, name, sex and date of birth at the right of that are below each other the Frequency, the conduction times (PQ,QRS,QT/QTc), and the heart axis (P-top axis, QRS axis and T-top axis) further to the right is the interpretation of the ECG written (this often misses in a'fresh' ECG, but later the interpretation of the cardiologist or computer will be added) down left is the'paper speed' (25 mm/s on the horizontal axis), the sensitivity (10mm/mV) and the filter's frequency (40Hz, filters noise from eg. lights) finally there is a calibration on the ECG, on the beginning of every lead is a vertical block that shows with what amplitude a 1 mV signal is drawn. So the height and depth of these signals are a measurement for the voltage. If this is not the set at 10 mm, there is something wrong with the machine setting. further we have the ECG leads themselves of course, these will be discussed below.
Note that the lay-out is different for every machine, but most machines will show the information above somewhere."
362,What does the ECG register?,"The ECG is a registration of the heart's electric activity.
Just like skeletal muscles, the heart is electrically stimulated to contract. This stimulation is also called activation or excitation. Cardiac muscles are electrically charged at rest. The inside of the cell is negatively charged relative to the outside (resting potential). If the cardiac muscle cells are electrically stimulated they depolarize (the resting potential changes from negative to positive) and contract.
As the impulse spreads through the heart, the electric field changes continually in size and direction. The ECG is a graphical visualization of these electric signals in the heart.
Normal sinus rhythm"
363,When could I drive after i underwent Electrophysiology study and ablation discharge instructions ?,You should not drive after the procedure without asking your doctor when you could do that. This is different for everyone.
364,What medications should I take after Electrophysiology study and ablation discharge instructions ?,Ask your doctor whether you should go back to taking the medications you were on before the procedure. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking.
365,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and do not take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
366,When may I resume my regular activities?,"You may resume your regular activities one week after the procedure. Avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than 10 pounds in the first week after the procedure. Also avoid any exercise that causes you to hold your breath and bear down with your abdominal muscles. Begin your exercise program one week after the procedure at half your usual routine, then gradually work back to your full routine. Please ask your doctor about your exercise instructions."
367,When can I go back to work after Electrophysiology study and ablation discharge instructions ?,It depends on the type of your work. You can ask your doctor when you can go back to work.
368,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Electrophysiology study and ablation discharge instructions ?,"Call your doctor if:
Your wound looks infected (redness, increased drainage, swelling, painful). You feel dizzy or short of breath. You have chest pain. You have hiccups that do not go away. You were unconscious for a moment."
369,What are the symptoms of Endocarditis ?,"Symptoms of endocarditis may develop slowly (subacute) or suddenly (acute). Fever is the classic symptom and may persist for days before any other symptoms appear.
Other symptoms may include:
Abnormal urine color Blood in the urine Chills Excessive sweating Fatigue Joint pain Muscle aches and pains Nail abnormalities (splinter hemorrhages under the nails) Night sweats (may be severe) Paleness Red, painless skin spots on the palms and soles (Janeway lesions) Red, painful nodes in the pads of the fingers and toes (Osler's nodes) Shortness of breath with activity Swelling of the feet, legs, abdomen Weakness Weight loss"
370,What are the causes of Endocarditis ?,"Endocarditis is usually a result of a blood infection. Bacteria or other infectious substance can enter the bloodstream during certain medical procedures, including dental procedures, and travel to the heart, where it can settle on damaged heart valves. The bacteria can grow and may form infected clots that break off and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys, or spleen. Most people who develop infectious endocarditis have underlying heart disease or valve problems. However, an organism commonly found in the mouth, Streptococcus viridans, is responsible for about 50% of all bacterial endocarditis cases. This is why dental procedures increase your chances for developing this condition. Such procedures are especially risky for children with congenital heart conditions. As a result, it is common practice for children with some forms of congenital heart disease and adults with certain heart-valve conditions to take antibiotics before any dental work. Other common culprits include Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus. Staphylococcus aureus can infect normal heart valves, and is the most common cause of infectious endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Less common causes of infectious endocarditis include pseudomonas, serratia, and candida."
371,Who is at highest risk for Endocarditis ?,"The following increase your chances for developing endocarditis:
Artificial heart valves Congenital heart disease (atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and others) Heart valve problems (such as mitral insufficiency) History of rheumatic heart disease Intravenous drug users are also at risk for this condition, because unsterile needles can cause bacteria to enter the bloodstream."
372,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Endocarditis ?,"Call your health care provider if you note the following symptoms during or after treatment:
Weight loss without change in diet Blood in urine Chest pain Weakness Numbness or weakness of muscles Fever"
373,What to expect if I have Endocarditis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Early treatment of bacterial endocarditis generally has a good outcome. Heart valves may be damaged if diagnosis and treatment are delayed.
374,What are the costs of dabigatran and warfarin?,"The annual cost of therapy with Dabigatran are estimated to be $2,884 per patient.
The cost of Warfarin is approximately $0.30 per day, $109.5 per year.
(http://www.pharmacychecker.com/Pricing.asp?DrugName=Warfarin&DrugId=19462&DrugStrengthId=31721)
There is a cost associated with INR monitoring of Warfarin of $2,134 per year in the first year (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/8/6/) which drops to $1,170 in the second year once the patient is at a more stable level of anticoagulation. Let’s assume an average cost of $1,652 per year. The cost of Warfarin and its monitoring is therefore $1,761 per year.
Thus, the incremental drug acquisition and monitoring costs of DabigatranDabigatran over Warfarin would be $2,884 - $1,761 per year or $1,123 per year."
375,How many patients would you need to treat to save a life?,"Given the 0.5% mortality reduction (which was of borderline statistical significance for the 150 mg dose), you would need to treat 200 patients for one year to save one life."
376,How much would it cost to save that life?,"That one year of therapy in 200 patients would cost an additional 200 X $1,123 or $224,600."
377,How long does someone with atrial fibrillation live after you save their life?,"The average age of patients in RE-LYwas 71.4 years. The average years of life a female can expect to live beyond 71 years is 14 years and a male is 13 years:
(http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/births_deaths_marriages_divorces/life_expectancy.html).
Patients who have atrial fibrillation may live less than the usual 13.5 years for a 71 year old. The survival of an atrial fibrillation patient may depend upon co-morbidities. Although post CABG atrial fibrillation may have a limited impact on survival, some conditions such as systolic heart failure that are associated with atrial fibrillation are associated with a 1.9 fold higher risk of dying.
Given that the risk of dying is doubled in these patients, let’s assume that the survival of a 71-year old atrial fibrillation patient is cut in half to 6.75 years. Using this number will yield a conservative estimate of cost effectiveness."
378,What is the cost per year of life saved with dabigatran?,"Therefore, $224,600 in societal costs divided by those 6.75 years the person whose life was saved goes on to live equates to $33,274 per year of life saved. This is well within the acceptable limits for cost per year of life saved in the United States and similar to the cost per year of life saved for a defibrillator."
379,What if you factor in the reduction in costly strokes and the reduction in costs due to a reduction in bleeding?,"If complications of pharmacotherapy are included in the cost effectiveness analysis, the cost effectiveness of dabigatran may be even more favorable.
The lifetime cost of all cause stroke is estimated by the CDC to be $100,000. The rate of stroke per year was 1.57% for Warfarin and 1.01% for 150 mg of dabigatran. Therefore, there is a 0.56% lower rate of stroke per year. In our population of 200 patients, there would be expected to be 1.12 fewer strokes. If each stroke costs $100,000 over the lifetime of the patient then preventing 1.12 fewer cases with dabigatran would save $112,000.
In addition to the small but statistically significant reduction in mortality associated with Dabigatran therapy, there were also numerically (but not statistically significantly) fewer major bleeds (3.4% vs 3.1% per year). The cost of a major bleed is estimated to be $8000 (personal communication, Dr. David Cohen). The cost of treating 200 patients with dabigatran would be reduced slightly by 0.6 bleeds or $4,800 dollars.
There was an increased risk of MI of 0.21% (p=0.048) for dabigatran vs Warfarin (0.74% - 0.53%/year). The cost of a significant q wave MI is $7000 (Source: Dr. David Cohen). Treatment of the 200 patients with dabigatran would yield 0.4 of an MI at an increased cost of $2800.
Treating 200 patients with dabigatran for a year costs an additional $224,600 over Warfarin. Among 200 treated patients, there is a cost reduction of $112,000 due to 1.12 fewer stroke cases with dabigatran. Among these 200 treated patients, there is a cost reduction of $4,800 due to 0.6 fewer major bleeds. There is also a cost increase of $2,800 among these 200 treated patients due to 0.4 MI cases. The total additional cost of dabigatran treatment inclusive of complications in 200 patients is $110,600. The cost per year of life saved assuming 6.75 years of survival could therefore be as low as $16,385.
If society views $50,000 / year of life saved as cost effective, and' if it costs society $110,600 to save that life when the costs of complications are factored in, then' the survival of atrial fibrillation patients must only exceed 2.2 years for the therapy to be cost effective. (Spending $110,600 to save a life of someone who lives 2.2. years equates to $50,000 per year of life saved.) Most 71 year old atrial fibrillation patients survive more than 2.2 years."
380,What does it cost to prevent a stroke?,"There was a reduction in all cause stroke from 1.57% / year for Warfarin to 1.01% / year for dabigatran, a 0.56% / year reduction. You would need to treat 179 patients with dabigatran to prevent one stroke. This would incur an incremental cost of 179 x $1,123, or $200,535. On the other hand, the lifetime cost of all cause stroke is estimated by the CDC to be $100,000. The net total cost would therefore be $100,535. Patients with stroke have a 2.3 fold higher mortality, so survival was estimated to be 13.5 / 2.3 = 5.8 years. That’s $17,333 per year of stroke-free life saved."
381,What are the limitations of a cost-effectiveness analysis like this?,"These estimates are driven by “point estimates” A 0.5% improvement in mortality is small, and this point estimate may be unstable (p=0.051). Patients with atrial fibrillation may live longer than the 6.75 years assumed here. A longer survival time would reduce the cost per year of life saved.
No quality adjusted life expectancy data is presented. These data mix present cost with future costs. Some cost estimates are old. There may be heterogeneity in costs of stroke, bleeding and MI throughout the world."
382,How do these costs fit in with what we spend on other things in society?,"Last year, in TIME magazine, Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence stated the following (http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888006,00.html#ixzz13Z0tUMuG):
“ Our Department of Transport, for instance, has a cost-per-life-saved threshold for new road schemes of about 1.5 million GBP per life, or around 30,000 GBP per life year gained. The judgment of our health economists is that somewhere in the region of 20,000-30,000 GBP per quality-adjusted life year is the threshold, but it's not a strict limit. “
This would convert to 1.58 X 20,000 GBP = $31,600 USD to $47,400 USD. Thus, $16,000 to $33,000per year of life saved would fall within or even below this range.
While estimates of what governments are willing to pay for are generally about $50,000 per year of life saved, hemodialysis costs approximately $129,000 per year of life saved. (http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html)"
383,What causes Fatigue?,"There are many possible causes of fatigue, including:
Anemia (including iron deficiency anemia) Depression or grief Medications such as sedatives or antidepressants Persistent pain Sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, or narcolepsy Thyroid gland that is underactive or overactive Use of alcohol or drugs such as cocaine or narcotics, especially with regular use
Fatigue can also occur with the following illnesses:
Addison's disease Anorexia or other eating disorders Arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosis Cancer Congestive heart failure Diabetes Fibromyalgia Infection, especially one that takes a long time to recover from or treat, such as bacterial endocarditis (infection of the heart muscle or valves), parasitic infections, AIDS, tuberculosis, and mononucleosis Kidney disease Liver disease Malnutrition
Certain medications may also cause drowsiness or fatigue, including antihistamines for allergies, blood pressure medicines, sleeping pills, steroids, and diuretics.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition that starts with flu-like symptoms and lasts for 6 months or more. It is diagnosed after all other possible causes of fatigue are ruled out. Most people with CFS do not get much relief from rest."
384,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Fatigue ?,"Call your doctor right away if:
You are confused or dizzy You have blurred vision You have little to no urine, or recent swelling and weight gain
Call your doctor if:
You have unexplained weakness or fatigue, especially if you also have a fever or unintentional weight loss You have constipation, dry skin, weight gain, or you cannot tolerate cold You wake up and fall back to sleep many times during the night You have headaches You are taking any medications, prescription or non-prescription, or using drugs that may cause fatigue or drowsiness You feel sad or depressed You have insomnia"
385,What are the symptoms of Fibromuscular dysplasia?,"Some patients experience no symptoms of the disease while others may have
High blood pressure Dizziness or vertigo Chronic headache Intracranial aneurysm Ringing in the ears Weakness or numbness in the face Neck pain Changes in vision"
386,What causes Fibromuscular dysplasia?,"While the cause of fibromuscular dysplasia is unknown, it's believed that several factors may play a role.
Genetics. Genetics may play a role in the development of fibromuscular dysplasia. But, if another family member has fibromuscular dysplasia, you or a relative may never get fibromuscular dysplasia, or you might get the condition in a different artery or have a milder case or a more severe case than your family member's fibromuscular dysplasia. In addition, not everyone who has fibromuscular dysplasia has a relative with the disease. Hormones. premenopausal women have this disease more often than men do. Abnormally formed arteries"
387,Who is at highest risk for Fibromuscular dysplasia ?,"These factors increases the risk for the patients
Sex. Women have a much greater risk than men. Age. more common in people from 25 to 50 years old. Smoking appear to have an increased risk of developing fibromuscular dysplasia. For those already diagnosed with the disease, smoking increases further risk."
388,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Fibromuscular dysplasia ?,If you are young female and develop any of the above mentioned symptoms then you should call or visit a health care professional.
389,What to expect if I have Fibromuscular dysplasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After the diagnosis have been made, a repeat Doppler ultrasound exam or a CT angiogram is done every six to 12 months to see the prognosis."
390,What are the symptoms of Gonorrhea?,"Symptoms of gonorrhea usually appear 2 - 5 days after infection, however, in men, symptoms may take up to a month to appear. Some people do not have symptoms. They may be completely unaware that they have caught the disease, and therefore do not seek treatment. This increases the risk of complications and the chances of passing the infection on to another person. Symptoms in men include:
Burning and pain while urinating Increased urinary frequency or urgency Discharge from the penis (white, yellow, or green in color) Red or swollen opening of penis (urethra) Tender or swollen testicles Sore throat (gonococcal pharyngitis)
Symptoms in women can be very mild or nonspecific, and may be mistaken for another type of infection. They include:
Vaginal discharge Burning and pain while urinating Increased urination Sore throat Painful sexual intercourse Severe pain in lower abdomen (if the infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and stomach area) Fever (if the infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and stomach area)
If the infection spreads to the bloodstream, fever, rash, and arthritis -like symptoms may occur."
391,What causes Gonorrhea?,"Gonorrhea is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Anyone who has any type of sex can catch gonorrhea. The infection can be spread by contact with the mouth, vagina, penis, or anus. The bacteria grow in warm, moist areas of the body, including the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra). In women, the bacteria may be found in the reproductive tract (which includes the fallopian tubes, uterus, and cervix). The bacteria can even grow in the eyes. Health care providers in every state in the U.S. are required by law to tell their State Board of Health about anyone diagnosed with gonorrhea. The goal of this law is to make sure the patient gets proper follow-up care and that their sexual partners are found and tested. More than 700,000 persons in the United States get gonorrhea every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Gonorrhea is more common in large cities, inner-city areas, populations with lower overall levels of education and people with lower socioeconomic status."
392,Who is at highest risk for Gonorrhea ?,"You are more likely to develop this infection if you:
Have multiple sexual partners Have a partner with a past history of any sexually transmitted disease Do not use a condom during sex Are a man who has sexual contact with another man Have a drug addiction"
393,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gonorrhea ?,"If you have symptoms suggestive of gonorrhea, you should call your health care provider immediately. Most state-sponsored clinics will diagnose and treat STDs without charge."
394,What to expect if I have Gonorrhea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,A gonorrhea infection that has not spread to the bloodstream or other areas almost always can be cured with antibiotics. Gonorrhea that has spread is a more serious infection but almost always gets better with treatment.

396,Is the Disease Fatal?,Yes. HPS can be fatal. It has a mortality rate of 38%.
397,Are there any complications?,"Previous observations of patients that develop HPS from New World Hantaviruses recover completely. No chronic infection has been detected in humans. Some patients have experienced longer than expected recovery times, but the virus has not been shown to leave lasting effects on the patient."
398,What are the symptoms of a Heart attack?,"It's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 9-1-1 if someone is having them. Those symptoms include:
Chest discomfort - pressure, squeezing, or pain. The most common symptom of heart attack is chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It can be mild or severe. Heart attack pain can sometimes feel like indigestion or heartburn. Shortness of breath - Shortness of breath may often occur with or before chest discomfort. Discomfort in the upper body. Upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, sweating
Not all heart attacks begin with a sudden, crushing pain that is often shown on TV or in the movies. The warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack aren’t the same for everyone. Many heart attacks start slowly as mild pain or discomfort. Some people don’t have symptoms at all (this is called a silent heart attack)."
399,What causes Heart attack?,"Heart attacks occur most often as a result of a condition called coronary artery disease (CAD). In CAD, a fatty material called plaque builds up over many years on the inside walls of the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart). Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture, causing a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block the flow of oxygen -rich blood to the part of the heart muscle fed by the artery."
400,Who is at highest risk for Heart attack ?,"Certain risk factors make it more likely that you will develop coronary artery disease (CAD) and have a heart attack. Some risk factors for heart attack can be controlled, while others can't.
Major risk factors for heart attack that you can control include:
Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Overweight and obesity Physical inactivity Diabetes (high blood sugar)
Risk factors that you can't change include:
Age: Risk increases for men older than 45 years and for women older than 55 years (or after menopause). Family history of early CAD: Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with CAD before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with CAD before 65 years of age.
Certain CAD risk factors tend to occur together. When they do, it’s called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person with metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone without metabolic syndrome."
401,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Heart attack ?,"You should seek medical care if you are experiencing chest discomfort or chest pain, upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness or fainting, or breaking out in a cold sweat."
402,What to expect if I have Heart attack  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Each year, about 1.1 million people in the United States have heart attacks, and almost half of them die. CAD, which often results in a heart attack, is the leading killer of both men and women in the United States.
Many more people could recover from heart attacks if they got help faster. Of the people who die from heart attacks, about half die within an hour of the first symptoms and before they reach the hospital."
403,What are the symptoms of Heart block?,"Symptoms depend on the type of heart block you have.
First-degree heart block rarely causes symptoms.
Symptoms of second- and third-degree heart block include:
Chest pain Dizziness Fainting Fatigue Heart failure symptoms Light-headedness Pre-syncope Shortness of breath Syncope
Third degree heart block are more life-threatening than second-degree heart block."
404,What causes Heart block?,"Heart block has many causes. Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired) either from a disease, medication or surgery.
One form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.
In pregnant patients, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.
Congenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.
Many factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:
Damage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Heart failure. Rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle diseases. Sarcoidosis Degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block. Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medications - including digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers - also may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medications for signs of problems. Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes). An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your bdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.
In some cases, acquired heart blockmay go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.
Also, if a medication is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medication is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medications."
405,Who is at highest risk for Heart block ?,"The risk factors for congenital and acquired heart block are different.
If a pregnant patient has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block.
Autoimmune diseases can cause the body to make proteins called antibodies that can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These antibodies may damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.
Congenital heart defects also may result in congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes these defects.
Heredity may play a role in certain heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the condition.
Acquired heart block can occur in people of any age. However, most types of the disorder are more common in older people. This is because many of the risk factors are more common in older people.
People who have a history of heart disease or heart attacks are more likely to have heart block. Examples of heart disease that can lead to heart block include heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle diseases).
Other diseases also may raise the risk of heart block. These include sarcoidosis and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.
Exposure to toxic substances or taking certain medicines, such as digitalis, also can raise your risk of heart block.
Well-trained athletes and young people are at higher risk for first-degree heart block caused by an overly active vagus nerve. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate."
406,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Heart block ?,"If you are experiencing the above-mentioned symptoms for the first time or are severe, call 9–1–1 or have someone drive you to the hospital emergency room. If you have milder symptoms, talk with your doctor right away to find out whether you need prompt treatment."
407,What to expect if I have Heart block  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"First-degree heart block may not cause any symptoms or require treatment. If you have second-degree heart block that doesn't require a pacemaker, talk with your doctor about keeping your heart healthy. Your doctor will tell you whether you need ongoing care for your condition. People who have third-degree heart block and some people who have second-degree heart block need pacemakers. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. If you have a pacemaker, you should take special care to avoid things that may interfere with it. Avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices and devices that have strong magnetic fields. These objects can keep your pacemaker from working properly. Let all of your doctors, dentists, and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker. You also should notify airport screeners. Your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have. Carry this card in your wallet. You may want to consider wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace that states that you have a pacemaker. Certain medical procedures can disrupt pacemakers. Examples include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocauterization during surgery, and shockwave lithotripsy to get rid of kidney stones. Your doctor may need to check your pacemaker several times a year to make sure it is working well. Some pacemakers must be checked in the doctor's office, but others can be checked over the phone. Ask your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. A pacemaker usually would not limit you from doing sports and physical activity. But you may need to avoid full-contact sports, such as football, that can damage the pacemaker."
408,What are the symptoms of Heart murmur?,harmless heart murmur you likely won't have any symptoms and your doctor may discover it when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. presence of this symptoms indicate heart problem: fingertips and lips appear blue Swelling or sudden weight gain Shortness of breath Chronic cough Enlarged liver Enlarged neck veins Poor appetite and failure to grow normally (in infants) Heavy sweating with minimal or no exertion Chest pain Dizziness Fainting
409,What causes of heart murmur?,"If it is innocent murmur that means a normal heart. it is common in newborns and children. An abnormal heart murmur is more serious. In children, usually the cause congenital heart disease. In adults, it is due to acquired heart valve problems.
Physical activity or exercise Pregnancy Fever Not enough red blood cells to carry oxygen (anemia) An increase in the amount of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism)
In children the cause mostly due to structural problems of the heart (congenital heart defects). examples: Holes in the heart. Abnormal blood flow between the heart chambers or blood vessels(shunt) Heart valve abnormalities. Congenital heart valve abnormalities are present at birth, but sometimes aren't discovered until much later in life.
In older children or adults causes of abnormal heart murmurs include infections or conditions that damage the structures of the heart for example: Hardening or thickening of valves, as in mitral stenosis or aortic valve stenosis, can occur as you age. Endocarditis. This infection of the inner lining of your heart and valves when bacteria or other germs lodge in your heart. endocarditis if left untreated can destroy your heart valves in people who already have heart valve abnormalities. Rheumatic fever. rare in the United States."
410,Who is at highest risk for Heart murmur ?,"Family history of a heart defect. Uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension). Infection of the lining of the heart (endocarditis),
Factors that increase your baby's risk of developing a heart murmur include: Illnesses during pregnancy. such as uncontrolled diabetes or a rubella infection. Taking certain medications or illegal drugs during pregnancy."
411,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Heart murmur ?,"Most heart murmurs aren't serious, but if you think you or your child has a heart murmur, make an appointment to see your family doctor. Get medical help if you feel: Chest pain,Breathlessness, fatigue, or fainting for no reason, heart palpitations."
412,What to expect if I have Heart murmur  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Innocent heart murmurs, the prognosis is excellent. For people with other types of heart murmurs, the prognosis depends on the type of heart problem and its severity. In general, even when heart surgery is required, the prognosis is good."
413,Why the Procedure is Performed?,"A heart transplant may be done to treat:
Severe angina that can no longer be treated with medications or other surgeries Severe heart failure, when medicines, other treatments, and surgery no longer help Severe heart defects that were present at birth and cannot be fixed with surgery Life-threatening abnormal heartbeats or rhythms that do not respond to other treatments
Heart transplant surgery may NOT be used in patients who:
Are malnourished Are older than age 55 - 60 Have had a severe stroke or dementia Have had cancer Have HIV infection Have infections such as hepatitis that are active Have insulin-dependent diabetes and other organs that aren't working correctly Have kidney, lung, nerve, or liver disease Have no family support and do not follow their treatment Have other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the neck and leg Have pulmonary hypertension (thickening of blood vessels in the lung) Smoke or abuse alcohol or drugs, or have other lifestyle habits that may damage the new heart
The doctor may not recommend a heart transplant if the patient may not be able to keep up with the many hospital and doctor's office visits, tests, and medications needed to keep the new heart healthy."
414,What are the Risks?,"Reactions to medications Problems breathing
Bleeding Infection
Blood clots (deep venous thrombosis) Damage to the kidneys, liver, or other organs from anti-rejection medications Development of cancer from the drugs used to prevent rejection Heart attack or stroke Heart rhythm problems High cholesterol levels, diabetes, and bone thinning from the use of rejection medications Increased risk for infections due to anti-rejection medications Rejection of the heart Severe coronary artery disease Wound infections"
415,What is the Outlook/Prognosis?,"You should expect to stay in the hospital for 7 to 21 days after a heart transplant. The first 24 to 48 hours will likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). During the first few days after a transplant, you will need close follow-up to make sure that you do not get an infection and your heart is working well.
The recovery period is about 6 months. Often, your transplant team will ask you to stay fairly close to the hospital for the first 3 months. You will need to have regular check-ups with blood tests, x-rays, and echocardiograms for many years.
Fighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body's immune system considers the transplanted organ an infection and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take drugs that suppress the body's immune response. Taking medicines and following your doctor's instructions carefully is very important to preventing rejection.
Biopsies of the heart muscle are often done every month during the first 6 to 12 months after transplant, and then less often after that. This helps the doctor determine if your body is rejecting the new heart, even before you have symptoms.
You must take drugs that prevent transplant rejection for the rest of your life. You will need to understand how to take these medications, and know their side effects.
You can go back to your normal activities as soon as you feel well enough, and after talking with your doctor. However, avoid vigorous physical activity.
To make sure that you do not develop coronary disease after a transplant, you will have cardiac catheterization every year.
Heart transplant prolongs the life of patients who would otherwise die. About 80% of heart transplant patients are alive 2 years after the operation. At 5 years, 70% of people will still be alive after a heart transplant.
The main problem, as with other transplants, is rejection. If rejection can be controlled, survival increases to over 10 years."
416,What are the symptoms of Hemangioma?,"A red to reddish-purple, raised sore (lesion) on the skin A massive, raised tumor with blood vessels Most hemangiomas are on the face and neck."
417,What causes Hemangioma?,"About 30% of hemangiomas are present at birth. The rest appear in the first several months of life.
The hemangioma may be:
In the top skin layers (capillary hemangioma) Deeper in the skin (cavernous hemangioma) A mixture of both"
418,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hemangioma ?,"All birthmarks, including hemangiomas, should be evaluated by the health care provider during a routine examination.
Hemangiomas of the eyelid may interfere with the development of normal vision and must be treated in the first few months of life. Hemangiomas that interfere with breathing, feeding, or other vital functions should also be treated early."
419,What to expect if I have Hemangioma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Small, superficial hemangiomas often disappear on their own. About 50% go away by age 5, and 90% are gone by age 9."
420,Where is HFRS found?,"HFRS is found throughout the world. Haantan virus is widely distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea. Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and western Russia. Dobrava virus is found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide. Saaremaa is found in central Europe and Scandinavia. In the Americas, hantaviruses cause a different disease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome."
421,How do humans get HFRS?,"Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may also occur when infected urine or these other materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. In addition, individuals who work with live rodents can be exposed to hantaviruses through rodent bites from infected animals. Transmission from one human to another may occur, but is extremely rare."
422,Which rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HFRS in humans?,"Rodents are the natural reservoir for hantaviruses. Known carriers include the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), the reservoir for both the Saaremaa and Hantaan virus; the brown or Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), the reservoir for Seoul virus; the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), the reservoir for Puumala virus; and the yellow-necked field mouse (Apodemus flavicollis), which carries Dobrava virus."
423,What are the symptoms of HFRS?,"Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to infectious material, but in rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include intense headaches, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Individuals may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload. The severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause severe symptoms, while Seoul, Saaremaa, and Puumala virus infections are usually more moderate. Complete recovery can take weeks or months."
424,How is HFRS diagnosed?,"Several laboratory tests are used to confirm a diagnosis of HFRS in patients with a clinical history compatible with the disease. Such patients are determined to have HFRS if they have serologic test results positive for hantavirus infection, evidence of hantavirus antigen in tissue by immunohistochemical staining and microscope examination, or evidence of hantavirus RNA sequences in blood or tissue."
425,How is HFRS treated?,"Supportive therapy is the mainstay of care for patients with hantavirus infections. Care includes careful management of the patient’s fluid (hydration) and electrolyte (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride) levels, maintenance of correct oxygen and blood pressure levels, and appropriate treatment of any secondary infections. Dialysis may be required to correct severe fluid overload. Intravenous ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been shown to decrease illness and death associated with HFRS if used very early in the disease."
426,Is HFRS ever fatal?,"Depending upon which virus is causing the HFRS, death occurs in less than 1% to as many as 15% of patients. Fatality ranges from 5-15% for HFRS caused by Hantaan virus, and it is less than 1% for disease caused by Puumala virus."
427,How is HFRS prevented?,"Rodent control is the primary strategy for preventing hantavirus infections. Rodent populations near human communities should be controlled, and rodents should be excluded from homes. Individuals should avoid contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials, and the safety measures described below should be followed when cleaning rodent-infested areas."
428,What are the symptoms of Hemothorax?,"Anxiety Chest pain Low blood pressure Pale, cool and clammy skin Rapid heart rate Rapid, shallow breathing Restlessness Shortness of breath"
429,What causes Hemothorax?,"The most common cause of hemothorax is chest trauma. It can also occur in patients who have:
A defect of blood clotting Death of lung tissue (pulmonary infarction) Lung or pleural cancer Placement of a central venous catheter Thoracic or heart surgery Tuberculosis"
430,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hemothorax ?,"Call 911 if you have:
Any serious injury to the chest. Chest pain or shortness of breath
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have:
Dizziness, fever, or a feeling of heaviness in your chest Severe chest pain Severe difficulty breathing"
431,What to expect if I have Hemothorax  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on the cause of the hemothorax and how quickly treatment is given.
432,What are the symptoms of Hunter syndrome?,"Juvenile form (early-onset, severe form):
Aggressive behavior Hyperactivity Mental function gets worse over time Severe mental retardation Spasticity
Late (mild) form:
Mild to no mental deficiency
Both forms:
Carpal tunnel syndrome Coarse features of the face Deafness (gets worse over time) Increased hair (hypertrichosis) Joint stiffness Large head (macrocephaly)"
433,What causes Hunter syndrome?,"Hunter syndrome is an inherited condition. Boys are most often affected.
The condition is caused by a lack of the enzyme iduronate sulfatase. Without this enzyme, mucopolysaccharides build up in various body tissues, causing damage.
The early-onset, severe form of the disease begins shortly after age 2. A late-onset, mild form causes less severe symptoms to appear later in life."
434,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hunter syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You or your child has a group of these symptoms You know you are a genetic carrier and are considering having children"
435,What to expect if I have Hunter syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,People with the early-onset (severe) form usually live for 10 - 20 years. People with the late-onset (mild) form usually live 20 - 60 years.
436,What are the symptoms of Hurler syndrome?,"Symptoms of Hurler syndrome most often appear between ages 3 and 8. Infants with severe Hurler syndrome appear normal at birth. Facial symptoms may become more noticeable during the first 2 years of life.
Symptoms include:
Abnormal bones in the spine Claw hand Cloudy corneas Deafness Halted growth Heart valve problems Joint disease, including stiffness Mental retardation that gets worse over time Thick, coarse facial features with low nasal bridge"
437,What causes Hurler syndrome?,"Persons with Hurler syndrome do not make a substance called lysosomal alpha-L-iduronidase. This substance, called an enzyme, helps break down long chains of sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). These molecules are found throughout the body, often in mucus and in fluid around the joints.
Without the enzyme, glycosaminoglycans build up and damage organs, including the heart. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.
Hurler syndrome is inherited, which means that your parents must pass the disease on to you. Both parents need to pass down the faulty gene in order for you to develop Hurler syndrome.
Hurler syndrome is a type of mucopolysaccharidosis called MPS I. Hurler syndrome is the most severe type. It is categorized as MPS I H.
The other subtypes of MPS I are:
MPS I H-S (Hurler-Scheie syndrome) MPS I S (Scheie syndrome)"
438,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hurler syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have a family history of Hurler syndrome and are considering having children Your child begins to show symptoms of Hurler syndrome"
439,What to expect if I have Hurler syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hurler syndrome is a disease with a poor outlook. Children with this disease develop nervous system problems, and can die young."
440,What causes Hypercholesterolemia?,"A lipid disorder increases your risk for atherosclerosis, and thus for coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure (hypertension), and other problems.
There are many types of cholesterol. The ones talked about most are:
Total cholesterol: all the cholesterols combined High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: often called good cholesterol Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: often called bad cholesterol
There are several genetic disorders (passed down through families) that lead to abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. They include:
Familial combined hyperlipidemia Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia Familial hypercholesterolemia Familial hypertriglyceridemia
Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels may also be caused by:
Being overweight or obese. (See: Metabolic syndrome) Certain medications, including birth control pills, estrogen, corticosteroids, certain diuretics, beta blockers, and certain anti-depressants Diseases such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and kidney disease Excessive alcohol use Fatty diets that are high in saturated fats (found mainly in red meat, egg yolks, and high-fat dairy products) and trans fatty acids (found in commercial processed food products) Lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle Smoking (which reduces HDL ""good"" cholesterol)"
441,What are the symptoms of Hypertension?,"Most of the time, there are no symptoms. For most patients, high blood pressure is found when they visit their health care provider or have it checked elsewhere.
Because there are no symptoms, people can develop heart disease and kidney problems without knowing they have high blood pressure.
If you have a severe headache, nausea or vomiting, confusion, changes in your vision, or nosebleeds you may have a severe and dangerous form of high blood pressure called malignant hypertension (patient information)|malignant hypertension"
442,What causes Hypertension?,"Hypertension is generally sub divided into 2 types:
Essential hypertension is the most prevalent hypertension type, affecting 90-95% of hypertensive patients.Although there is no direct cause or mechanism identified some factors are considered to cause Essential Hypertension.
Sedentary Lifestyle Obesity accounts for 80-85% of essential hypertension Increased salt intake Increased youalcohol intake Vitamin D Deficiency Family history of high blood pressure Genetic diseases Renin -a hormone produced by the kidneys is thought to activate sympathetic system which functions to control most of body' internal organs under different conditions. High fructose (sugar)corn syrup Metabolic syndrome -in which body develops insulin resistance due to obesity and has high blood pressure, sugar,cholesterol and increased waist circumference.
Secondary hypertension by definition results from an identifiable cause. This type is important to recognize since it's treated differently than essential hypertension, by treating the underlying cause of the elevated blood pressure. Hypertension results compromise or imbalance of the pathophysiological mechanisms, such as the hormone-regulating endocrine system, that regulate blood plasma volume and heart function. Many conditions cause hypertension, some are common and well recognized secondary causes such as
Renovascular Hypertension: Due to fibromuscular dysplasia and renal artery stenosis. In both conditiions, increased blood pressure occurs due to narrowing of arteries supplying to the kidney. Pheochromocytoma: Caused by an excessive secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine which promotes vasoconstriction Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome): Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, Liddle's syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism), glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism Cushing's syndrome - an excessive secretion of glucocorticoids causes the hypertension Hyperparathyroidism Acromegaly Hyperthyroidism Hypothyroidism Chronic Kidney disease Coarctation of Aorta Drugs: Oral Contraceptives, steroids, NSAIDs, nasal decongestants with adrenergic effects, MAOIs, adrenoceptor stimulants. Scleroderma Neurofibromatosis Pregnancy -unclear mechanism Obstructive sleep apnea Fever: unclear etiology Liquorice White coat hypertension: that is, elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but not in other settings, probably due to the anxiety some people experience during a clinic visit. Perioperative hypertension is development of hypertension just before, during or after surgery. It may occur before surgery during the induction of anesthesia; intraoperatively e.g. by pain-induced sympathetic nervous system stimulation; in the early postanesthesia period, e.g. by pain-induced sympathetic stimulation, hypothermia, hypoxia, or hypervolemia from excessive intraoperative fluid therapy; and in the 24 to 48 hours after the postoperativ period as fluid is mobilized from the extravascular space. In addition, hypertension may develop perioperatively because of discontinuation of long-term antihypertensive medication."
443,Who is at highest risk for Hypertension ?,"Essential hypertension which is the more common form has several risk factors.Of most importance are
Increased salt intake in diet Obesity Smoking Increased alcohol intake Family history where parents are hypertensive High cholesterol diet Certain personality traits like in general people who are more commmonly impatient,suffer from high anxiety state and have hostile attitudes.
There is a debate over Hypertension to be more common among black population as compared to whites.It is seen to be more common though exact though there is no exactt reason or mechanism for it.Currently, healthcare professionals identify it to be more common due to
Increased salt intake and cholesterol diet Lower socioeconomic status/stress"
444,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypertension ?,"There is no specific rule of thumb.But, one should have have blood pressure every 2 years by the primary care doctor if it is below 120/80 and yearly if blood pressure ranges from 120-139/80-89 according to the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)guidelines. 
In the setting of blood pressure >120/80 with severe headaches,vision difficulty,dizziness,loss of consciousness,chest pain,leg and arm weakness,nausea,vomiting and fatigue one should seek for urgent medical care.Hypertension is generally associated with a wide variety of symptoms but generally causes problems to the heart,brain,eyes/vision,kidneys,nerves and arm/leg weakness."
445,What to expect if I have Hypertension  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hypertension cannot be completely cured.It can be well controlled under the normal limits if one tries to follow lifestyle preventive measures like exercising, eating a heart healthy diet, avoiding the different risk factors like high cholesterol salty diet, smoking alcohol intake,stress.Besides that medications are given as mentioned above.But if not well-controlled it can lead to various complications as are described below.So it is always important to maintain a healthy diet and active lifestyle.<refhttp://www.americanheart.org/</ref>"
446,What are the symptoms of Hypertensive nephropathy?,"Most of the patients with hypertensive nephropathy have no specific symptoms, although a majority have a history of chronic high blood pressure.
If high blood pressure left untreated or uncontrolled can accelerate the kidney damage, which leads to failure of the kidneys to work correctly.
Symptoms of kidney failure is similar to chronic kidney disease, including:
Weakness Fatigue Headache Nausea loss of appetite weight loss increased or decreased in urine volume itchy skin dry skin Muscle weakness swelling of face, arms and legs Sleep difficulties difficulties in concentration and memory"
447,What causes Hypertensive nephropathy?,Hypertensive nephropathy develops as a result of high blood pressure for many years. High blood pressure is known as the second cause of end stage renal disease.
448,Who is at highest risk for Hypertensive nephropathy ?,"Certain conditions increase your risk for hypertensive nephropathy, including:
high blood pressure for a long time, especially untreated or uncontrolled blood pressure. Diabetes Smoking Obesity African Americans"
449,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypertensive nephropathy ?,"You must make an appointment with the doctor if you have any symptoms and signs listed above. If you have high blood pressure or have other conditions that increase your risk for hypertensive nephropathy, your doctor might do a regular check of your Blood pressure and kidney function with some urine and blood tests."
450,What to expect if I have Hypertensive nephropathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without dialysis or a kidney transplant, death will occur from the buildup of fluids and waste products in the body. Both of these treatments can have serious risks and consequences. The outcome is different for each person."
451,What are the symptoms of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"Some patients have no symptoms. They may not even realize they have the condition until it is found during a routine medical exam. Chest pain, Dizziness, Fainting, especially during exercise Heart failure (in some patients) High blood pressure (hypertension) Light-headedness, especially with or after activity or exercise Sensation of feeling the heartbeat (palpitations) Shortness of breath Other symptoms that may occur are:
Fatigue, Reduced activity tolerance, Shortness of breath when lying down (orthopnea)."
452,What causes Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is often asymmetrical, meaning one part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. The condition is usually passed down through families (inherited). It is believed to be a result of several problems (defects) with the genes that control heart muscle growth.
Younger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the condition is seen in people of all ages."
453,Who is at highest risk for Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ?,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in young athletes who seem completely healthy but die during heavy exercise. However, certain normal changes in athletes' hearts can confuse the diagnosis.
The first symptom of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy among many young patients is sudden collapse and possible death. This is caused by very abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), or from the blockage of blood leaving the heart to the rest of the body."
454,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You have any symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy You develop chest pain, palpitations, faintness, or other new or unexplained symptoms"
455,What to expect if I have Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may not have symptoms and live a normal lifespan. Others may get worse gradually or rapidly. The condition may develop into a dilated cardiomyopathy in some patients.
People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at higher risk for sudden death than the normal population. Sudden death can occur at a young age.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a well-known cause of sudden death in athletes. Almost half of deaths in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy happen during or just after the patient has done some type of physical activity.
If you have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, always follow your doctor's advice concerning exercise and medical appointments. Patients are sometimes advised to avoid strenuous exercise."
456,What are the symptoms of Hypokalemia?,"A small drop in potassium usually doesn't cause symptoms. However, a big drop in the level can be life threatening.
Symptoms of hypokalemia include:
Abnormal heart rhythms (dysrhythmias), especially in people with heart disease Constipation Fatigue Muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis) Muscle weakness or spasms Paralysis (which can include the lungs)"
457,What causes Hypokalemia?,"Potassium is needed for cells, especially nerve and muscle cells, to function properly. You get potassium through food. The kidneys remove excess potassium in the urine to keep a proper balance of the mineral in the body.
Hypokalemia is a metabolic disorder that occurs when the level of potassium in the blood drops too low.
Possible causes of hypokalemia include:
Antibiotics (penicillin, nafcillin, carbenicillin, gentamicin, amphotericin B, foscarnet) Diarrhea (including the use of too many laxatives, which can cause diarrhea) Diseases that affect the kidneys' ability to retain potassium (Liddle syndrome, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, Fanconi syndrome) Diuretic medications, which can cause excess urination Eating disorders (such as bulimia) Eating large amounts of licorice or using products such as herbal teas and chewing tobaccos that contain licorice made with glycyrrhetinic acid (this substance is no longer used in licorice made in the United States) Magnesium deficiency Sweating Vomiting"
458,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypokalemia ?,"Call your health care provider if you have been vomiting or have had excessive diarrhea, or if you are taking diuretics and have symptoms of hypokalemia."
459,What to expect if I have Hypokalemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Taking potassium supplements can usually correct the problem. In severe cases, without proper treatment a severe drop in potassium levels can lead to serious heart rhythm problems that can be fatal."
460,What are the symptoms of Hypoplastic left heart syndrome?,"At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may appear normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:
Bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color Cold hands and feet (extremities) Lethargy Poor pulse Poor suckling and feeding Pounding heart Rapid breathing Shortness of breath
In healthy newborns, bluish color in the hands and feet is a response to cold (this reaction is called peripheral cyanosis).
However, a bluish color in the chest or abdomen, lips, and tongue is abnormal (called central cyanosis). It is a sign that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. Central cyanosis often increases with crying."
461,What causes Hypoplastic left heart syndrome?,"Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. Approximately 10% of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.
The problem develops before birth when there is not enough growth of the left ventricle and other structures, including the:
Aorta - the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body Entrance and exit of the ventricle Mitral and aortic valves
This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be incompletely developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.
In patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.
The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and the left side of the heart, or between the arteries and pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two of these connections:
Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium) Ductus arteriosus (a small blood vesel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)
Both of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.
In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body. Babies with known hypoplastic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open.
Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using heart catheterization."
462,Who is at highest risk for Hypoplastic left heart syndrome ?,Hypoplastic left heart is more common in males than in females. Approximately 10% of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.
463,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypoplastic left heart syndrome ?,"Contact your health care provider immediately if your infant:
Eats less (decreased feeding) Has blue (cyanotic) skin or mucus membranes Has new changes in breathing patterns"
464,What to expect if I have Hypoplastic left heart syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If left untreated, hypoplastic left heart syndrome is fatal. Survival rates for the staged repair continue to rise as surgical techniques and postoperative management improve. Survival after the first stage is more than 75%.
The size and function of the right ventricle are important in determining the child's outcome after surgery."
465,What are the symptoms of Hypotension?,"Symptoms may include:
Blurry vision Confusion Dizziness Fainting Light-headedness Sleepiness Weakness"
466,What causes Hypotension?,"Blood pressure that is borderline low for one person may be normal for another. Most normal blood pressures fall in the range of 90/60 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) to 130/80 mm Hg. But a significant drop, even as little as 20 mm Hg, can cause problems for some people.
There are three main types of hypotension: Orthostatic hypotension, including postprandial orthostatic hypotension Neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) Severe hypotension brought on by a sudden loss of blood (shock), infection, or severe allergic reaction
Orthostatic hypotension is brought on by a sudden change in body position, most often when shifting from lying down to standing. This type of hypotension usually lasts only a few seconds or minutes. If this type of hypotension occurs after eating, it is called postprandial orthostatic hypotension. This form most commonly affects older adults, those with high blood pressure, and persons with Parkinson's disease. NMH most often affects young adults and children. It occurs when a person has been standing for a long time. Children usually outgrow this type of hypotension. Low blood pressure is commonly caused by drugs such as: Alcohol Anti-anxiety medications Certain antidepressants Diuretics Heart medicines, including those used to treat high blood pressure and coronary heart disease Medications used for surgery Painkillers Other causes of low blood pressure include: Advanced diabetes Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic response) Changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmias) Dehydration Fainting"
467,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypotension ?,"When you have symptoms from a drop in blood pressure, you should immediately sit or lie down and raise your feet above heart level.
If low blood pressure causes a person to pass out (become unconscious), seek immediate medical treatment or call the local emergency number (such as 911). If the person is not breathing or has no pulse, begin CPR.
Call your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:
Black or maroon stools Chest pain Dizziness, lightheadedness Fainting Fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit Irregular heartbeat Shortness of breath
Also call your doctor if you have:
Burning with urination or other urinary symptoms Cough with phlegm Inability to eat or drink Prolonged diarrhea or vomiting"
468,What to expect if I have Hypotension  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Low blood pressure can usually be treated with success.
469,When could I drive after i underwent Implantable cardiac defibrillator insertion discharge instructions ?,You should not drive after the procedure without asking your doctor when you could do that. This is different for everyone.
470,What medications should I take after Implantable cardiac defibrillator insertion discharge instructions ?,Ask your doctor whether you should go back to taking the medications you were on before the procedure. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking.
471,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and do not take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
472,What precautions should I take?,"Most devices will not interfere with your defibrillator, but some with strong magnetic fields might. Ask your doctor or nurse if you have questions about any specific device. Most appliances in your home are safe to be around. This includes your refrigerator, washer, dryer, toaster, blender, personal computer and fax machine, hair dryer, stove, CD player, remote controls, and microwave. There are several devices you should keep at least 12 inches away from the site where your ICD is placed under your skin. These include:
Battery-powered cordless tools (such as screwdrivers and drills) Plug-in power tools (such as drills and table saws) Electric lawn mowers and leaf blowers Slot machines Stereo speakers
Tell all health care providers that you have an ICD. Some medical equipment may harm your ICD. Because MRI machines have powerful magnets, talk to your doctor before having an MRI. Stay away from large motors, generators, and equipment. Do not lean over the open hood of a running car. Also stay away from:
Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers Electrical or gasoline powered appliances
If you have a cell phone:
Do not put it in a pocket on the same side of your body as your ICD. When using your cell phone, hold it to your ear on the opposite side of your body.
Be careful around metal detectors and security wands.
Handheld security wands may interfere with your ICD. Show your wallet card and ask to be hand searched. Most security gates at airports and stores are okay. But do not stand near these devices for long periods. Your ICD may set off alarms."
473,When may I resume my regular activities?,"Do not use your arm on the side where your pacemaker is inserted to lift, push or pull anything weighing more than five pounds, at least for the first 6 weeks. You may do the daily activities like face washing, hair combing, and tooth brushing. You should avoid swimming, playing golf or playing tennis after the procedure."
474,When can I go back to work after Implantable cardiac defibrillator insertion discharge instructions ?,It depends on the type of your work. You can ask your doctor when you can go back to work.
475,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Implantable cardiac defibrillator insertion discharge instructions ?,"You should tell your doctor about every shock you feel from your ICD. The settings of your ICD may need to be adjusted, or your medicines may need to be changed. Also call your doctor if:
Your wound looks infected. Signs of infection are redness, increased drainage, swelling, and pain. You are having the symptoms you had before your ICD was implanted. You are dizzy, have chest pain, or are short of breath. You have hiccups that do not go away. You were unconscious for a moment. Your ICD has sent a shock and you still do not feel well or you pass out. Talk to your doctor about when to call the doctor's office."
476,What are the symptoms of Interrupted aortic arch?,"The signs and symptoms of interrupted aortic arch depend on the site of the arch interruption. Usual symptoms include:
Cyanosis Rapid breathing Fast heart rate Weakness or fatigue Poor feeding
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
477,Who is at highest risk for Interrupted aortic arch ?,"Like many congenital heart disease, the cause of interrupted aortic arch is not clear. Clinical surveys and basic research suggest that the gene mutation may play an important role during the pregnancy."
478,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Interrupted aortic arch ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has interrupted aortic arch and symptoms do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms appear. If your baby experiences either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Sudden shortness of breath Cyanosis"
479,What to expect if I have Interrupted aortic arch  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of interrupted aortic arch depends on the effect of surgery. In most cases, the prognosis is excellent with good surgical repair."
480,How to Evaluate the post-stent-deployment angiogram?,"Following coronary stent implantation, the following set of steps is one way to systematically evaluate the post-stent-deployment angiogram.
Is there any injury to the proximal vessel from guide catheter manipulation? Is the stent well expanded throughout its length, or are there residual stenoses? Does the stented segment of the vessel appear hazy? Did the stent deployment compromise blood flow in any branch vessels? Are there any tears in the vessel such as proximal or distal edge dissection, or dye extravasation to the vessel wall or the pericardium? How is the flow in the coronary artery and the myocardium that it supplies? Is there any distal microvasculature perforation secondary to the guide wire manipulation?
In addition to the angiographic interpretation, clinical assessment is very important. Chest discomfort, arrhythmia, ischemic ECG changes, and hypotension may all result following stent deployment."
481,What are the symptoms of Intracranial aneurysms?,"A person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason.
A cerebral aneurysm may begin to ""leak"" a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a patient may describe as ""the worst headache of my life."" Another phrase used to describe this is a sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a rupture days or weeks after the headache first happens.
Symptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain. Symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on, but may include:
Double vision Loss of vision Headaches Eye pain Neck pain Stiff neck
A sudden, severe headache is one symptom of an aneurysm that has ruptured. Other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture may include:
Confusion, lethargy, sleepiness, or stupor Eyelid drooping Headaches with nausea or vomiting Muscle weakness or difficulty moving any part of the body Numbness or decreased sensation in any part of the body Seizures Speech impairment Stiff neck (occasionally) Vision changes (double vision, loss of vision)
NOTE: A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Seek immediate medical help."
482,What causes Intracranial aneurysms?,"Aneurysms in the brain occur when there is a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm may be present from birth (congenital) or it may develop later in life, such as after a blood vessel is injured.
There are many different types of aneurysms. A berry aneurysm can vary in size from a few millimeters to over a centimeter. Giant berry aneurysms can reach well over 2 centimeters. These are more common in adults. Multiple berry aneurysms are inherited more often than other types of aneurysms.
Other types of cerebral aneurysm involve widening of an entire blood vessel, or they may appear as a ""ballooning out"" of part of a blood vessel. Such aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel that supplies the brain. Atherosclerosis, trauma, and infection, which can injure the blood vessel wall, can cause cerebral aneurysms."
483,Who is at highest risk for Intracranial aneurysms ?,Family history of cerebral aneurysms Polycystic kidney disease Coarctation of the aorta High blood pressure
484,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Intracranial aneurysms ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a sudden or severe headache, especially if you also have nausea, vomiting, seizures, or any other neurological symptoms.
Also call if you have a headache that is unusual for you, especially if it is severe or your worst headache ever."
485,What to expect if I have Intracranial aneurysms  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies. Patients who are in deep comas after an aneurysm rupture generally do not do as well as those with less severe symptoms. Ruptured cerebral aneurysms are often deadly. About 25% of people die within 1 day, and another 25% die within about 3 months. Of those who survive, about 25% will have some sort of permanent disability."
486,What are the symptoms of Ischemic colitis?,Abdominal pain Blood in the stool (may be bright red or maroon). Diarrhea Fever Vomiting
487,What causes Ischemic colitis?,Ischemic colitis mainly affects people over 50. Many of them have a history of peripheral vascular disease.
488,Who is at highest risk for Ischemic colitis ?,"Risk factors include:
Atrial fibrillation Blockage of the large bowel Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Congestive heart failure Diabetes High blood pressure Irritable bowel syndrome Low blood pressure Past aortic surgery in which damage occurred to the artery that supplies the colon. Rheumatoid arthritis Use of medications that cause constipation"
489,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ischemic colitis ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of ischemic colitis.
490,What to expect if I have Ischemic colitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most cases of ischemic colitis are mild and will improve on their own. They do not need surgical treatment. The death rate is high when gangrene occurs because there is not enough blood supply.
491,What are the symptoms of Kawasaki disease?,"Kawasaki disease often begins with a high and persistent fever greater than 102 °F, often as high as 104 °F. A persistent fever lasting at least 5 days is considered a classic sign. The fever may last for up to 2 weeks and does not usually go away with normal doses of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen.
Other symptoms often include:
Extremely bloodshot or red eyes (without pus or drainage) Bright red, chapped, or cracked lips Red mucous membranes in the mouth Strawberry tongue, white coating on the tongue, or prominent red bumps on the back of the tongue Red palms of the hands and the soles of the feet Swollen hands and feet Skin rashes on the middle of the body, NOT blister-like Peeling skin in the genital area, hands, and feet (especially around the nails, palms, and soles) Swollen lymph nodes (frequently only one lymph node is swollen), particularly in the neck area Joint pain and swelling, frequently on both sides of the body
Additional symptoms may include:
Irritability Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain Cough and runny nose"
492,What causes Kawasaki disease?,"Kawasaki disease is a poorly understood illness. The cause has not been determined. It may be an autoimmune disorder. The disorder affects the mucus membranes, lymph nodes, walls of the blood vessels, and the heart.
Kawasaki disease can cause inflammation of blood vessels in the arteries, especially the coronary arteries. This inflammation can lead to aneurysms. An aneurysm can lead to a heart attack, even in young children, although this is rare."
493,Who is at highest risk for Kawasaki disease ?,"Kawasaki disease occurs most frequently in Japan, where the disease was first discovered. In the United States, after congenital heart defects, Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of heart disease in children. Most of these patients are younger than age 5. The disease occurs more often in boys than in girls."
494,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Kawasaki disease ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of Kawasaki disease develop. A persistent high fever that does not come down with acetaminophen or ibuprofen and lasts more than 24 hours should be evaluated by a health care provider.
495,What to expect if I have Kawasaki disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With early recognition and treatment, full recovery can be expected. However, about 1% of patients die from complications of coronary blood vessel inflammation. Patients who have had Kawasaki disease should have an echocardiogram every 1 - 2 years to screen for heart problems."
496,What are the symptoms of Hyperlipidemia?,Hyperlipidemia itself usually does not produce any symptoms and is often discovered during routine screening. Family history of premature coronary heart disease and severe hyperlipidemia may be present. Patient may have symptoms consistent with its complications.
497,What causes Hyperlipidemia?,"A lipid disorder increases your risk for atherosclerosis, and thus for heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure (hypertension), and other problems.
There are many types of cholesterol. The ones talked about most are:
Total cholesterol - all the cholesterols combined High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol - often called ""good"" cholesterol Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - often called ""bad"" cholesterol
There are several genetic disorders (passed down through families) that lead to abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. They include:
Familial combined hyperlipidemia Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia Familial hypercholesterolemia Familial hypertriglyceridemia
Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels may also be caused by:
Being overweight or obese. See: Metabolic syndrome Certain medications, including birth control pills, estrogen, corticosteroids, certain diuretics, beta blockers, and certain antidepressants Diseases such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and kidney disease Excessive alcohol use Fatty diets that are high in saturated fats (found mainly in red meat, egg yolks, and high-fat dairy products) and trans fatty acids (found in commercial processed food products) Lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle Smoking (which reduces HDL ""good"" cholesterol)"
498,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Lipoprotein disorders ?,"If you have high lipid levels or other risk factors for heart diseases, like smoking, diabetes or high blood pressure make appointments as recommended by your doctor."
499,What to expect if I have Lipoprotein disorders  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hyperlipidemia can lead to hardening of the arteries, also called atherosclerosis. This occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries and form hard structures called plaques. Over time, these plaques can block the arteries and cause heart disease, stroke, and other symptoms or problems throughout the body. If you are diagnosed with high cholesterol, you will probably need to continue lifestyle changes and drug treatment throughout your life. Periodic monitoring of your lipid profile may be necessary. Reducing high cholesterol levels will slow the progression of atherosclerosis and prevent complications."
500,What are the Symptoms of Lyme Disease?,"It's important to know the symptoms of Lyme disease and to seek medical help if you think have Lyme disease. Early signs and symptoms (3 to 30 days after tick bite): The first symptom is usually a red rash at the site of tick bite, which may look like a bullseye, but not all people with Lyme disease have a rash. The rash is called erythema chronicum migrans or erythema migrans (EM). EM occurs in approximately 70 to 80 percent of infected persons. EM begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3 to 30 days (average is about 7 days). EM expands gradually over a period of days reaching up to 12 inches or more (30 cm) across. EM may feel warm to the touch but is rarely itchy or painful. Sometimes, EM clears as it enlarges, resulting in a target or bullseye appearance. EM may appear on any area of the body but is usually present on areas including the axilla, inguinal region, popliteal fossa, or along belt line. The rash may or may not be associated with flu-like symptoms including: Fever and/or chills Headache Body aches Joint aches Stiff neck Fatigue Classic Lyme disease rash - Source: CDC.gov
Late Signs and Symptoms (days to months after tick bite): Severe headaches and neck stiffness Multiple erythema migrans rashes on other areas of the body. Arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, particularly of the knees and other large joints. Facial palsy (loss of muscle tone or droop on one or both sides of the face). Intermittent pain in tendons, muscles, joints, and bones. Heart palpitations or an irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis). Episodes of dizziness or shortness of breath. Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Nerve pain. Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet. Problems with short-term memory.
Notes Fever and other flu-like symptoms may occur in the absence of rash. A small bump or redness at the site of a tick bite that occurs immediately and resembles a mosquito bite, is common. This irritation generally goes away in 1-2 days and is not a sign of Lyme disease. A rash with a very similar appearance to EM occurs with Southern Tick-associated Rash Illness (STARI), but is not Lyme disease. Ticks can spread other organisms that may cause a different type of rash. What Causes Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacterial infection you get from bite of an infected tick. The majority of Lyme disease in North America is caused by bite of black-legged tick, or deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Other ticks that transmit Lyme disease are the sheep tick, castor bean tick, or European castor bean tick (Ixodes ricinus) in the Europe, the Western black legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in the Pacific region of North America, and the taiga tick (Ixodes persulactus) in Europe, Central and Northern Asia, China, and Japan. Only 20% of individuals infected with Lyme disease by the deer tick are aware of having had any tick bite. I. scapularis, the primary vector of Lyme disease in Eastern North America - Source: Gross L (2006) A New View on Lyme Disease: Rodents Hold the Key to Annual Risk. PLoS Biol 4(6): e182. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040182"
501,Who is at highest risk for Lyme disease ?,"Individuals who spend time outdoors and/or have pets that go outdoors in endemic regions are at risk for tick-borne disease.
Exposure to ticks: Individuals with frequent exposure to dogs and who reside near wooded areas or areas with high grass may also be at increased risk of tick-borne infection. Individuals with outdoor occupations and who work outside with bare or exposed skin are at a high risk of contracting Lyme disease. Failing to remove a tick as soon as you see it on your skin (the longer a tick is attached to your skin, the greater your risk of developing Lyme disease) also increases risk of developing Lyme disease.
Endemic Regions: About 95% of all reported cases are confined to 14 states including Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Any individual traveling or living within these five geographic areas including New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central is at a heightened risk of exposure to Lyme disease.
Seasonal Variation: The majority of Lyme disease cases are reported during the summer months of May to August. Case incidence increases in May, peaks in June and July, and tapers off in August.
Rarer forms of Transmission: Cases of blood transfusion and organ transplantation have been recorded as methods of transmission but transmission through this avenue is rare."
502,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Lyme disease ?,"You should seek medical care if:
You are bitten by a tick. You have a rash similar to erythema migrans (even if you do not remember getting bitten by a tick). After removal of a tick with the proper procedure."
503,Where to find Medical Care for Lyme Disease?,Medical care for Lyme disease can be found here.
504,What to expect if I have Lyme disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"For early cases, prompt treatment is usually curative. However, the severity and treatment of Lyme disease may be complicated due to: Late diagnosis Failure of antibiotic treatment Coinfection with other tick-borne diseases including Ehrlichiosis and Babesiosis Immune suppression in the patient Some patients with Lyme disease have fatigue, joint and/or muscle pain, and neurocognitive symptoms persisting for years despite antibiotic treatment. Patients with late stage Lyme disease have been shown to experience a level of physical disability similar to that seen in congestive heart failure. Though rare, Lyme disease can be fatal."
505,What are the symptoms of Malignant hypertension?,"Blurred vision Change in mental status Anxiety Confusion Decreased alertness, decreased ability to concentrate Fatigue Restlessness Sleepiness, stupor, lethargy
Chest pain (feeling of crushing or pressure) Cough Headache Nausea or vomiting Numbness of the arms, legs, face, or other areas Reduced urine Seizure Shortness of breath Weakness of the arms, legs, face, or other areas"
506,What causes Malignant hypertension?,"The disorder affects about 1% of people with high blood pressure, including both children and adults. It is more common in younger adults, especially African-American men.
It also occurs in people with:
Collagen vascular disorders Kidney problems Toxemia of pregnancy
You are at high risk for malignant hypertension if you have had:
Kidney failure Renal hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis"
507,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Malignant hypertension ?,"Go to the emergency room or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of malignant hypertension. This is an emergency condition and it can be life-threatening.
Call your health care provider if you know you have poorly controlled high blood pressure."
508,What to expect if I have Malignant hypertension  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many body systems are at serious risk from the extreme rise in blood pressure. Many organs, including the brain, eyes, blood vessels, heart, and kidneys may be damaged.
The blood vessels of the kidney are very likely to be damaged by pressure. Kidney failure may develop, which may be permanent and need dialysis (kidney machine).
If treated right away, malignant hypertension can often be controlled without causing permanent problems. If it is not treated right away, complications may be severe and life-threatening."
509,What are the symptoms of Mediastinitis?,Chest pain Chills Coughing up blood Fever Malaise Shortness of breath
510,What causes Mediastinitis?,"Mediastinitis may occur suddenly (acute) or may develop slowly and get worse over time (chronic). Most cases occur in patients who have had open chest surgery. Less than 5 percent of patients develop mediastinitis after having chest surgery.
Patients may have a tear in their esophagus that causes mediastinitis. Causes of the tear include:
A procedure such as endoscopy
Forceful or constant vomiting
Trauma
Other causes of mediastinitis include:
Cancer
Histoplasmosis
Radiation
Sarcoidosis
Tuberculosis"
511,Who is at risk for Mediastinitis?,"Risk factors include:
Problems in the upper gastrointestinal tract
Recent chest surgery or endoscopy
Weak immune system"
512,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mediastinitis ?,"Contact your health care provider if you have had open chest surgery and develop:
Chest pain Chills Drainage from the wound Fever Shortness of breath
If you have tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or sarcoidosis and develop any of these symptoms, contact your health care provider right away."
513,What to expect if I have Mediastinitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well a person does depends on the cause of the mediastinitis.
Mediastinitis after open chest surgery is very serious. There is a significant risk of dying from the condition."
514,What are the symptoms of Metabolic syndrome?,Extra weight around your waist (central or abdominal obesity).
515,What causes Metabolic syndrome?,"Metabolic syndrome is becoming more and more common in the United States. Researchers are not sure whether the syndrome is due to one single cause, but all of the risks for the syndrome are related to obesity.
The two most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are:
Extra weight around the middle and upper parts of the body (central obesity). The body may be described as ""apple-shaped."" Insulin resistance, in which the body cannot use insulin effectively. Insulin is needed to help control the amount of sugar in the body. As a result, blood sugar and fat levels rise.
Other risk factors include:
Aging Genes that make you more likely to develop this condition Hormone changes Lack of exercise
People who have metabolic syndrome often have two other problems that can either cause the condition or make it worse:
Excess blood clotting Low levels of inflammation throughout the body"
516,Who is at highest risk for Metabolic syndrome ?,Patients who are obese and have family history are at increased risks.
517,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Metabolic syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you have signs or symptoms of this condition.
518,What to expect if I have Metabolic syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,People with metabolic syndrome have an increased long-term risk for developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
519,What are the symptoms of Mitral regurgitation?,"Symptoms for acute mitral regurgitation include chest pain unrelated to coronary artery disease or heart attack, cough, rapid breathing, shortness of breath that increases when lying flat (orthopnea), and sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations). These symptoms may start suddenly.
For chronic mitral regurgitation there are often no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they often develop gradually and may include cough, fatigue, exhaustion, and light-headedness, palpitations (related to atrial fibrillation), shortness of breath during activity and when lying down, and excessive urination at night."
520,What causes Mitral regurgitation?,"Regurgitation means leaking from a valve that doesn't close all the way. It is caused by diseases that weaken or damage the valve or its supporting structures. Mitral regurgitation becomes chronic when the condition persists rather than occurring for only a short time period. Chronic mitral regurgitation should be distinguished from acute mitral regurgitation.
In acute mitral regurgitation, the mitral valve doesn't close all the way and blood flows backward into the left upper heart chamber (atrium). This leads to a decrease in blood flow to the rest of the body. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder.
Acute mitral regurgitation may be caused by dysfunction or injury to the valve following a heart attack or infection of the heart valve (infective endocarditis). These conditions may rupture the valve or surrounding structures, leaving an opening for blood to move backwards.
Mitral valve prolapse is a relatively common cause of chronic mitral regurgitation.
About one-third of all cases of chronic mitral regurgitation are caused by rheumatic heart disease, a complication of untreated strep throat that is becoming less common.
Congenital (present from birth) mitral regurgitation is rare if it is not part of a more complex heart defect or syndrome.
Chronic mitral regurgitation can also be caused by:
Atherosclerosis Endocarditis Heart tumors High blood pressure Marfan syndrome Swelling of the left lower heart chamber Untreated syphilis (rare)
Risk factors include an individual or family history of any of the disorders mentioned above and use of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine (appetite suppressants banned by the FDA) for 4 or more months."
521,Who is at highest risk for Mitral regurgitation ?,"Persons who already have cardiac disease, sustained trauma to the chest area, have congenital heart abnormalities, or have had endocarditis or rheumatic fever are at risk for mitral regurgitation."
522,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mitral regurgitation ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation, or if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.
Call your health care provider if you are being treated for this condition and develop signs of infection, which include:
Chills Fever General ill feeling Headache Muscle aches"
523,What to expect if I have Mitral regurgitation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well a patient does depends on the cause and severity of the valve leakage. Milder forms may become a chronic condition.
Acute mitral regurgitation can rarely be controlled with medications. Surgery is usually needed to repair or replace the mitral valve.
Abnormal heart rhythms associated with acute mitral regurgitation can sometimes be deadly."
524,What are the symptoms of Mitral stenosis?,"Among adults there may be no symptoms at all. Symptoms may appear or get worse with exercise or any activity that raises the heart rate. Symptoms may include: Chest discomfort: Patients may feel tight, crushing, pressure, squeezing, constricting, increasing with activity and decreasing with rest. The pain may radiate to the arm, neck, jaw, or other areas. Cough, possibly hemoptysis. Difficulty breathing during or after exercise or when lying flat. Fatigue. Frequent respiratory infections such as bronchitis. Palpitations. Swelling of feet or ankles. Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Among infants and children, symptoms may be present from birth (congenital), and almost always develop within the first 2 years of life. Symptoms include: Bluish discoloration of the skin or mucus membranes (cyanosis). Poor growth. Shortness of breath."
525,What causes Mitral stenosis?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of mitral stenosis is related to several factors:
A history of rheumatic fever and recurrent strep infections. The valve problems develop 5 - 10 years after the rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is becoming rare in the United States, so mitral stenosis is also less common. Radiation treatment involving the chest. Medications such as ergot preparations used for migraines. Rarely, there maybe calcium deposits forming around the mitral valve and cause mitral stenosis in adults. Children may be born with mitral stenosis (congenital) or other birth defects involving the heart that cause mitral stenosis. Often, there are other heart defects present, along with the mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis may run in families."
526,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mitral stenosis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of mitral stenosis. Call your health care provider if your symptoms do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms appear. If you experience either of the following symptoms, you should seek urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Hemoptysis. Difficulty breathing when lying flat; may wake up with difficulty breathing. Palpitation."
527,What to expect if I have Mitral stenosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies widely. The disorder may be mild, without symptoms, or may be more severe and eventually disabling, this depends on:
The severity of mitral stenosis, such as mitral valve area. Heart function With/without complications such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, blood clots to the brain, intestines, kidneys, or other areas, heart failure, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, etc. Whether or not the mitral valve can be repaired or replaced by surgery.
Complications may be severe or life threatening. Mitral stenosis is usually controllable with treatment and improved with valvuloplasty or surgery."
528,What are the symptoms of Mitral valve prolapse?,"Many patients with mitral valve prolapse do not have symptoms.
The group of symptoms found in patients with mitral valve prolapse is called mitral valve prolapse syndrome and includes:
Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) Chest pain (not caused by coronary artery disease or a heart attack) Difficulty breathing after activity Fatigue Cough Shortness of breath when lying flat (orthopnea)
Note: There may be no symptoms, or symptoms may develop slowly"
529,What causes Mitral valve prolapse?,"The mitral valve helps blood on the left side of the heart flow in one direction. It closes to keep blood from moving backwards when the heart beats (contracts).
Mitral valve prolapse is the term used when the valve does not close properly. It can be caused by many different things. In most cases, it is harmless and patients usually do not know they have the problem. As much as 10% of the population has some minor, insignificant form of mitral valve prolapse, but it does not generally affect their lifestyle.
In a small number of cases, the prolapse can cause blood to leak backwards. This is called mitral regurgitation.
Mitral valves that are structurally abnormal can raise the risk for bacterial infection.
Some forms of mitral valve prolapse seem to be passed down through families (inherited). Mitral valve prolapse has been associated with Graves disease.
Mitral valve prolapse often affects thin women who may have minor chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or other disorders.
Mitral valve prolapse is associated with some connective tissue disorders, especially Marfan syndrome. Other conditions include:
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Osteogenesis imperfecta Polycystic kidney disease"
530,How is Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive) done?,"Before your surgery you will receive general anesthesia. This will make you unconscious and unable to feel pain.
There are several different ways to perform minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.
Your heart surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch-long cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided so your surgeon can reach the heart. A small cut is made in the left side of your heart so the surgeon can repair or replace the mitral valve. In endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to do the surgery. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about Â½ to Â¾ inch) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the heart and mitral valve on the computer. This method is very precise.
You may or may not need to be on a heart lung machine for these types of surgery, but if not, your heart rate will be slowed by medicine or a mechanical device.
If your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have:
Ring annuloplasty -- The surgeon repairs the ring-like part around the valve by sewing a ring of metal, cloth, or tissue around the valve. Valve repair -- The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or both of the leaflets of the valve. The leaflets are flaps that open and close the valve.
If your mitral valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your mitral valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:
Mechanical -- made of man-made materials, such as titanium, or ceramic. These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological -- made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 - 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.
The surgery may take 2 -4 hours.
This surgery can also be done through a groin artery, with no cuts on your chest. The doctor sends a catheter (flexible tube) with a balloon attached on the end. The balloon stretches the opening of the valve. This procedure is called percutaneous valvuloplasty."
531,Who needs Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"You may need surgery if your mitral valve does not work properly because:
You have mitral regurgitation -- a mitral valve that does not close all the way and allows blood to leak back into the left atria. You have mitral stenosis -- a mitral valve that does not open fully and restricts blood flow. Your valve has developed an infection (infectious endocarditis) You have severe mitral valve prolapse that is not controlled with medications.
Minimally invasive surgery may be done for these reasons:
Changes in your mitral valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fainting spells (syncope), or heart failure. Tests show that the changes in your mitral valve are beginning to seriously affect your heart function. Your heart valve has been damaged by infection (endocarditis).
A minimally invasive procedure has many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk of infection. You will also recover faster than you would from open heart surgery.
Percutaneous valvoplasty is a procedure that is only done in people who are too sick to have anesthesia. The results of this procedure are not long lasting."

533,What are the risks of Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"Risks for any surgery are:
Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs. Blood loss. Breathing problems. Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves. Reactions to medicines.
Minimally invasive surgery techniques have far fewer risks than open surgery. Possible risks from minimally invasive valve surgery are:
Damage to other organs, nerves, or bones. Heart attack, stroke, or death. Infection of the new valve. Irregular heartbeat that must be treated with medicines or a pacemaker. Kidney failure. Poor healing of the wounds."
534,What to expect before Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"Always tell your doctor or nurse:
If you are or could be pregnant What drugs you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.
You may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your surgeon about how you and your family members can donate blood.
For the 2-week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery.
Some of them are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix), talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.
Prepare your house for when you get home from the hospital.
The day before your surgery, shower and shampoo well. You may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest two or three times with this soap. You also may be asked to take an antibiotic to guard against infection.
During the days before your surgery:
Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your doctor for help. Always let your doctor know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your surgery.
On the day of the surgery:
You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes chewing gum and using breath mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry, but be careful not to swallow. Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital."
535,What to expect after Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"Expect to spend 3 - 5 days in the hospital after surgery. You will wake up in the intensive care unit (ICU) and recover there for 1 or 2 days. Nurses will closely watch monitors that show information about your vital signs (pulse, temperature, and breathing).
Two to three tubes will be in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart. They are usually removed 1 - 3 days after surgery. You may have a catheter (flexible tube) in your bladder to drain urine. You may also have intravenous (IV, in a vein) lines to get fluids.
You will go from the ICU to a regular hospital room. Your nurses and doctors will continue to monitor your heart and vital signs until you are stable enough to go home. You will receive pain medicine for pain in your chest.
Your nurse will help you slowly resume some activity. You may begin a program to make your heart and body stronger.
A temporary pacemaker may be placed in your heart if your heart rate becomes too slow after surgery."
536,How is Mitral valve surgery (open) done?,"Before your surgery, you will receive general anesthesia. This will make you asleep and pain-free during the entire procedure.
Your surgeon will make a 10-inch-long cut in the middle of your chest. Next, your surgeon will separate your breastbone to be able to see your heart. Most people are connected to a heart-lung bypass machine or bypass pump. Your heart is stopped while you are connected to this machine. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped. A small cut is made in the left side of your heart so your surgeon can repair or replace the mitral valve.
If your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have:
Ring annuloplasty -- The surgeon repairs the ring-like part around the valve by sewing a ring of metal, cloth, or tissue around the valve. Valve repair -- The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or more of the three leaflets of the valve. The leaflets are flaps that open and close the valve.
If your mitral valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your mitral valve and sew a new one into place. There are two types of mitral valves:
Mechanical -- made of man-made (synthetic) materials, such as a metal like titanium. These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological -- made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.
Once the new or repaired valve is working, your surgeon will:
Close your heart and take you off the heart-lung machine. Place catheters (tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up. Close your breastbone with stainless steel wires. It will take about 6 weeks for the bone to heal. The wires will stay inside your body.
You may have a temporary pacemaker connected to your heart until your natural heart rhythm returns.
Your surgeon may also perform coronary artery bypass surgery at the same time, if needed.
This surgery may take 3 - 6 hours."
537,Who needs Mitral valve surgery (open)?,"You may need surgery if your mitral valve does not work properly.
A mitral valve that does not close all the way will allow blood to leak back into the left atria. This is called mitral regurgitation. A mitral valve that does not open fully will restrict blood flow. This is called mitral stenosis. A valve defect that you have had since birth is called mitral valve prolapse.
You may need open heart surgery for these reasons:
Changes in your mitral valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as angina (chest pain), shortness of breath, fainting spells (syncope), or heart failure. Tests show that the changes in your mitral valve are beginning to seriously affect your heart function. Your doctor may want to replace or repair your mitral valve at the same time as you are having open-heart surgery for another reason. Your heart valve has been damaged by endocarditis (infection of the heart valve). You have received a new heart valve in the past, and it is not working well, or you have other problems such as blood clots, infection, or bleeding."

539,What are the risks of Mitral valve surgery (open)?,"Risks for any surgery are:
Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs. Blood loss. Breathing problems. Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves. Reactions to medicines.
Possible risks from having open-heart surgery are:
Heart attack or stroke. Heart rhythm problems. Infection in the cut, which is more likely to happen in people who are obese, have diabetes, or have already had this surgery. Memory loss and loss of mental clarity, or ""fuzzy thinking."" Post-pericardiotomy syndrome, which is a low-grade fever and chest pain. This could last for up to 6 months."
540,What to expect before Mitral valve surgery (open)?,"Always tell your doctor or nurse:
If you are or could be pregnant. What drugs you are taking, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.
You may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your surgeon how you and your family members can donate blood (autologous donation).
For the 2-week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery.
Some of these drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix), talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.

541,What to expect after Mitral valve surgery (open)?,"Expect to spend 4 to 7 days in the hospital after surgery. You will wake up in the intensive care unit (ICU) and recover there for 1 or 2 days. Two to three tubes will be in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart. They are usually removed 1 to 3 days after surgery.
You may have a flexible tube (catheter) in your bladder to drain urine. You may also have intravenous (IV, in the vein) lines to get fluids. Nurses will closely watch monitors that show information about your vital signs (pulse, temperature, and breathing).
You will be moved to a regular hospital room from the ICU. Your nurses and doctors will continue to monitor your heart and vital signs until you are stable enough to go home. You will receive pain medicine to control pain around your surgical cut.
Your nurse will help you slowly resume some activity. You will be asked to begin a physical therapy program to make your heart and body stronger."
542,What are the symptoms of Myocarditis?,"There may be no symptoms. Symptoms may be similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may include:
A racing heartbeat Chest pain that may resemble a heart attack Fatigue Fever and other signs of a flu -like infection including headache, muscle aches, sore throat, diarrhea, or a rash Joint pain or swelling Leg swelling Shortness of breath
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Fainting, often related to irregular heart rhythms Low urine output"
543,What causes Myocarditis?,"Myocarditis is an uncommon disorder that is usually caused by viral, bacterial, or fungal infections that reach the heart.
Viral infections: Coxsackie B, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis C, Herpes, HIV, Parvovirus Bacterial infections: Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Streptococcus, Treponema Fungal infections: Aspergillus, Candida, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma
When you have an infection, your immune system produces special cells that release chemicals to fight off disease. If the infection affects your heart, the disease-fighting cells enter the heart. However, the chemicals produced by an immune response can damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart can become thick, swollen, and weak. This leads to symptoms of heart failure.
Other causes of myocarditis may include:
Allergic reactions to certain medications or toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs, heavy metals, and catecholamines) Being around certain chemicals Certain diseases that cause inflammation throughout the body (rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis)"
544,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Myocarditis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of myocarditis, especially after a recent infection. Seek immediate medical help if you have severe symptoms or have been diagnosed with myocarditis and have increased:
Chest pain Difficulty breathing Swelling of your extremities"
545,What to expect if I have Myocarditis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,How well you do depends on the cause of the problem and your overall health. The outlook varies. Some people may recover completely. Others may have permanent heart failure.
546,What are the symptoms of Noonan syndrome?,"Symptoms of Noonan syndrome may include:
Physical Appearance: Abnormally shaped or low-set ears Downward slanting eyes Wide-set eyes Extra fold of skin on the inner part of the eye (epicanthal folds) Drooping eyelids (ptosis) Short stature Sinking in or protruding out of the breast bone Short or webbed neck Scoliosis Excess skin on the back of the neck Small penis Undescended testicles
Developmental: Mental retardation Motor problems Speech and language problems Delayed onset of puberty"
547,What are the causes of Noonan syndrome?,Noonan syndrome is caused by the genetic inheritance of several abnormal genes from one or both parents.
548,Who is at highest risk for Noonan syndrome ?,Individuals at highest risk are those who have parents or family members with Noonan syndrome or abnormal/mutated genes associated with Noonan syndrome.
549,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Noonan syndrome ?,Contact your doctor if you feel your infant has symptoms of Noonan syndrome.
550,What to expect if I have Noonan syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis for individuals with Noonan syndrome is typically good. However, it will vary from individual to individual depending on the extent of the abnormalities and types of symptoms present. Talk to your doctor to get a more specific prognosis for your child's condition."
551,What causes Obesity ?,"Taking in more calories than you burn can lead to obesity because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:
Eating more food than your body can use Drinking too much alcohol Not getting enough exercise
Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.
Other factors that affect weight include:
The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults. The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat. We are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active: Many people do not have time to plan and make healthy meals. More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past. People with less free time have less time to exercise.
The term ""eating disorder"" means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.
Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:
Underactive thyroid gland hypothyroidism Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics
Other things that can cause weight gain are:
Quitting smoking. Most people who quit smoking gain 4 - 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting. Some people gain as much as 25 - 30 pounds. Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well For women: Menopause -- women may gain 12-15 pounds during menopause Not losing the weight they gained during pregnancy"
552,What causes Oliguria?,"Dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhea, or fever, with a lack of adequate fluid intake. Total urinary tract obstruction, such as from an enlarged prostate. Severe infection or any other medical condition leading to shock. Use of certain medications such as anticholinergics, methotrexate, and diuretics."
553,Who is at highest risk for Oliguria ?,Patient having any of the conditions mentioned in the causes are at risk of oliguria.
554,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Oliguria ?,"Contact your health care provider if you have:
A noticeable and consistent decrease in urine output. Vomiting, diarrhea, or high fever and are unable to replace fluids by mouth. A decrease in urine output associated with dizziness, lightheadedness, or rapid pulse."
555,What to expect if I have Oliguria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis depends on the cause of oliguria.
556,What causes Breathing difficulty - lying down?,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Cor pulmonale Heart failure Obesity (does not directly cause difficulty breathing while lying down but often aggravates other conditions that lead to it) Panic disorder Sleep apnea Snoring
557,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Orthopnea ?,"If you have any unexplained difficulty in breathing while lying down, call for an appointment with your health care provider."
558,When could I drive after i underwent Pacemaker insertion discharge instructions ?,You should not drive after the procedure without asking your doctor when you could do that. This is different for everyone.
559,What medications should I take after Pacemaker insertion discharge instructions ?,Ask your doctor whether you should go back to taking the medications you were on before the procedure. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking.
560,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and do not take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
561,What precautions should I take?,"Most machines and devices will not interfere with your pacemaker. But some with strong magnetic fields may. Always ask your doctor or nurse about any specific device that you need to avoid. Do not put a magnet near your pacemaker. Most appliances in your home are safe to be around. This includes your refrigerator, washer, dryer, toaster, blender, computers and fax machines, hair dryer, stove, CD player, remote controls, and microwave. You should keep several devices at least 12 inches away from the site where the pacemaker is placed under your skin. These include:
Battery powered cordless tools (such as screwdrivers and drills). Plug-in power tools (such as drills and table saws). Electric lawn mowers and leaf blowers. Slot machines. Stereo speakers.
Tell all health care providers that you have a pacemaker before any tests are done. Some medical equipment may interfere with your pacemaker. Stay away from large motors, generators, and equipment. Do not lean over the open hood of a car that is running. Also stay away from:
Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines. Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers. Large electrical or gasoline powered appliances.
If you have a cell phone:
Do not put it in a pocket on the same side of your body as your pacemaker. When using your cell phone, hold it to your ear on the opposite side of your body.
Be careful around metal detectors and security wands.
Handheld security wands may interfere with your pacemaker. Show your wallet card and ask to be hand searched. Most security gates at airports and stores are okay. But do not stand near these devices for long periods. Your pacemaker may set off alarms.
After any operation, have your doctor check your pacemaker."
562,When may I resume my regular activities?,"Do not use your arm on the side where your pacemaker is inserted to lift, push or pull anything weighing more than five pounds, at least for the first 6 weeks. You may do the daily activities like face washing, hair combing, tooth brushing. You should avoid swimming, playing golf or playing tennis after the procedure."
563,When can I go back to work after Pacemaker insertion discharge instructions ?,It depends on the type of your work. You can ask your doctor when you can go back to work.
564,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pacemaker insertion discharge instructions ?,"Call your doctor if:
Your wound looks infected (redness, increased drainage, swelling, painful). You are having the symptoms you had before the pacemaker was implanted. You feel dizzy or short of breath. You have chest pain. You have hiccups that do not go away. You were unconscious for a moment."
565,What are the symptoms of Palpitation?,"Normally the heart beats 60 - 100 times per minute. In people who exercise routinely or take medications that slow the heart, the rate may drop below 55 beats per minute.
If your heart rate is fast (over 100 beats per minute), this is called tachycardia. A slow heart rate is called bradycardia. An occasional extra heartbeat is known as extrasystole.
Palpitations are usually not serious. However, it depends on whether or not the sensations represent an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia).
The following conditions make you more likely to have an abnormal heart rhythm:
Known heart disease at the time the palpitations begin Significant risk factors for heart disease An abnormal heart valve An electrolyte abnormality in your blood (for example, a low potassium level)"
566,What causes Palpitation?,"Heart palpitations can be caused by:
Anemia Anxiety, stress, fear Caffeine Certain medications, including those used to treat thyroid disease, asthma, high blood pressure, or heart problems Cocaine Diet pills Exercise Fever Hyperventilation Low levels of oxygen in your blood Heart valve disease, including mitral valve prolapse Nicotine Overactive thyroid"
567,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Palpitation ?,"Call 911 if:
You lose and regain consciousness. Someone with you loses consciousness. You have shortness of breath, chest pain, unusual sweating, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
Call your doctor right away if:
You feel frequent extra heartbeats (more than 6 per minute or coming in groups of 3 or more). You have risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol, diabetes, or high blood pressure. You have new or different heart palpitations. Your pulse is more than 100 beats per minute (without exercise, anxiety, or fever)."
568,What are the symptoms of Patent ductus arteriosus?,"Infants with patent ductus arteriosus may have symptoms such as:
Bounding pulse Fast breathing Poor feeding habits Shortness of breath Sweating while feeding Fatigue Poor growth
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
569,Who is at highest risk for Patent ductus arteriosus ?,"Like many congenital heart disease, the cause of patent ductus arteriosus is not clear. Clinical studies suggest that the genetic and environmental factors both play an important role during the pregnancy.
Genetic disorders such as Down syndrome Pregnant woman had German measles during pregnancy"
570,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Patent ductus arteriosus ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has patent ductus arteriosus and symptoms do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms appear. If your baby experiences either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Shortnesss of breath Hemoptysis"
571,What to expect if I have Patent ductus arteriosus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of patent ductus arteriosus varies widely. It depends on:
The size of patent ductus arteriosus Whether the patient has been treated with closure medicines. Whether surgery has been done. Whether the patient with complications or not, such as heart failure, problems with lung development, or infective endocarditis."
572,What are the symptoms of Patent foramen ovale?,Infants with a patent foramen ovale and no other heart defects usually do not have symptoms.
573,What causes Patent foramen ovale?,"While a fetus grows in the uterus, its lungs are not functional. The foramen ovale allows blood to bypass the lungs so it does not cause issues in the fetus. The opening is supposed to close soon after birth, but sometimes it does not. In about 1 out of 4 people, the opening never closes. If it does not, it is called a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The cause of a patent foramen ovale is unknown."
574,Who is at highest risk for Patent foramen ovale ?,There are no known risk factors.
575,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Patent foramen ovale ?,"Mostly patent foramen ovale stays asymptomatic. In case of development of weakness of any part of body (stroke), seek urgent care."
576,What to expect if I have Patent foramen ovale  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The infant will have normal health in the absence of other heart defects.
577,What causes Pedal edema?,"Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common with the following situations:
Being overweight Blood clot in the leg Increased age Leg infection Veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.
Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.
Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia (also called toxemia), a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.
Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.
Certain medications may also cause your legs to swell:
Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors (such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine) and tricyclics (such as nortriptyline, desipramine, and amitriptyline) Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine, amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, and verapamil) Hormones like estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone Steroids."
578,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pedal edema ?,"Call 911 if:
You feel short of breath. You have chest pain, especially if it feels like pressure or tightness. Call your doctor right away if: You have heart disease or kidney disease and the swelling gets worse. You have a history of liver disease and now have swelling in your legs or abdomen. Your swollen foot or leg is red or warm to the touch. You have a fever. You are pregnant and have more than just mild swelling or have a sudden increase in swelling. Also call your doctor if self-care measures do not help or swelling gets worse."
579,Who needs Percutaneous coronary intervention?,"Percutaneous coronary intervention is used to restore blood flow to the heart when the coronary (heart) arteries have become narrowed or blocked because of coronary heart disease (CHD).
Percutaneous coronary intervention is one of a number of treatments for CHD. Other treatments include medicines and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Your doctor will consider many factors when deciding what treatment or combination of treatments to recommend.
Compared with CABG, some advantages of percutaneous coronary intervention are that it:
Doesn't require an incision (cut) Doesn't require general anesthesia (that is, you won't be temporarily put to sleep during the procedure) Has a shorter recovery time
Percutaneous coronary intervention also is used as an emergency procedure during a heart attack. As plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, it can rupture. This can cause a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface and block blood flow. The lack of oxygen-rich blood to the heart can damage the heart muscle.
Quickly opening a blockage lessens the damage during a heart attack by restoring blood flow to the heart muscle. Percutaneous coronary intervention usually is the fastest way to open a blocked artery and is the best approach during a heart attack.
A disadvantage of percutaneous coronary intervention, when compared with CABG, is that the artery more frequently renarrows over time. However, the risk of this happening is lower when stents are used, especially stents coated with medicines (drug-eluting stents).
Stents are small mesh tubes that support the inner artery wall. They reduce the chance of the artery becoming narrowed or blocked again. Some stents are coated with medicines that are slowly and continuously released into the artery. The medicines help prevent the artery from becoming blocked again. However, stents aren't without risks. In some cases, blood clots can form in stents and cause a heart attack.
Your doctor will talk to you about your treatment options and which procedure is best for you."
580,How is Percutaneous coronary intervention performed?,"Before the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure begins, you will be given some pain medicine. You may also be given blood thinning medicines to prevent a blood clot from forming.
You will lie on a padded table. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube (catheter) through a surgical cut into an artery. Sometimes the catheter will be placed in your arm or wrist. You will be awake during the procedure.
The doctor will use live x-ray pictures to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart and arteries. Dye will be injected into your body to highlight blood flow through the arteries. This helps the doctor see any blockages in the blood vessels that lead to your heart.
A guide wire is moved into and across the blockage. A balloon catheter is pushed over the guide wire and into the blockage. The balloon on the end is blown up (inflated). This opens the blocked vessel and restores proper blood flow to the heart.
A wire mesh tube (stent) may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open.
The stent may be coated with a drug (called a drug-eluting stent). This type of stent may lower the chance of the artery closing back up in the future. However, drug-eluting stents are slightly more likely to close in the short-term. Currently, they are only used for certain patients."
581,Why is the procedure performed?,"Arteries can become narrowed or blocked by deposits called plaque. Plaque is made up of fat and cholesterol that builds up on the inside of the artery walls. This condition is called atherosclerosis.
Percutaneous coronary intervention may be used to treat:
Blockage in a coronary artery during or after a heart attack Blockage of one or more coronary arteries that puts you at risk for a heart attack Persistent chest pain (angina) that medicines do not control
Not every blockage can be treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Some patients who have several blockages or blockages in certain locations may need coronary bypass surgery."
582,Where to find centers that do Percutaneous coronary intervention?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Percutaneous coronary intervention
583,What are the risks of Percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement?,"Percutaneous coronary intervention is a common medical procedure. Serious complications don't occur often. However, they can happen no matter how careful your doctor is or how well he or she does the procedure.
Serious complications include:
Bleeding from the blood vessel where the catheters were inserted. Blood vessel damage from the catheters. An allergic reaction to the dye given during the percutaneous coronary intervention. An arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). The need for emergency coronary bypass surgery during the procedure (2–4 percent of people). This may occur if an artery closes down instead of opening up. Damage to the kidneys caused by the dye used. Heart attack (3–5 percent of people). Stroke (less than 1 percent of people).
Sometimes chest pain can occur during percutaneous coronary intervention because the balloon briefly blocks blood supply to the heart.
As with any procedure involving the heart, complications can sometimes, though rarely, cause death. Less than 2 percent of people die during percutaneous coronary intervention.
Complications from stents include:
After percutaneous coronary intervention, the treated coronary artery can become narrowed or blocked again, often within 6 months of percutaneous coronary intervention. This is called restenosis.
Studies suggest that there's a higher risk of blood clots forming in medicine-coated stents compared to bare metal stents. However, no conclusive evidence shows that these stents increase the chances of having a heart attack or dying, if used as recommended.
The risk of complications is higher in:
People aged 75 and older People who have kidney disease or diabetes Women People who have poor pumping function in their hearts People who have extensive heart disease and blockages in their coronary (heart) arteries"
584,What to expect before Percutaneous coronary intervention?,"Cardiologists do coronary angioplasties at hospitals. Cardiologists are doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.
If your percutaneous coronary intervention isn't done as an emergency treatment, you'll meet with your cardiologist before the procedure. He or she will go over your medical history (including the medicines you take), do a physical exam, and talk to you about the procedure.
Your doctor also may recommend some routine tests, such as blood tests, an EKG (electrocardiogram), and a chest x ray.
Once the percutaneous coronary intervention is scheduled, your doctor will advise you:
When to begin fasting (not eating or drinking) before the procedure. Often you have to stop eating and drinking by midnight the night before the procedure. What medicines you should and shouldn't take on the day of the percutaneous coronary intervention. When to arrive at the hospital and where to go.
Even though percutaneous coronary intervention takes only 1 to 2 hours, you'll likely need to stay in the hospital overnight or longer. Your doctor may advise you not to drive for a certain amount of time after the procedure, so you may have to arrange for a ride home."
585,What to expect after Percutaneous coronary intervention?,"After percutaneous coronary intervention, you'll be moved to a special care unit. You'll stay there for a few hours or overnight. You must lie still for a few hours to allow the blood vessel in your arm or groin (upper thigh) to seal completely.
While you recover, nurses will check your heart rate and blood pressure. They also will check your arm or groin for bleeding. After a few hours, you'll be able to walk with help.
The place where the catheters (tubes) were inserted may feel sore or tender for about a week.
Going Home:
Most people go home the day after the procedure. When your doctor thinks you're ready to leave the hospital, you'll get instructions to follow at home, such as:
How much activity or exercise you can do. When you should follow up with your doctor. What medicines you should take. What you should look for daily when checking for signs of infection around the area where the tube was inserted. Signs of infection may include redness, swelling, or drainage. When you should call your doctor. For example, you may need to call if you have shortness of breath; a fever; or signs of infection, pain, or bleeding where the tubes were inserted. When you should call 9–1–1 (for example, if you have any chest pain).
Your doctor will prescribe medicine to prevent blood clots from forming after the procedure such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) or prasugrel (Efient). Taking your medicine as directed is very important. If you got a stent during percutaneous coronary intervention, the medicine reduces the risk that blood clots will form in the stent. Blood clots in the stent can block blood flow and cause a heart attack.
DO NOT STOP TAKING THEM WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. Stopping these medications too soon can be life-threatening.
Recovery and Recuperation:
Most people recover from percutaneous coronary intervention and return to work about 1 week after leaving the hospital. Your doctor will want to check your progress after you leave the hospital. During the follow-up visit, your doctor will examine you, make changes to your medicines (if needed), do any necessary tests, and check your overall recovery.
Use this time to ask questions you may have about activities, medicines, or lifestyle changes, or to talk about any other issues that concern you.
Lifestyle Changes:
Although percutaneous coronary intervention can reduce the symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD), it isn't a cure for CHD or the risk factors that led to it. Making healthy lifestyle changes can help treat CHD and maintain the good results from percutaneous coronary intervention.
Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for CHD and the lifestyle changes you'll need to make. For some people, these changes may be the only treatment needed.
Lifestyle changes may include changing your diet, quitting smoking, doing physical activity regularly, losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing stress. You also should take all of your medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes."
586,What are the symptoms of Pericarditis?,"Chest pain is almost always present, which is caused by the inflamed pericardium rubbing against the heart. The pain:
May be felt in the neck, shoulder, back, or abdomen. Often increases with deep breathing and lying flat, and may increase with coughing and swallowing. Patients may often feel better sitting up and leaning forward. Can be a sharp, stabbing pleuritic type pain (pleuritis).
Fever, chills, or sweating if the condition is caused by an infection. Ankle, feet, and leg swelling (occasionally if there is a constriction of the heart filling in a condition known as constrictive pericarditis). Anxiety Breathing difficulty when lying down (orthopnea) Dry cough Fatigue"
587,What causes Pericarditis?,"The cause of pericarditis is often unknown or unproven, but is often the result of an infection such as:
Viral infections that cause a chest cold or pneumonia, such as the echovirus or coxsackie virus (which are common in children), as well as influenza Infections with bacteria (much less common) Some fungal infections (even more rare)
In addition, pericarditis may be seen with diseases such as:
Cancer (including leukemia) Disorders in which the immune system attacks healthy body tissue by mistake HIV infection and AIDS Underactive thyroid gland Kidney failure Rheumatic fever Tuberculosis (TB)
Other causes include:
Heart attack Heart surgery or trauma to the chest, esophagus, or heart Certain medications, such as procainamide, hydralazine, phenytoin, isoniazid, and some drugs used to treat cancer or suppress the immune system Swelling or inflammation of the heart muscle Radiation therapy to the chest"
588,Who is at highest risk for Pericarditis ?,Pericarditis most often affects men aged 20 - 50. It usually follows respiratory infections.
589,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pericarditis ?,"Pericarditis can be potentially life threatening and one should seek medical care when suffering from symptoms of pericarditis. Severe chest pain, fainting, palpitations and high grade fever may be signs of a build up of fluids within the pericardium, which is referred to as a cardiac tamponade. A cardiac tamponade is a condition in which the heart cannot expand to accept blood."
590,What to expect if I have Pericarditis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Pericarditis can range from mild cases that get better on their own to life-threatening cases. The condition can be complicated by fluid buildup around the heart and poor heart function.
The outcome is good if the disorder is treated right away. Most people recover in 2 weeks to 3 months. However, pericarditis may come back. This is called recurrent, or chronic if symptoms or episodes continue.
Scarring and thickening of the sac-like covering of the heart muscle may occur in severe cases. This is called constrictive pericarditis, and it can cause long-term problems similar to those of heart failure."
591,When could I drive after i underwent Peripheral angioplasty discharge instructions ?,You should not drive for 48 hours after the procedure.
592,What medications should I take after Peripheral angioplasty discharge instructions ?,"Aspirin every day. Ask your doctor about the dose you should take. Plavix (clopidogrel) may be used in addition to Aspirin to decrease the risk of a blood clot forming in the artery.
You will be given a list of all medicines you should take once you are at home. Ask your doctor whether you should go back to take the medications you were on before the procedure. Be sure your doctor knows about everything you are taking."
593,Should I take any OTC pain medications?,"You may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) every six hours as needed for pain in the area where the catheter was placed. Please be sure you are not taking more than one product containing acetaminophen, and do not take more Tylenol than what is recommended on the label."
594,When may I resume my regular activities?,"You may resume your regular activities one week after the procedure. Avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than 10 pounds in the first week after the procedure. Also avoid any exercise that causes you to hold your breath and bear down with your abdominal muscles."
595,When could I bathe or swim?,"Usually after one week, when the puncture site is healed. This usually takes about a week. You may shower on the day after the procedure after removing the Band-Aid over your puncture site."
596,When can I go back to work after Peripheral angioplasty discharge instructions ?,It depends on the type of your work. you can ask your doctor when you can go back to work.
597,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Peripheral angioplasty discharge instructions ?,"Call your doctor or nurse if:
There is swelling at the catheter site. There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when pressure is applied. Your leg below where the catheter was inserted changes color or becomes cool to the touch, pale, or numb. The small incision from your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. Your legs are swelling. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. You have chills or a fever over 101 °F. You develop weakness in your body or are unable to get out of bed."
598,What are the symptoms of Peripheral arterial disease?,"The classic symptoms are pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. These symptoms usually appear during walking or exercise and go away after several minutes of rest.
At first, these symptoms may appear only when you walk uphill, walk faster, or walk for longer distances. Slowly, these symptoms come on more quickly and with less exercise. Your legs or feet may feel numb when you are at rest. The legs also may feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale.
When peripheral artery disease becomes severe, you may have:
Impotence Pain and cramps at night Pain or tingling in the feet or toes, which can be so severe that even the weight of clothes or bed sheets is painful Pain that is worse when you raise the leg and improves when you dangle your legs over the side of the bed Skin that looks dark and blue Sores that do not heal"
599,What causes Peripheral arterial disease?,"Peripheral artery disease is caused by arteriosclerosis, or ""hardening of the arteries."" This problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries. This causes the arteries to become narrower. The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed.
As a result, when the muscles of your legs are working harder (such as during exercise or walking) they cannot get enough blood and oxygen. Eventually, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting.
Peripheral artery disease is a common disorder that usually affects men over age 50."
600,Who is at highest risk for Peripheral arterial disease ?,"People are at higher risk if they have a history of:
Abnormal cholesterol Diabetes Heart disease (coronary artery disease) High blood pressure (hypertension) Kidney disease involving hemodialysis Smoking Stroke (cerebrovascular disease)"
601,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Peripheral arterial disease ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
A leg or foot that becomes cool to the touch, pale, blue, or numb Chest pain or shortness of breath with leg pain Leg pain that does not go away, even when you are not walking or moving (called rest pain) Legs that are red, hot, or swollen New sores/ ulcers Signs of infection (fever, redness, general ill feeling) Symptoms of arteriosclerosis of the extremities"
602,What to expect if I have Peripheral arterial disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"You can usually control peripheral artery disease of the legs without surgery. Surgery provides good symptom relief in severe cases.
For complications, the affected leg or foot may need to be amputated."
603,What are the symptoms of persistent left superior vena cava?,"The signs and symptoms depends on where the left superior vena cava flows to. If it finally flows to right atria, patients may have no sign or aymptom. But if the left superior vena cava flows to flows to left atria, symptoms may include anoxemia, such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness and shortness of breath."
604,Who is at highest risk for Persistent left superior vena cava ?,The cause of persistent left superior vena cava is not clear. Some patients with persistent left superior vena cava have other congenital heart disease.
605,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Persistent left superior vena cava ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has symptoms of persistent left superior vena cava. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Shortness of breath"
606,How to know you have persistent left superior vena cava?,"Echocardiography: This kind of painless test can help the doctor closely examine persistent left superior vena cava. It uses sound waves to produce an image of the ventricles, atrium and great vessles. Echocardiogram can tell whether left superior vena cava flows to right areia or not. Further more, the doctor can measure the speed of blood flow by echocardiogram. Chest x-ray: An x-ray image of chest allows the doctor to check the size and shape of your great vessles and heart. Chest CT or MRI: A chest CT or MRI can demonstrate the details of the heart extremely well, such as the great vessles, vascular, atrial and ventricular structures and their relationships to one another. Cardiac catheterization: This is not a common diagnostic measure for persistent left superior vena cava. In a catheter room, the doctor threads a thin tube through a blood vessel in the patient's arm or groin to an artery in the heart and injects dye to see great vessles, atria and ventricles on an x-ray. Cardiac catheterization can reveal associated cardiac abnormalities are known or suspected."
607,What to expect if I have Persistent left superior vena cava  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of persistent left superior vena cava depends upon where the left superior vena cava flows to. The prognosis of a persistent left superior vena cava that flows to left atria is worse than that if it flows to the right atria.
608,What are the symptoms of Persistent truncus arteriosus ?,Bluish skin (cyanosis) Delayed growth or growth failure Fatigue Lethargy Poor feeding Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Widening of the finger tips (clubbing)
609,What causes Persistent truncus arteriosus ?,"In normal circulation, the pulmonary artery comes out of the right ventricle and the aorta comes out of the left ventricle, which are separate from each other. Coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart muscle) come out of the aorta just above the valve at the entrance of the aorta.
In truncus arteriosus, a single artery comes out of the ventricles. There is usually also a large hole between the two ventricles (ventricular septal defect). As a result, the blue (without oxygen) and red (oxygen-rich) blood mix.
Some of this mixed blood goes to the lungs, some goes to the coronary arteries, and the rest goes to the body. Usually, too much blood is sent to the lungs.
If this condition is not treated, two problems occur:
Too much blood circulation in the lungs may cause extra fluid to build up in and around them, making it difficult to breathe. The blood vessels to the lungs become permanently damaged. Over time, it becomes very hard for the heart to force blood to them. This is called pulmonary hypertension and it can be life-threatening."
610,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Persistent truncus arteriosus ?,"Call your health care provider if your infant or child:
Appears lethargic Appears overly tired or mildly short of breath Does not eat well Does not seem to be growing or developing normally
If the skin, lips, or nail beds look blue or if the child seems to be very short of breath, take the child to the emergency room or have the child examined promptly."
611,What to expect if I have Persistent truncus arteriosus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Complete repair usually provides good results. Another procedure may be needed as the patient grows. Untreated cases result in death, often during the first year of life."
612,What are the symptoms of Pleural effusion?,"Chest pain, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breaths. Cough Fever Hiccups Rapid breathing Shortness of breath
Sometimes there are no symptoms."
613,What causes Pleural effusion?,"Your body produces pleural fluid in small amounts to lubricate the surfaces of the pleura, the thin tissue that lines the chest cavity and surrounds the lungs. A pleural effusion is an abnormal, excessive collection of this fluid.
Two different types of effusions can develop:
Transudative pleural effusions are caused by fluid leaking into the pleural space. This is caused by increased pressure in, or low protein content in, the blood vessels. Congestive heart failure is the most common cause. Exudative effusions are caused by blocked blood vessels, inflammation, lung injury, and drug reactions."
614,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pleural effusion ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of pleural effusion. Call your provider or go to the emergency room if shortness of breath or difficulty breathing occurs immediately after thoracentesis.
615,What to expect if I have Pleural effusion  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The expected outcome depends upon the underlying disease.
616,What are the symptoms of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome?,"Symptoms of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome can include:
Increase in heart rate from supine to upright position of more than 30bpm or to a heart rate of 120 bpm within 10 minutes of standing Decrease in blood pressure which can lead to: Lightheadedness Syncope (fainting) Exercise intolerance Fatigue Poor blood flow to the organs and upper parts of the body which can lead to: Cold hands Chest pain Muscle weakness Shortness of breath Headache Vision problems Brain fog Depression Anomia (word finding problems) Difficulty concentrating Difficulty sleeping Gastrointestinal symptoms Stomach pain Constipation Diarrhea Bloating Nausea Vomiting Inappropriate levels of hormones Chills Fear Sweating Feeling nervous"
617,What are the causes of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome?,"The cause of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome remains unknown. However, most people develop POTS in their teenage years and see a gradual improvement in their mid-twenties. Others develop Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after:
Viral infections Bacterial infections Mononucleosis Pneumonia Trauma or injury After or during pregnancy"
618,Who is at highest risk for Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ?,Women ages 15-20 years old.
619,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ?,Call or make an appointment with you doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of POTS
620,What to expect if I have Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis is good for about 80% of patients. Usually within a few years symptoms will begin to lessen although many people can experience cyclic relapses of symptoms over a period of time.
621,What are the symptoms of Pre eclampsia?,"Often, women who are diagnosed with preeclampsia do not feel sick.
Symptoms of preeclampsia can include:
Swelling of the hands and face/eyes (edema) Weight gain More than 2 pounds per week Sudden weight gain over 1 - 2 days
(Note: Some swelling of the feet and ankles is considered normal with pregnancy.)
Symptoms of more severe preeclampsia:
Headaches that are dull or throbbing and will not go away Abdominal pain, mostly felt on the right side, underneath the ribs. Pain may also be felt in the right shoulder and can be confused with heartburn, gallbladder pain, a stomach virus, or the baby kicking. Agitation Decreased urine output, not urinating very often Nausea and vomiting (worrisome sign) Vision changes: temporary loss of vision, sensations of flashing lights, auras, light sensitivity, spots, and blurry vision"
622,What causes Pre eclampsia?,"The exact cause of preeclampsia is not known.
Possible causes include:
Autoimmune disorders Blood vessel problems Diet Genes
Preeclampsia occurs in a small percentage of pregnancies."
623,Who is at highest risk for Pre-eclampsia ?,"Risk factors include:
First pregnancy Multiple pregnancy (twins or more) Obesity Older than age 35 Past history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease"
624,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pre-eclampsia ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of preeclampsia during your pregnancy.
625,What to expect if I have Pre-eclampsia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Usually the high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and other effects of preeclampsia go away completely within 6 weeks after delivery. However, sometimes the high blood pressure will get worse in the first several days after delivery.
A woman with a history of preeclampsia is at risk for the condition again during future pregnancies. Often, it is not as severe in later pregnancies.
Women who have high blood pressure problems during more than one pregnancy have an increased risk for high blood pressure when they get older.
Death of the mother due to preeclampsia is rare in the U.S. The infant's risk of death depends on the severity of the preeclampsia and how prematurely the baby is born."
626,What are the symptoms of Amyloidosis?,"Symptoms depend on the organs affected by the deposits. These organs can include the tongue, intestines, skeletal and smooth muscles, nerves, skin, ligaments, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Symptoms include:
Abnormal heart rhythm (arrythmia) Enlarged tongue Fatigue Numbness of hands and feet Shortness of breath Skin changes Swallowing problems Swelling in the arms and legs Weak hand grip Weight loss
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Decreased urine output Diarrhea Hoarseness or changing voice Joint pain Weakness"
627,What causes Amyloidosis?,"The cause of primary amyloidosis is unknown. The condition is related to abnormal and excess production of antibodies by a type of immune cell called plasma cells.
Primary amyloidosis can lead to conditions that include:
Carpal tunnel syndrome Heart muscle damage (cardiomyopathy) leading to congestive heart failure Intestinal malabsorption Liver enlargement Kidney failure Nephrotic syndrome Neuropathy (nerves that do not work properly) Orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure with standing)
The deposits build up in the affected organs, causing them to become stiff, which decreases their ability to function."
628,Who is at highest risk for Primary amyloidosis ?,"Risk factors have not been identified. Primary amyloidosis is rare. It is similar to multiple myeloma, and is treated the same way."
629,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Primary amyloidosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of primary amyloidosis. You know you have primary amyloidosis and you have difficulty breathing, persistent swelling of the ankles or other areas, decreased urine output, or other symptoms that may indicate complications have developed."
630,What to expect if I have Primary amyloidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How severe the disease is depends on the organs that are affected. When the heart and kidney are involved, it may lead to organ failure and death. Body-wide (systemic) involvement can lead to death in 1 to 3 years."
631,What are the symptoms of Pulmonary atresia?,"Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life. Symptoms may include:
Cyanosis Shortness of breath Fast breathing Poor eating habits Fatigue
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
632,What causes Pulmonary atresia?,"As with most congenital heart diseases, there is no known cause of pulmonary atresia. The condition is associated with another type of congenital heart defect called a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
Persons with pulmonary atresia may also have a poorly developed tricuspid valve. They may also have an underdeveloped right ventricle and abnormal blood vessels feeding the heart.
Pulmonary atresia may occur with or without a ventricular septal defect (VSD). If the person does not have a VSD, the condition is called pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS). If the person has both problems, the condition is called pulmonary atresia with VSD. This is an extreme form of tetralogy of Fallot. Although both conditions are called pulmonary atresia, they are actually different defects."
633,Who is at highest risk for Pulmonary atresia ?,"Like other congenital heart diseases, the cause of pulmonary atresia is not clear. Pulmonary atresia sometimes is associated with other congenital heare diseases such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot."
634,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pulmonary atresia ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has symptoms of pulmonary atresia. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Shortness of breath Cyanosis"
635,What to expect if I have Pulmonary atresia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases can be helped with surgery. However, prognosis depends on how well a baby does depends on:
Quality of the blood vessels supplying the heart How well the heart is beating Amount of leakiness of the other heart valves The severity of other associated congenital heart diseases Whether corrective surgery has been done or not
Outcomes can vary because of the different forms of this defect. The baby could have only a single catheter-based procedure, or could need three or more surgeries and have only a single working ventricle. The outcome is difficult to predict without knowing all details about the patient's condition."
636,What are the symptoms of Pulmonary edema?,"Anxiety Cough Difficulty breathing Excessive sweating Feeling of ""air hunger"" or "" drowning "" (if this occurs suddenly, awakening you from sleep and causing you to sit up and catch your breath, it's called "" paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea "") Grunting or gurgling sounds with breathing Pale skin Restlessness Shortness of breath Shortness of breath when lying down (orthopnea) -- you may need to sleep with your head propped up or use extra pillows Wheezing
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this condition:
Coughing up blood or bloody froth Decrease in level of alertness (consciousness) Inability to speak in full sentences Nasal flaring"
637,What causes Pulmonary edema?,"Pulmonary edema is usually caused by heart failure.
As the heart fails, pressure in the veins going through the lungs starts to rise. As the pressure in these blood vessels increases, fluid is pushed into the air spaces (alveoli) in the lungs. This fluid interrupts normal oxygen movement through the lungs, resulting in shortness of breath.
Pulmonary edema may be caused by damage directly to the lung, such as that caused by poisonous gas or severe infection, as a side effect of medications, or the result of major trauma. Lung damage with a buildup of body fluid is also seen in kidney failure. Exercising at very high altitudes can also cause pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary edema may also be a complication of a heart attack, leaking or narrowed heart valves (mitral or aortic valves), or any disease of the heart that results in weakening or stiffening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)."
638,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pulmonary edema ?,Go to the emergency room or call 911 if you have breathing problems.
639,What to expect if I have Pulmonary edema  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some patients may need to use a breathing machine for a long time, which may lead to damage to lung tissue.
Kidney failure and damage to other major organs may occur if blood and oxygen flow are not restored promptly. If not treated, this condition can be fatal."
640,What are the symptoms of pulmonary embolism?,"Signs and symptoms vary from person to person. However, the common symptoms are:
Chest Pain Under the breastbone or towards one side May feel sharp or stabbing May also be described as a burning, aching, or dull, heavy sensation May get worse with deep breathing, coughing, eating, or bending May cause you to bend over and hold your chest due to the pain
Sudden cough May cough up blood or bloody mucus
Rapid heart rate
Shortness of breath that starts suddenly
Other symptoms that may occur are:
Anxiety or feeling of panic Bluish skin discoloration (cyanosis) Clammy skin Dizziness Leg pain, redness, and swelling Lightheadedness or fainting Low blood pressure Sweating Wheezing"
641,What causes a pulmonary embolism?,"A pulmonary embolism is most often caused by a blood clot in a vein in the leg or in the pelvis (hip area), which breaks off and travels to block an artery in the lung. The most common cause is a blood clot in a deep vein of the thighs. This type of clot is called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Less common causes of a pulmonary embolism include air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, parasites or tumor cells, all of which may lead to a blockage of an artery in the lung.
Risk factors for a pulmonary embolism include:
Burns Cancer Childbirth Family history of blood clots Fractures of the hips or thigh bone Heart attack Heart surgery Long-term bed rest or staying in one position for a long time, such as a long plane or car ride Severe injury Stroke Surgery (especially orthopedic or neurological surgery) Use of birth control pills or estrogen therapy
People with certain clotting disorders also have a higher risk for developing a pulmonary embolism."
642,Who is at highest risk for Pulmonary embolism ?,"Certain conditions carry a significantly increased risk of pulmonary embolism. These conditions are:
Thrombophilias are a group of conditions in which blood has an increased tendency to clot. Thrombophilias can be inherited or acquired. Acquired thrombophilias occur in association with other medical conditions such as polycythemia vera or antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome.
These are other conditions which also increase one's risk of having a PE: Pregnancy Obesity Smoking Cancer Heart failure Previous PE Medications such as oral contraceptive pills, tamoxifen, and hormone replacement therapy."
643,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pulmonary embolism ?,"Pulmonary embolism can be potentially life threatening and one should seek medical care when suffering from symptoms of Pulmonary embolism such as severe sharp chest pain, shortness of breath, blood in sputum, and a raised heart rate."
644,What to expect if I have Pulmonary embolism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"It is hard to predict the outlook of a person recovering from a pulmonary embolism. It will depend on the cause of the initial problem, such as cancer, major surgery, or an injury.
Death is possible in people with a severe pulmonary embolism."
645,What are the symptoms of Pulmonary hypertension?,"Shortness of breath or light-headedness during activity is often the first symptom.
Fast heart rate (palpitations) may be present. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest Other symptoms include:
Ankle and leg swelling Bluish color of the lips or skin (cyanosis) Chest pain or pressure, usually in the front of the chest Dizziness or fainting spells Fatigue Weakness
People with pulmonary hypertension may report good days and bad days."
646,What causes Pulmonary hypertension?,"The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it can receive oxygen. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lung become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, the right side of the heart may become enlarged. At some point, not enough blood flows to the lungs to pick up oxygen and symptoms begin. At this point, heart failure that involves the right side of the heart is present. This is called cor pulmonale.
Pumonary hypertension may be caused by:
Any condition that causes chronic low oxygen levels in the blood Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis Certain birth defects of the heart Certain diet medications Congestive heart failure History of a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) HIV infection Lung or heart valve disease Obstructive sleep apnea
In many cases the cause is unknown, in which case the condition is known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). IPAH is rare. It affects more women than men.
If it is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension."
647,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pulmonary hypertension ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You begin to develop shortness of breath when you are active Shortness of breath worsens You develop chest pain You develop other symptoms"
648,What to expect if I have Pulmonary hypertension  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The long-term outlook has been poor, but new therapies may produce better results. Some people with this condition may develop progressive heart failure that may lead to death.
Avoiding pregnancy is recommended."
649,What are the symptoms of Pulmonary valve stenosis?,"Abdominal distention Bluish coloration to the skin (cyanosis) in some patients Chest pain Fainting Fatigue Poor weight gain or failure to thrive in infants with severe blockage Shortness of breath Sudden death
Note: Patients with mild to moderate blockage may not have any symptoms. There may be no symptoms until the disorder is severe. Symptoms, when present, may get worse with exercise or activity."
650,What causes Pulmonary valve stenosis?,"Narrowing in the pulmonary valve is usually present at birth (congenital). It is caused by a problem that occurs when the unborn baby (fetus) is developing. The cause is unknown, but genetics may play a role.
Narrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called pulmonary valve stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or just after the valve. The defect may occur alone or with other congenital heart defects. The condition can be mild or severe.
Pulmonary valve stenosis is a rare disorder."
651,Who is at highest risk for Pulmonary valve stenosis ?,"As with any congenital heart disease, patients with a family history of pulmonary valve stenosis are at highest risk."
652,How to know you have Pulmonary valve stenosis?,"Narrowing in the pulmonary valve is usually present at birth (congenital). It is caused by a problem that occurs when the unborn baby (fetus) is developing. The cause is unknown, but genetics may play a role.Narrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called pulmonary valve stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or just after the valve. The defect may occur alone or with other congenital heart defects. The condition can be mild or severe. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a rare disorder."
653,What to expect if I have Pulmonary valve stenosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"About one-third of patients with mild stenosis get better, one-third stay the same, and one-third get worse. The outcome is good with successful surgery or balloon dilation. Other congenital heart defects may be a factor in the outlook.
Some valves can last for decades. Others wear out and will need to be replaced."
654,What are the symptoms of Pulmonic regurgitation?,"Mild cases usually do not cause any symptoms. Because pulmonic regurgitation is the result of other factors in the body, any noticeable symptoms are ultimately caused by an underlying medical condition rather than the regurgitation itself. However, more severe regurgitation may contribute to right ventricular hypertrophy, and in later stages, right heart failure. Diastolic Murmur - Early decresendo murmur. Heard best at the left lower sternal border."
655,What causes an Pulmonic regurgitation?,"Pulmonary hypertension is the most common cause of excessive pulmonic regurgitation. Other possible causes include tetralogy of Fallot, infective endocarditis, and congenital absence of the pulmonary valve, carcinoid syndrome."
656,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pulmonic regurgitation ?,"Contact a medical professional when symptoms of breathlessness, fast heart beats, swelling in legs and other parts of body are there"
657,What are the symptoms of Pulseless electrical activity?,"Absence of palpable pulses is the main finding. Depending upon the cause, the following might be found:
Tracheal deviation in or the unilateral absence of breath sounds in tension pneumothorax Decreased skin turgor Traumatic chest Cool extremities Tachycardia Cyanosis"
658,What causes Pulseless electrical activity?,"Common causes of PEA include preceding respiratory failure in 40% to 50% of cases, and hypovolemia. The common causes of PEA can be remembered using the mnemonic ""The Hs and Ts"".
H ypovolemia H ypoxia H ydrogen ions (Acidosis) H ypothermia H yperkalemia or H ypokalemia H ypoglycemia T ablets or T oxins (Drug overdose) such as beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, or calcium channel blockers T amponade T ension pneumothorax T hrombosis (Myocardial infarction) T hrombosis (Pulmonary embolism) T rauma (Hypovolemia from blood loss) Covid-19"
659,Who is at highest risk for Pulseless electrical activity ?,Age i.e elderly Black race Female gender Heart failure patients Pulmonary disease Syncope
660,What to expect if I have Pulseless electrical activity  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The overall prognosis is poor for pulseless electrical activity unless any reversible causes exists. Also the more abnormal the Ecg findings on intial admission the more worse the prognosis.The time to intiate CPR also plays a pivotal role in prognosis. Persons who got CPR by a layperson or bystander and immediate defibrillation are noted to have better outcome after out-of-hospital udden cardiac arrest (SCA).
661,What are the symptoms of Radiation injury?,"Bleeding from the nose, mouth, gums, and rectum Bloody stool Bruising Confusion Dehydration Diarrhea Fainting Fatigue Fever Hair loss Inflammation of exposed areas (redness, tenderness, swelling, bleeding) Mouth ulcers Nausea and vomiting Open sores on the skin Skin burns (redness, blistering) Sloughing of skin Ulcers in the esophagus, stomach or intestines Vomiting blood Weakness Your doctor will advise you how best to treat these symptoms. Medications may be prescribed to help reduce nausea, vomiting, and pain. Blood transfusions may be given for anemia. Antibiotics are used to prevent or fight infections."
662,What causes Radiation injury?,"The causes include:
Accidental exposure to high doses of radiation such as a nuclear power plant accidents Exposure to excessive radiation for medical treatments"
663,What are the symptoms of Rheumatic fever?,"Fever Joint problems, which mainly affect in the knees, elbows, ankles, and wrists, appear joint swelling, joint pain. Pain in one joint that migrates to another joint. Skin nodules, skin rash (erythema marginatum) on the trunk and upper part of the arms or legs Epistaxis Cardiac problems, which may not have symptoms, or may result in shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and fatigue. Sydenham chorea: It is uncontrollable body movements, most often in the hands, feet and face; less often in the arms and legs. Emotion changes, such as crying or inappropriate laughing.
Diseases with similar symptoms:
Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Myocarditis Scarlet fever Congenital heart disease"
664,Who is at highest risk for Rheumatic fever ?,"Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and is responsible for many cases of damaged heart valves. It is not common in the United States, and usually occurs in isolated outbreaks. The latest outbreak was in the 1980s.
Rheumatic fever mainly affects children ages 5-15, and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat or scarlet fever."
665,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rheumatic fever ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of rheumatic fever. Because several other conditions have similar symptoms, you will need careful medical evaluation.
If you have symptoms of strep throat, tell your health care provider. You will need to be evaluated and treated if you do have strep throat, to decrease your risk of developing rheumatic fever."
666,What to expect if I have Rheumatic fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of rheumatic fever depends on:
Complications, especially whether heart valves are damaged. Whether the patient receives monthly antibiotics injection, especially during the first 3 -5 years after the first episode of the disease."
667,What are the symptoms of pulmonic stenosis?,"You may have no symptoms at all until late in the course of the disease. The diagnosis may have been made when your healthcare provider heard a heart murmur and then performed additional tests.
Breathlessness with activity. Chest pain, which resembles what is known as angina -type pain. The pain is crushing, squeezing, pressure or tightness in nature. The pain increases with exercise, relieved with rest. The patient feels pain under the chest bone, it may move to other areas. Fainting, weakness, or dizziness with activity. Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations)."
668,What causes aortic stenosis?,"In the United States, pulmonic stenosis often results from calcium deposits on the pulmonic valve. These deposits occur naturally with age and have no relationship with the amount of calcium in the diet. Worldwide, aortic stenosis occurs most commonly in those who've had rheumatic fever, a condition that may develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is increasingly rare in the United States. pulmonic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), or it may develop later in life (acquired). Children with pulmonic stenosis may have other congenital conditions. Radiation treatment to the chest, and some medications may cause pulmonic stenosis. pulmonic stenosis is not common. It occurs more often in men than in women. As the pulmonic valve becomes more narrow, the pressure increases inside the lower chamber of the heart (the right ventricle). This causes the right ventricle to become thicker, decreasing blood flow and can lead to chest pain."
669,Who is at highest risk for Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction ?,"pulmonic stenosis occurs more often in men than in women. The calcifications that cause most cases of pulmonic stenosis are more likely to occur in patients above the age of 50, who are overweight, who smoke, and who have diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These are the same risk factors for atherosclerosis of the coronary blood vessels."
670,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction ?,"Call your health care provider if you or your child have symptoms of pulmonic stenosis. For example, call if you or your child have increasing shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting. Also contact your doctor if you have been diagnosed with this condition and your symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop."
671,What to expect if I have Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with mild pulmonic stenosis may do very well using a watchful waiting approach with their health care provider. They may be treated medically for some conditions associated with pulmonic stenosis, such as high blood pressure, and may have a normal life expectancy.
Those with more severe symptoms, such as chest pain or signs of heart failure like shortness of breath and leg swelling, generally do poorly without surgery. However, surgery does have the potential to cure a person's pulmonic stenosis. The success of surgery depends on a number of factors, including patient age, overall activity level, and presence of other medical conditions. As with any operation, aortic valve surgery has some risks, most of which occur during the first 1-2 days after surgery.These include an irregular heart rhythm and blood clots in the legs. There is also a chance that the new or repaired valve may stop working which might require another surgery."
672,What are the symptoms of Second degree AV block?,"Second-degree heart block:
The electrical impulse may not reach the lower chambers of the heart. The heart may miss a beat or beats and may be slow and irregular. You may feel dizzy, faint, or have other symptoms. This may be serious in some cases."
673,What causes Second degree AV block?,"Heart block may be caused by:
Side effects of medicines. Heart block can be a side effect of digitalis, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other medicines. A heart attack that damages the electrical system in the heart. Heart diseases, such as heart valve disease and cardiac sarcoidosis. Some infections, such as Lyme disease. Heart surgery.
You may have heart block because you were born with it. You are more at risk for this if:
You have a heart defect. Your mother has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus."
674,Who is at highest risk for Second degree AV block ?,Common risk factors associated with second degree AV block include the following: Intrinsic atrioventricular node disease Myocarditis Acute myocardial infarction Prior cardiac surgery Older age Heart attack or coronary artery disease Cardiomyopathy Sarcoidosis Lyme disease High potassium levels Severe hypothyroidism Certain inherited neuromuscular diseases Medicines that slow the heart rate After open heart surgery
675,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Second degree AV block ?,"Call your provider if you feel:
Dizzy Weak Faint Racing heart beat Skipped heart beat Chest pain
Call your provider if you have signs of heart failure:
Weakness Swollen legs, ankles, or feet Feel short of breath"
676,What to expect if I have Second degree AV block  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With regular monitoring and treatment, you should be able to keep up with most of your usual activities."
677,What are the symptoms of Secondary amyloidosis?,"Symptoms depend on the organs affected by the deposits. Since the kidney is the most commonly affected organ, it will manifest with signs and symptoms related to kidney involvement.
Symptoms include:
Frothy urine Swelling in the arms and legs Periorbital edema
Other less common symptoms include:
Abdominal mass Enlarged tongue Fatigue Numbness of hands and feet Shortness of breath Skin changes Swallowing problems Weak hand grip Weight loss
Patients may also have other symptoms due to the underlying disorder, such as:
Fever Joint pain Abdominal pain Weakness Diarrhea"
678,What causes Secondary amyloidosis?,"Any condition causing chronic inflammation in the body may cause secondary amyloidosis as well. The most important causes of chronic inflammation include:
Chronic infections such as: Tuberculosis Leprosy Chronic infection of the bones (Osteomyelitis) Chronic infection of the kidney (Chronic pyelonephritis) Diseases that lead to chronic states of inflammation include: Poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis Juvenile arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis Psoriatic arthritis Crohn's disease
Secondary amyloidosis can lead to conditions that include:
Nephrotic syndrome Kidney failure Liver enlargement Neuropathy (nerves that do not work properly) Orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure with standing) Carpal tunnel syndrome Heart muscle damage (cardiomyopathy) leading to congestive heart failure Intestinal malabsorption
The deposits build up in the affected organs, causing them to become stiff, which decreases their ability to function."
679,Who is at highest risk for Secondary amyloidosis ?,Patients with diseases causing chronic infections and persistent inflammation within the body are at the highest risk of developing secondary amyloidosis.
680,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Secondary amyloidosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of kidney dysfunction, including periorbital edema, swelling of the ankles or others area, abdominal mass and etc. You know you have secondary amyloidosis and you have difficulty breathing, persistent swelling of the ankles or other areas, decreased urine output, or other symptoms that may indicate complications have developed."
681,What to expect if I have Secondary amyloidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Since kidney is the most commonly involved organ, it may lead to kidney failure and other complications including death."
682,What are the symptoms of shock?,"Symptoms of shock include:
Confusion or lack of alertness Loss of consciousness Sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat Sweating Pale skin A weak pulse Rapid breathing Decreased or no urine output Cool hands and feet"
683,What causes shock?,"There are several kinds of shock. Hypovolemic shock happens when you lose a lot of blood or fluids. Causes include internal or external bleeding, dehydration, burns, and severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. Septic shock is caused by infections in the bloodstream. A severe allergic reaction can cause anaphylactic shock. An insect bite or sting might cause it. Cardiogenic shock happens when the heart cannot pump blood effectively. This may happen after a heart attack. Neurogenic shock is caused by damage to the nervous system."
684,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Shock ?,Shock is a life-threatening medical emergency and it is important to get help right away.
685,What are the symptoms of sleep apnea?,"A person who has OSA is often not aware of the apnea episodes during the night. Usually, other family members notice the apnea episodes and alert the afflicted person.
A person with OSA will usually snore heavily soon after falling asleep. The snoring continues at a regular pace for a period of time, often becoming louder. It is then interrupted by a long silent period during which there is no breathing. This is followed by a loud snort and gasp, and the snoring returns. This pattern repeats frequently throughout the night.
The main symptoms of OSA are usually associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, including falling asleep at inappropriate times. Most people also report awakening unrefreshed in the morning.
Other symptoms may include:
Depression Memory difficulties Morning headaches Personality changes Poor concentration Restless and fitful sleep Frequent waking up during the night to urinate Insomnia
It is not uncommon for children with OSA to display hyperactive behavior. Leg swelling has also been linked to severe OSA."
686,What causes Sleep apnea?,"OSA is caused by the relaxation of the muscles of the back of the throat, which then impede airflow. Normally, the muscles of the upper part of the throat help keep the airway open and allow air to flow into the lungs. Even though these muscles usually relax during sleep, the upper throat should remain open wide enough to let air pass through unobstructed.
Several factors may affect the width of the throat area, and can therefore contribute to the obstruction of the airway. Having a narrower throat area can affect the ease with which air can pass through the airways. When the muscles in the narrower upper throat relax during sleep, the airway may completely close. This prevents air from getting into the lungs and loud snoring and labored breathing occur. During deep sleep, breathing can stop for a period of time (often more than 10 seconds). This is called apnea."
687,Who is at highest risk for Sleep apnea ?,"Gender: Sleep apnea affects adult men more often than women. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 40 percent of adult men and 24 percent of adult women are considered habitual snorers , and snoring is often associated with sleep apnea.
Metabolic Syndrome and Sleep Apnea:
Obesity: Obesity has been closely linked to OSA  in part because the extra fat around the neck can narrow the opening of the windpipe. Older obese men seem to be at higher risk since up to 40 percent of morbidly obese men in a clinical population are affected by OSA . Though it is hardly the only factor that has an effect, weight loss can alleviate some of the symptoms of OSA; losing 10 percent of body weight can reduce the number of apnea episodes throughout the night. 
Diabetes: Diabetes has also been associated with OSA independently from obesity. Studies have shown that both obese and slender people with diabetes have reported difficulty breathing while sleeping . The causal relationship, however, has not yet been established.
Hypertension: There is a definite link between hypertension and OSA. One out of every 2 people who have OSA are diagnosed with high blood pressure . The relationship between hypertension and OSA is also independent from other risk factors, including obesity.
Other risk factors: The following factors may also increase your risk for obstructive sleep apnea:
Certain shapes of the palate and jaw Large tonsils and adenoids in children Large neck or collar size Large tongue Narrow airway Nasal obstruction
In addition to these risk factors, drinking alcohol or using sedatives before sleep may exacerbate the condition and increase the likelihood of an episode of apnea.
Having a neck size over 17 inches for men and 16 inches for women is also a risk factor for sleep apnea. Moreover, having a deviated septum would cause a nasal obstruction that could lead to sleep apnea ."
688,What to expect if I have Sleep apnea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With the right treatment and follow-up care, the symptoms of sleep apnea should be totally corrected."
689,What are the symptoms of stroke?,"Symptoms of stroke depends on the location and the area the brain damage. Small strokes may not cause any symptoms. According to The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), there are five major signs of stroke as the following.
Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause
Other diseases with similar symptoms are:
Brain tumors Brain abscess Migraine headache Head trauma Meningitis Encephalitis Subarachnoid hemorrhage An overdose of certain medications An imbalance of electrolyte or glucose in the body, such as hyponatremia, hypoglycemia"
690,What causes Stroke?,"Stroke is the emergence condition of brain. There are two types of stroke: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke occurs when the arteries to your brain are narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow. While hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. About 80 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Clinical studies show that the common risk factors of stroke are hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking. According to The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), five major signs of stroke are five “sudden”: sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes， sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, sudden severe headache with no known cause. Nervous system physical examination and head images may help diagnose. Treatment of ischemic stroke includes anti-platelet drugs, anticoagulants, and carotid endarterectomy. For patients with hemorrhagic stroke, surgery may be recommended to treat these disorders or prevent another one. Rehabilitation is needed for patients to recover the functions lost. The prognosis of stroke depends on the location and area the brain damage, the time from onset to emergence department, the complications and the treatment effect of the rehabilitation. Measurements such as keep a healthy lifestyle, control hypertension and diabetes may decrease your risk of stroke."
691,Who is at highest risk for Stroke ?,"Hypertension Heart disease, such as coronary artery disease and rheumatic heart disease Diabetes High cholesterol Smoking Increasing age"
692,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stroke ?,A stroke is a medical emergency. Anyone suspected of having a stroke should be taken to a medical facility immediately for evaluation and treatment.
693,What to expect if I have Stroke  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of stroke depends on:
The location and the area of the brain damage: If a large area of hemorrhagic stroke is near brain axis, the patient has a high life-threatening risk. The time from onset to emergence department: The faster to sent the patient to the hospital after onset, the better outcome will get. Whether the patient is accompanied with the complications or not The treatment effect of the rehabilitation: This determines the life quality of the patient and his/her family in the furture."
694,What are the symptoms of Superior vena cava syndrome?,"Symptoms occur when something blocks the blood flowing back to the heart. They may begin suddenly or gradually, and may worsen when you bend over or lie down.
Early signs include:
Swelling around the eye Swelling of the face Swelling of the whites of the eyes
The swelling will most likely be worse in the early morning hours and go away by mid morning.
The most common symptoms are shortness of breath (dyspnea) and swelling of the face, neck, trunk, and arms.
Other possible symptoms include:
Decreased alertness Dizziness Fainting Headache Reddish face or cheeks Reddish palms Reddish mucus membranes (inside the nose, mouth, and other places) Redness changing to blueness later Sensation of head or ear ""fullness"" Vision changes"
695,What causes Superior vena cava syndrome?,"Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction is a relatively rare condition.
Most often it is caused by a cancer or a tumor in the mediastinum (the area of the chest under the breastbone and between the lungs).
The types of cancer that can lead to this condition include:
Breast cancer Lymphoma Metastatic lung cancer (lung cancer that spreads) Testicular cancer Thyroid cancer Thymic tumors
Superior vena cava obstruction can also be caused by noncancerous conditions that cause scarring. These conditions include:
Histoplasmosis infection Inflammation of a vein (thrombophlebitis) Lung infections (such as tuberculosis)
Other causes of superior vena cava obstruction include:
Aortic aneurysm Blood clots in the superior vena cava Constrictive pericarditis Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter) Catheters placed in the large veins of the upper arm and neck may cause blood clots in the superior vena cava."
696,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Superior vena cava syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of SVC obstruction. Complications are serious and can sometimes be fatal.
697,What to expect if I have Superior vena cava syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies depending on the cause and the amount of blockage. SVCS caused by a tumor is a sign that the tumor has spread, and it indicates a poorer long-term outlook."
698,What are the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia?,"Symptoms usually start and stop suddenly, and can last for a few minutes or several hours. They can include:
Anxiety Chest tightness Palpitations (a sensation of feeling the heart beat), often with an irregular or fast rate (racing) Rapid pulse Shortness of breath
Other symptoms that can occur with this condition:
Dizziness Fainting"
699,What causes supraventricular tachycardia?,"Normally, the chambers of the heart (atria and ventricles) contract in a coordinated manner.
The contractions are caused by an electrical signal that begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). The signal moves through the upper heart chambers (the atria) and tells the atria to contract. After this, the signal moves down in the heart and tells the lower chambers (the ventricles) to contract.
The rapid heart rate from PSVT may start with events that take place in many different areas above the lower heart chambers (ventricles).
PSVT can occur with digitalis toxicity and with conditions such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
The condition occurs most often in young people and infants.
The following increase your risk for PSVT:
Alcohol use Caffeine use Illicit drug use Smoking"
700,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Supraventricular tachycardia ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You often have a sensation of feeling the heart beat quickly and symptoms do not end on their own in a few minutes. You have a history of PSVT and an episode does not go away with the valsalva maneuver or by coughing, or other symptoms occur with the rapid heart rate. Symptoms return often New symptoms develop"
701,What to expect if I have Supraventricular tachycardia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"PSVT is generally not life threatening. If other heart disorders are present, it can lead to congestive heart failure or angina."
702,What are the symptoms of Syncope?,"Syncope itself is a symptom. Patients with syncope may feel:
Temporary loss of consciousness Blacking out Light-headedness Dizziness Grogginess, feeling unsteady or weak when standing, even falling
Similar symptoms may be seen in other diseases such as:
Dizziness Seizure Vertigo Coma Shock"
703,What causes Syncope?,"Cardiac causes
Arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia, sick sinus syndrome, long Q-T syndrome Abnormal cardiovascular structure, such as aortic stenosis, aortic dissection, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertension
Brain causes
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) Stroke
Vasovagal syncope: This is the most frequent and benign cause of syncope.
Cough syncope Defecation syncope Micturition syncope Swallow syncope Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
Orthostatic hypotension Hypoglycemia"
704,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Syncope ?,"Syncope is a sign of temporary loss of consciousness and many patients may recover after several minutes to hours. Once recovered, the patient should be sent to the hospital to confirm the causes."
705,What to expect if I have Syncope  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of syncope depends on:
Underlying causes: Syncope caused by cardiovascular diseases may be life-threatening. Prognosis of vasovagal syncope is relatively better. Whether the patient is associated with severe complications, such as falling, can lead to a cerebral hemorrhage."
706,What are the symptoms of Tetralogy of Fallot?,"Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms vary, depending on the extent of obstruction of blood flow out of the right ventricle and into the lungs. Signs and symptoms may include:
A bluish coloration of the skin caused by blood low in oxygen (cyanosis) Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding Loss of consciousness (fainting) Clubbing of fingers and toes — an abnormal, rounded shape of the nail bed Poor weight gain Tiring easily during play Irritability Prolonged crying A heart murmur Tet spells Sometimes, babies with tetralogy of Fallot will suddenly develop deep blue skin, nails and lips after crying, feeding, having a bowel movement, or kicking his or her legs upon awakening. These episodes are called ""Tet spells"" and are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. Toddlers or older children may instinctively squat when they are short of breath. Squatting increases blood flow to the lungs. Tet spells are more common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old."
707,What are the causes of Tetralogy of Fallot?,"Tetralogy of Fallot is classified as a cyanotic heart defect because the condition causes low oxygen levels in the blood. This leads to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin). The classic form of tetralogy includes four related defects of the heart and its major blood vessels:
Ventricular septal defect (hole between the right and left ventricles) Narrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract (the valve and artery that connect the heart with the lungs) Overriding aorta (the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body) that is shifted over the right ventricle and ventricular septal defect, instead of coming out only from the left ventricle A thickened muscular wall of the right ventricle (right ventricular hypertrophy) At birth, infants may not show signs of cyanosis. However, later they may develop sudden episodes (called ""Tet spells"") of bluish skin from crying or feeding.
Tetralogy of Fallot is rare, but it is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Patients with tetraology of Fallot have a higher incidence of major non-heart congenital defects. The cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown. Many factors seem to be involved. Factors that increase the risk for this condition during pregnancy include:
Alcoholism in the mother Diabetes Mother who is over 40 years old Poor nutrition during pregnancy Rubella or other viral illnesses during pregnancy There is a high incidence of chromosomal disorders in children with tetralogy of Fallot, such as Down syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome (a condition that causes heart defects, low calcium levels, and immune deficiency)."
708,Who is at highest risk for Tetralogy of Fallot ?,"While the exact cause of Tetralogy of Fallot is unknown, several factors may increase the risk of a baby being born with this condition. These include:
A viral illness in the mother, such as rubella (German measles), during pregnancy Maternal alcoholism Poor nutrition A mother older than 40 A parent with tetralogy of Fallot Babies who are also born with Down syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome"
709,How to know you have Tetralogy of Fallot?,If you or you're baby have any of the symptoms listed above. Contact your doctor if you are unsure.
710,What are the symptoms of Tetralogy of Fallot?,"Clubbing of fingers (skin or bone enlargement around the fingernails) Cyanosis, which becomes more pronounced when the baby is upset Difficult feeding (poor feeding habits) Failure to gain weight Passing out Poor development Squatting during episodes of cyanosis"

713,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tetralogy of fallot ?,"Call your health care provider if new unexplained symptoms develop or the patient is having an episode of cyanosis (blue skin).
If a child with tetralogy of Fallot becomes blue, immediately place the child on his or her side or back and put the knees up to the chest. Calm the baby and seek medical attention immediately."
714,What to expect if I have Tetralogy of fallot  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases can be corrected with surgery. Babies who have surgery usually do well. Ninety percent survive to adulthood and live active, healthy, and productive lives. Without surgery, death usually occurs by the time the person reaches age 20.
Patients who have continued, severe leakiness of the pulmonary valve may need to have the valve replaced.
Regular follow-up with a cardiologist to monitor for life-threatening arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) is recommended."
715,What are the symptoms of Tetralogy of Fallot?,"Patients with ventricular septal defects may not have symptoms. However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure.
The most common symptoms include:
Clubbing of fingers (skin or bone enlargement around the fingernails) Cyanosis, which becomes more pronounced when the baby is upset Difficult feeding (poor feeding habits) Failure to gain weight Passing out Poor development Squatting during episodes of cyanosis

720,What are the symptoms of Heart block?,"Symptoms depend on the type of heart block you have.
First-degree heart block rarely causes symptoms.
Symptoms of second- and third-degree heart block include:
Chest pain Dizziness Fainting Fatigue Heart failure symptoms Light-headedness Pre-syncope Shortness of breath Syncope"
721,What causes Heart block?,"Heart block has many causes. Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired).
One form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.
In pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.
Congenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.
Many factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:
Damage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Heart failure. Rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle diseases. Sarcoidosis Degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block. Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicines - including digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers - also may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems. Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes). An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.
In some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.
Also, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines."
722,Who is at highest risk for Third degree AV block ?,"Elderly, particularly those with ischemic heart disease, and patients with certain disorders such as Lyme disease are at increased risk of developing complete heart block (CHB)."
723,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Third degree AV block ?,"Any syncope, loss of consciousnesses in a patient with known risk factors of heart disease calls for urgent medical care."
724,What to expect if I have Third degree AV block  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of patients with complete heart block is generally poor without therapy. Patients with 1st and 2nd degree heart block are usually asymptomatic.
725,What are the symptoms of Third degree AV block?,"People with third-degree AV block typically experience severe bradycardia (an abnormally low measured heart rate), hypotension (decreased blood pressure), and at times, hemodynamic instability and syncope. They may faint, or complain of dizziness or simply feel week."
726,What causes Third degree AV block?,"Third-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) is a medical condition in which the nerve impulse generated in the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the atrium of the heart can not propagate to the ventricles.
Many conditions can cause third-degree heart block, but the most common cause is coronary ischemia. Progressive degeneration of the electrical conduction system of the heart can lead to third-degree heart block. This may be preceded by first-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, bundle branch block, or bifascicular block. In addition, acute myocardial infarction may present with third-degree AV block.
An inferior wall myocardial infarction may cause damage to the AV node, causing third-degree heart block. In this case, the damage is usually transitory. Studies have shown that third-degree heart block in the setting of an inferior wall myocardial infarction typically resolves within 2 weeks. The escape rhythm typically originates in the AV junction, producing a narrow complex escape rhythm.
An anterior wall myocardial infarction may damage the distal conduction system of the heart, causing third-degree heart block. This is typically extensive, permanent damage to the conduction system, necessitating a permanent pacemaker to be placed. The escape rhythm typically originates in the ventricles, producing a wide complex escape rhythm.
Third-degree heart block may also be congenital and has been linked to the presence of lupus in the mother. It is thought that maternal antibodies may cross the placenta and attack the heart tissue during gestation. The cause of congenital third-degree heart block in many patients is unknown. Studies suggest that the prevalence of congenital third-degree heart block is between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 22,000 live births.
Hyperkalemia in those with previous cardiac disease and Lyme disease can also result in third-degree heart block."
727,What are the symptoms of a Thoracic aortic aneurysm?,"Aneurysms develop slowly over many years. Most patients have no symptoms until the aneurysm begins to leak or expand. Chest or back pain may mean sudden widening or leakage of the aneurysm. Symptoms often begin suddenly when:
The aneurysm grows quickly The aneurysm tears open (called a rupture) Blood leaks along the wall of the aorta (aortic dissection)
If the aneurysm presses on nearby structures, the following symptoms may occur:
Hoarseness Swallowing problems High-pitched breathing (stridor) Swelling in the neck
Other symptoms may include:
Chest pain and / or back pain Clammy skin Nausea and vomiting Rapid heart rate Low blood pressure"
728,What causes Thoracic aortic aneurysm?,"The most common cause of a thoracic aortic aneurysm is hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). This condition is more common in people with high cholesterol, long-term high blood pressure, or who smoke. Other risk factors for a thoracic aneurysm include:
Connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome Inflammation of the aorta Syphilis Trauma such as falls or motor vehicle accidents"
729,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thoracic aortic aneurysm ?,"Tell your doctor if you have:
A family history of connective tissue disorders Chest pain or back discomfort"
730,What to expect if I have Thoracic aortic aneurysm  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The long-term prognosis for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm is determined by other medical problems such as heart disease and diabetes, which may have caused or contributed to the condition."
731,What are the symptoms of Thoracic outlet syndrome?,"Symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome may include:
Pain, numbness, and tingling in the last three fingers and inner forearm Pain and tingling in the neck and shoulders (carrying something heavy may make the pain worse) Signs of poor circulation in the hand or forearm Weakness of the muscles in the hand"
732,What causes Thoracic outlet syndrome?,"Thoracic outlet syndrome is a rare condition.
Blood vessels and nerves coming from the spine or major blood vessels of the body pass through a narrow space near the shoulder and armpit on their way to the arms. As they pass by or through the collarbone (clavicle) and upper ribs, they may not have enough space. Pressure (compression) on these blood vessels or nerves can cause symptoms in the arms or hands. Problems with the nerves account for almost all cases of thoracic outlet syndrome.
Compression can be caused by an extra cervical rib (above the first rib) or an abnormal tight fibrous band connecting the spinal vertebra to the rib. Patients often have a history of injury to the area or overuse of the shoulder."
733,Who is at highest risk for Thoracic outlet syndrome ?,People with long necks and droopy shoulders may be more likely to develop this condition because of extra pressure on their nerves and blood vessels.
734,What to expect if I have Thoracic outlet syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Having the fibrous band removed may eliminate symptoms if patients are selected carefully. Surgery can be successful in 50% to 80% of patients. Conservative approaches using physical therapy are helpful for many patients.
735,What are the symptoms of Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection?,"Symptoms vary widely. Sometimes no symptoms may be present in infancy or early childhood. Sometimes signs may display critically like the following:
Cyanosis Lethargy Frequent respiratory infections Poor feeding and growth Rapid breathing
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
736,Who is at highest risk for Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ?,The cause of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection is not clear. Some patients have other congenital heart disease.
737,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ?,Call your health care provider as soon as possible if your baby has symptoms of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.
738,What to expect if I have Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of total anomalous pulmonary venous depends on whether the surgery has been done with the patient. Without surgery, death may occur by age one in babies with more severe defects."
739,What are the symptoms of Transient ischemic attack?,"Symptoms begin suddenly, last only a short time (from a few minutes to 1 - 2 hours), then disappear completely. They may occur again at a later time. Symptoms usually occur on the same side of the body if more than one body part is involved.
A TIA is different from a stroke. However, the symptoms of TIA are the same as the symptoms of a stroke and include the sudden development of:
Muscle weakness of the face, arm, or leg (usually only on one side of the body) Numbness or tingling on one side of the body Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking Problems with eyesight (double vision, loss of all or part of vision) Changes in sensation, involving touch, pain, temperature, pressure, hearing, and taste Change in alertness (sleepiness, less responsive, unconscious, or coma) Personality, mood, or emotional changes Confusion or loss of memory Difficulty swallowing Difficulty writing or reading Lack of coordination and balance, clumsiness, or trouble walking Abnormal sensation of movement (vertigo) or dizziness Lack of control over the bladder or bowels Inability to recognize or identify sensory stimuli (agnosia)"
740,What causes Transient ischemic attack?,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is caused by temporary disturbance of blood supply to an area of the brain. This results in a sudden, brief decrease in brain function. (A decrease in brain function is called a neurologic deficit.)
A TIA is different from a stroke. Unlike a stroke, a TIA does not cause brain tissue to die. The symptoms of TIAs do not last as long the symptoms of a stroke. TIAs also do not show changes to the brain on CT or MRI scans. (Strokes usually show changes on such tests.)
The temporary loss of blood flow to the brain can be caused by:
A blood clot within an artery of the brain A blood clot that travels to the brain from somewhere else in the body (for example, the heart) An injury to blood vessels Narrowing of a blood vessel in the brain or leading to the brain
For instance, the temporary disruption in blood flow could be due to a blood clot that occurs and then dissolves. The blockage breaks up quickly and dissolves.
Less common causes of TIA include:
An irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation Certain blood disorders, including polycythemia, sickle cell anemia, and syndromes where the blood is very thick Conditions that cause blood vessels problems such as fibromuscular dysplasia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and syphilis Inflammation of the arteries such as arteritis, polyarteritis, and granulomatous angiitis Spasm of the small arteries in the brain
Atherosclerosis (""hardening of the arteries"") is a condition where fatty deposits occur on the inner lining of the arteries. This condition dramatically increases the risk for both TIAs and stroke. About 80 - 90% of people who have a stroke due to atherosclerosis had a TIA episode before."
741,Who is at highest risk for Transient ischemic attack ?,"Risks for TIA include:
High blood pressure Heart disease Migraine headaches Smoking Diabetes Increasing age."
742,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Transient ischemic attack ?,A TIA is a medical emergency. Call 911 or another local emergency number immediately. Do not ignore symptoms just because they go away. They may be a warning of a future stroke.
743,What to expect if I have Transient ischemic attack  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"TIAs do not cause lasting damage to the brain.
However, they are a warning sign that you may have a true stroke some day. Over 10% of people who have a TIA will have a stroke within 3 months. Half of these strokes happen during the 48 hours after a TIA. The stroke may occur that same day or at a later time. Some people have only a single episode, and some have recurrent episodes.
Your chances of a future stroke can be reduced by close follow-up with your health care provider to manage risk factors."
744,What are the symptoms of Transposition of the great vessels?,Blueness of the skin Clubbing of the fingers or toes Poor feeding Shortness of breath
745,What causes Transposition of the great vessels?,"The cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown.
Transposition of the great vessels is a cyanotic heart defect. This means there is decreased oxygen in the blood that is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body. Low blood oxygen leads to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin) and shortness of breath. In normal hearts, blood that returns from the body goes through the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen. The blood then comes back to the left side of the heart and travels out the aorta to the body. In transposition of the great vessels, the blood goes to the lungs, picks up oxygen, and then goes right back to the lungs without ever going to the body. Blood from the body returns to the heart and goes back to the body without ever picking up oxygen in the lungs. Symptoms appear at birth or very soon afterward. How bad the symptoms are depends on the type and size of heart defects (such as atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus) and how much oxygen moves through the body's general blood flow.
The condition is the second most common cyanotic heart defect."
746,Who is at highest risk for Transposition of the great vessels ?,"Factors in the mother that may increase the risk of this condition include:
Age over 40 Alcoholism Diabetes Poor nutrition during pregnancy (prenatal nutrition) Rubella or other viral illness during pregnancy"
747,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Transposition of the great vessels ?,"Most often, this condition is diagnosed during routine examination. This condition can also be diagnosed before birth using a fetal echocardiogram. If not, it is usually diagnosed soon after a baby is born. Call your infant's health care provider if the baby seems to be having difficulty breathing, if your baby's skin develops a bluish color, especially in the face or trunk. or if the baby seems to have an unusual number of respiratory infections.
Contact your health care provider if your baby has this condition and new symptoms develop, get worse, or continue after treatment."
748,What to expect if I have Transposition of the great vessels  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The child's symptoms will improve after surgery to correct the defect. Most infants who undergo arterial switch do not have symptoms after surgery and live normal lives. If corrective surgery is not performed, the life expectancy is months."
749,What are the symptoms of Tricuspid atresia?,"Patients with ventricular septal defects may not have symptoms. However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure.
The most common symptoms include:
Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin) Easily fatigued Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Fast breathing (tachypnea) Poor growth"
750,What causes Tricuspid atresia?,"Tricuspid atresia is an uncommon form of congenital heart disease that affects about 5 in every 100,000 live births. 20% of patients with this condition will also have have other heart problems.
Normally, blood flows from the body into the right atrium, then through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and on to the lungs. If the tricuspid valve does not open, the blood cannot flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Blood ultimately cannot enter the lungs, where it must go to pick up oxygen (become oxygenated).
Infants with tricuspid atresia generally are cyanotic (bluish discoloration of skin) and easily become short of breath."
751,Who is at highest risk for Tricuspid atresia ?,"As with all congenital heart diseases, families with a history of tricuspid atresia run a higher risk of passing it onto their children. Other potential factors include access to prenatal care and the mother's behavior during pregnancy (i.e. alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, etc)."
752,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tricuspid atresia ?,"If your infant has new changes in breathing patterns, eats less (decreased feeding), or has skin or mucous membranes that are turning blue (cyanotic), contact your health care provider immediately."
753,What to expect if I have Tricuspid atresia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Improvement can be expected with most surgical procedures. Unexpected death may occur with heart arrhythmias.
754,What are the symptoms of Tricuspid prolapse?,"The symptoms of tricuspid prolapse include:
Weakness Fatigue Irregular heart beats (atrial fibrillation) Strong pulse in your neck Swelling of the liver Abdominal pain Swelling in your legs"
755,What causes Tricuspid prolapse?,"The tricuspid valve separates the right lower heart chamber (the right ventricle) from the right upper heart chamber (right atrium).
The most common cause of tricuspid prolapse is swelling of the right ventricle. Such swelling may be a complication of any disorder that causes failure of the right ventricle, such as rheumatic fever, lung diseases such as emphysema.
Tricuspid prolapse may be found in those with infections, birth defects that cause the valves to be floppy and not function correctly.
Degenerative process in the valve can also cause the valve to slip out of place and not function properly."
756,How to know you have a Tricuspid prolapse?,"The doctor will perform a physical exam and use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs. The doctor may hear a heart murmur (""midsystolic murmur""). The physical exam may reveal swelling of the liver.
Tests that are done include:
ECG, Chest X-ray, Echocardiogram may show swelling of the right side of the heart, Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), CT scan of the chest"
757,What are the symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation?,"Tricuspid regurgitation may not cause any symptoms if the patient does not have pulmonary hypertension. If pulmonary hypertension and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation exist together, the following symptoms may result:
Active pulsing in the neck veins Decreased urine output Fatigue, tiredness General swelling Swelling of the abdomen Swelling of the feet and ankles Weakness"
758,What causes tricuspid regurgitation?,"The tricuspid valve separates the right lower heart chamber (the right ventricle) from the right upper heart chamber (right atrium). The most common cause of tricuspid regurgitation is swelling of the right ventricle. Such swelling may be a complication of any disorder that causes failure of the right ventricle. Tricuspid regurgitation may also be caused by or made worse by valve disease on the left side of the heart such as mitral regugitation and mitral stenosis. Other diseases can directly affect the tricuspid valve. The most common of these is rheumatic fever, which is a complication of untreated strep throat infections. Tricuspid regurgitation may be found in those with a type of congenital heart disease called Ebstein's anomaly.
Other infrequent causes of tricuspid regurgitation include:
Carcinoid tumors, which release a hormone that damages the valve Marfan syndrome Injury Rheumatoid arthritis Radiation therapy
Another important risk factor for tricuspid regurgitation is use of the diet medications called ""Fen-Phen"" (phentermine and fenfluramine) or dexfenfluramine."
759,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tricuspid regurgitation ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation are present.
760,What to expect if I have Tricuspid regurgitation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treatment of any underlying conditions, especially high blood pressure in the lungs and swelling of the right lower heart chamber, may correct the disorder. Surgical valve repair or replacement usually provides a cure. However, persons with severe tricuspid regurgitation that cannot be corrected may have a poor prognosis."
761,What are the symptoms of Tricuspid stenosis?,"Symptoms include:
Fatigue Swelling over different parts of the body Abdominal discomfort due to swelling. Patients may complain about prominent pulsations in the neck."
762,What causes Tricuspid stenosis?,"It is commonly caused by rheumatic fever and can be accompanied by mitral stenosis. Other causes include carcinoid syndrome, endocarditis, endomyocardial fibrosis, lupus erythematosus, right atrial myxoma and congenital tricuspid atresia."
763,Who is at highest risk for Tricuspid stenosis ?,Rheumatic fever is one the risks factor.
764,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tricuspid stenosis ?,"Patient who have symptoms like fatigue, swelling over body, breathlessness, racing of heart etc then a medical professional should be contacted."
765,What are the symptoms of Unstable angina / Non ST-elevation myocardial infarction?,"Symptoms include:
Sudden chest pain that may also be felt in the shoulder, arm, jaw, neck, back, or other area Pain that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching Pain that occurs at rest and does not easily go away when using medicine Shortness of breath
If you have stable angina, you may be developing unstable angina if the chest pain:
Starts to feel different Lasts longer than 15 - 20 minutes Occurs at different times"
766,What causes Unstable angina / Non ST elevation myocardial infarction?,"Coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis is by far the most common cause of unstable angina. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fatty material called plaque along the walls of the arteries. This causes arteries to become less flexible and narrow, which interrupts blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain.
At first, angina may be considered stable. The chest pain only occurs with activity or stress. The pain does not become more frequent or severe over time.
Unstable angina is chest pain that is sudden and gets increasingly worse. The chest pain:
Occurs without cause (for example, it wakes you up from sleep) Lasts longer than 15 - 20 minutes Responds poorly to a medicine called nitroglycerin May occur along with a drop in blood pressure or significant shortness of breath People with unstable angina are at increased risk of having a heart attack.
Coronary artery spasm is a rare cause of angina."
767,Who is at highest risk for  non ST elevation myocardial infarction ?,"Risk factors for coronary artery disease include:
Diabetes Family history of coronary heart disease before age 50 High blood pressure High LDL cholesterol Low HDL cholesterol Male gender Not getting enough exercise Obesity Older age Smoking"
768,When to seek urgent medical care when I have  non ST elevation myocardial infarction ?,"Seek medical attention if you have new, unexplained chest pain or pressure. If you have had angina before, call your doctor.
Call 911 if your angina pain:
Does not go away after 15 minutes Does not go away after three doses of nitroglycerin Is getting worse Returns after the nitroglycerin helped at first
Call your doctor if:
You are having angina symptoms more often. You are having angina when you are sitting. This is called'rest angina'. You are feeling tired more often. You are feeling faint or light-headed, or you pass out. Your heart is beating very slowly (less than 60 beats a minute) or very fast (more than 120 beats a minute), or it is not steady. You are having trouble taking your heart medicines. You have any other unusual symptoms. If you think you are having a heart attack, seek immediate medical treatment."
769,What to expect if I have  non ST elevation myocardial infarction  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well you do depends on many different things, including:
The severity of coronary artery disease The severity of the most current unstable angina attack Whether you've ever had a heart attack The medicines you were taking when the angina attack started How well your heart muscle is pumping Arrhythmias and heart attacks can cause sudden death."
770,What are the symptoms of (Valvular heart disease)?,"Symptoms depend on the patient and the type and severity of valve disease. Some patients have no symptoms at all. In other cases, valve disease may take its toll over many years. In time, patients may develop congestive heart failure. Also, valve disease may lead to heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), and blood clots."
771,What causes (Valvular heart disease)?,"Before doctors started giving their patients antibiotics, rheumatic fever was the single biggest cause of valve disease. Today, the cause of valve disease is most likely linked to one of the following:
A weakening of the valve tissue caused by energy changes in the body. This is called myxomatous degeneration. It happens most often in elderly patients and commonly affects the mitral valve.
A buildup of calcium on the aortic or mitral valves, which causes the valves to thicken. This is called calcific degeneration.
An irregularly shaped aortic valve or a narrowed mitral valve. This is usually a congenital defect, which means that most people who have it were born with it.
Use of the anti-obesity medicines fen-phen and Redux, which were removed from the market after being linked to heart valve disease.
An infection in the lining of the heart's walls and valves (the endocardium). This is called infective endocarditis.
Coronary artery disease.
Heart attack."
772,What are the symptoms of vascular ring?,"Some children with vascular ring never develop symptoms. However, other cases may show breathing and digestive problems caused by the pressure on the windpipe and esophagus.
High-pitched cough Wheezing Respiratory infections Dysphagia Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Slow breast or bottle feeding Vomiting"
773,What causes vascular ring?,"Vascular ring is rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart problems. The condition occurs as often in males as females. Some infants with vascular ring also have another congenital heart problem. Vascular ring occurs very early in the baby's development in the womb. Normally, the aorta develops from one of several curved pieces of tissue (arches). The body breaks down some of the remaining arches, while others form into arteries. Some arteries that should break down do not; this forms vascular rings.
With vascular ring, some of the arches and vessels that should have changed into arteries or disappeared are still present when the baby is born. These arches form a ring of blood vessels, which encircles and presses down on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus.
Several different types of vascular ring exist. In some types, the vascular ring only partially encircles the trachea and esophagus, but it still can cause symptoms."
774,Who is at highest risk for Vascular ring ?,"Although the cause of vascular ring is not clear, studies have demonstrated that it is associated with chromosome deletion."
775,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vascular ring ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has symptoms of vascular ring. Getting diagnosed and treated quickly can prevent serious complications such as damage to the trachea and even death. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Persisting wheezing Dyspnea"
776,What to expect if I have Vascular ring  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of vascular ring depends on:
The pressure of the vascular ring putting on the esophagus and trachea. How quickly the infant is diagnosed and treated when symptoms appear. Whether the surgery has been performed or not."
777,What are the symptoms of Ventricular fibrillation?,"A person who has a VF episode can suddenly collapse or become unconscious, because the brain and muscles have stopped receiving blood from the heart.
The following symptoms may occur within minutes to 1 hour before the collapse:
Chest pain Dizziness Nausea Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath"
778,What causes Ventricular fibrillation?,"Fibrillation is an uncontrolled twitching or quivering of muscle fibers (fibrils). When it occurs in the lower chambers of the heart, it is called ventricular fibrillation. During ventricular fibrillation, blood is not pumped from the heart. Sudden cardiac death results. The most common cause of VF is a heart attack. However, VF can occur whenever the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen."
779,Who is at highest risk for Ventricular fibrillation ?,"Conditions that can lead to VF include:
Electrocution accidents or injury to the heart Heart attack Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital heart disease) Heart muscle disease, including cardiomyopathies Heart surgery Narrowed coronary arteries Sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis), typically occurring in athletes after an injury over the surface of the heart.
Most people with VF have no history of heart disease. Yet they often have risk factors for heart disease, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes."
780,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ventricular fibrillation ?,Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency and must be treated immediately to save a person's life.
781,What to expect if I have Ventricular fibrillation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"VF will lead to death within a few minutes unless it is treated quickly and effectively. Even then, long-term survival for people who live through a VF attack outside of the hospital is between 2% and 25%.
People who have survived VF may be in a coma or have long-term damage."
782,What are the symptoms of Ventricular septal defect?,"Patients with ventricular septal defects may not have symptoms. However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure.
The most common symptoms include:
Shortness of breath Fast breathing Hard breathing Paleness Failure to gain weight Fast heart rate Sweating while feeding Frequent respiratory infections"
783,What causes Ventricular septal defect?,"Before a baby is born, the right and left ventricles of its heart are not separate. As the fetus grows, a wall forms to separate these two ventricles. If the wall does not completely form, a hole remains. This hole is known as a ventricular septal defect, or a VSD.
Ventricular septal defect is one of the most common congenital heart defects. The baby may have no symptoms, and the hole can eventually close as the wall continues to grow after birth. If the hole is large, too much blood will be pumped to the lungs, leading to heart failure. The cause of VSD is not yet known. This defect often occurs along with other congenital heart defects.
In adults, ventricular septal defects are a rare but serious complication of heart attacks. These holes are related to heart attacks and do not result from a birth defect."
784,Who is at highest risk for Ventricular septal defect ?,"Like most congenital heart defects, it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with atrial septal defects. There is evidence to suggest that families with a history of genetic problems and other congenital heart disease may be at an increased risk for carrying and expressing the trait. Genetic testing may be performed to assist you in estimating the likelihood that any future children may be born with an atrial septal defect.
During pregnancy, drug and alcohol exposure can also harm the fetus during development and result in potential birth defects."
785,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ventricular septal defect ?,"Most often, this condition is diagnosed during routine examination of an infant. Call your infant's health care provider if the baby seems to be having difficulty breathing, or if the baby seems to have an unusual number of respiratory infections. {{#ev:youtube|aOKMka18Xto}}"
786,What to expect if I have Ventricular septal defect  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many small defects will close on their own. For those defects that do not spontaneously close, the outcome is good with surgical repair. Complications may result if a large defect is not treated.
{{#ev:youtube|AFU8Y8a4hJY}}"
787,What are the symptoms of Ventricular tachycardia?,"If the heart rate during a ventricular tachycardia episode is very fast or lasts longer than a few seconds there may be symptoms such as:
Chest discomfort (angina) Fainting (syncope) Light-headedness or dizziness Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) Shortness of breath
Note: Symptoms may start and stop suddenly. In some cases, there are no symptoms."
788,What causes Ventricular tachycardia?,"Ventricular tachycardia is a pulse rate of more than 100 beats per minute, with at least three irregular heartbeats in a row.
The condition can develop as an early or late complication of a heart attack. It may also occur in patients with:
Cardiomyopathy Heart failure Heart surgery Low magnesium levels Low potassium levels Myocarditis Valvular heart disease
Ventricular tachycardia can occur without heart disease.
Scar tissue may form in the muscle of the ventricles days, months, or years after a heart attack. This can lead to ventricular tachycardia.
Ventricular tachycardia can also be caused by:
Anti-arrhythmic medications Changes in blood chemistry (such as a low potassium level) Changes in pH (acid-base) Lack of enough oxygen
Torsade de pointes is a form of ventricular tachycardia that is often due to congenital heart disease or the use of certain medications such as clarithromycin, erythromycin and claritin."
789,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ventricular tachycardia ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a rapid, irregular pulse, faint, or have chest pain. All of these may be signs of ventricular tachycardia."
790,What to expect if I have Ventricular tachycardia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on the heart condition and symptoms.
791,What are the symptoms of Vertebrobasilar insufficiency?,Difficulty keeping your balance Difficulty swallowing Difficulty walking Double vision or vision loss Headache Hearing loss Nausea and vomiting Neck ache Numbness or tingling Poor coordination Sleepiness or even apparent sleep from which the person can not be awakened Slurred speech Stroke or transient ischemic attack Vertigo (sensation of things spinning around)
792,What causes Vertebrobasilar insufficiency?,"The vertebrobasilar system is also called the back (posterior) circulation of the brain. Three main blood vessels provide blood flow to the back of the brain:
One basilar artery Two vertebral arteries
The back of the brain contains structures that are crucial for keeping a person alive. For instance, the brainstem controls breathing and swallowing, among other things. Parts of the brain help with vision (occipital lobes) and movement coordination (cerebellus) are also located in the back of the brain.
Many different conditions may cause blood flow in the back part of the brain to be reduced or stopped. The most common cause is a stroke due to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).
Vertebrobasilar vascular disorders may also be caused if a tear (dissection) in an artery wall leads to the release of a clot that blocks blood flow. Dissection can be caused by clogged arteries, conditions such as fibromuscular dysplasia, or injuries such a car accident. It may even be caused by manipulations of the neck by a chiropractor, or during massage. However, most of the time, no apparent cause of dissection can be identified. When vertebrobasilar disease is present in a younger person, dissection of one of the arteries is often the cause.
Other less common causes of vertebrobasilar vascular disorders include connective tissue diseases and vasculitis."
793,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vertebrobasilar insufficiency ?,"Call 911 or your local emergency number, or get to the emergency room if you have any symptoms that may suggest a vertebrobasilar insufficiency."
794,What to expect if I have Vertebrobasilar insufficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends in part on the underlying cause. Strokes are potentially life-threatening, and require urgent medical care. Age and the person's overall health are taken into consideration when determining one's outlook for recovery. A substantial recovery can be expected in younger patients who have no significant medical problems.
Recovery also depends on the area of the brain that has been affected. The outlook is very poor when the patient is in a coma or cannot move both arms and legs."
795,Who should not take Vytorin?,"Do not take Vytorin:
If you are allergic to ezetimibe or simvastatin, the active ingredients in Vytorin, or to the inactive ingredients. For a list of inactive ingredients, see the “ Inactive ingredients” section at the end of this information sheet. If you have active liver disease or repeated blood tests indicating possible liver problems. If you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant, or planning to become pregnant or breast-feeding.
Vytorin is not recommended for use in children under 10 years of age."
796,What should I tell my doctor before and while taking Vytorin?,"Tell your doctor right away if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. This is because on rare occasions, muscle problems can be serious, including muscle breakdown resulting in kidney damage.
The risk of muscle breakdown is greater at higher doses of Vytorin.
The risk of muscle breakdown is greater in patients with kidney problems.
Taking Vytorin with certain substances can increase the risk of muscle problems. It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following:
cyclosporine danazol antifungal agents (such as itraconazole or ketoconazole) fibric acid derivatives (such as gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, or fenofibrate) the antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, and telithromycin HIV protease inhibitors (such as indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) the antidepressant nefazodone amiodarone (a drug used to treat an irregular heartbeat) verapamil (a drug used to treat high blood pressure, chest pain associated with heart disease, or other heart conditions) large doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin or nicotinic acid large quantities of grapefruit juice (>1 quart daily)
It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking coumarin anticoagulants (drugs that prevent blood clots, such as warfarin).
Tell your doctor about any prescription and nonprescription medicines you are taking or plan to take, including natural or herbal remedies.
Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions including allergies.
Tell your doctor if you:
drink substantial quantities of alcohol or ever had liver problems. Vytorin may not be right for you. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Do not use Vytorin if you are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking Vytorin, stop taking it and contact your doctor immediately. are breast-feeding. Do not use Vytorin if you are breast-feeding.
Tell other doctors prescribing a new medication that you are taking Vytorin."
797,How should I take Vytorin?,"Your doctor has prescribed your dose of Vytorin. The available doses of Vytorin are 10/10, 10/20, 10/40, and 10/80. The usual daily starting dose is Vytorin 10/20.
Take Vytorin once a day, in the evening, with or without food. Try to take Vytorin as prescribed. If you miss a dose, do not take an extra dose. Just resume your usual schedule. Continue to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet while taking Vytorin. Ask your doctor if you need diet information. Keep taking Vytorin unless your doctor tells you to stop. If you stop taking Vytorin, your cholesterol may rise again."
798,What should I do in case of an overdose?,Contact your doctor immediately.
799,What are the possible side effects of Vytorin?,"See your doctor regularly to check your cholesterol level and to check for side effects. Your doctor may do blood tests to check your liver before you start taking Vytorin and during treatment.
In clinical studies patients reported the following common side effects while taking Vytorin: headache and muscle pain (see What should I tell my doctor before and while taking Vytorin?).
The following side effects have been reported in general use with either ezetimibe or simvastatin tablets (tablets that contain the active ingredients of Vytorin):
allergic reactions including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing (which may require treatment right away), rash, hives; joint pain; muscle pain; alterations in some laboratory blood tests; liver problems (sometimes serious); inflammation of the pancreas; nausea; dizziness; tingling sensation; depression; gallstones; inflammation of the gallbladder.
Tell your doctor if you are having these or any other medical problems while on Vytorin. This is not a complete list of side effects. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist."
800,What should I know about high cholesterol?,"Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood. Cholesterol comes from two sources. It is produced by your body and it comes from the food you eat. Your total cholesterol is made up of both LDL and HDL cholesterol.
LDL cholesterol is called “bad” cholesterol because it can build up in the wall of your arteries and form plaque. Over time, plaque build-up can cause a narrowing of the arteries. This narrowing can slow or block blood flow to your heart, brain, and other organs. High LDL cholesterol is a major cause of heart disease and stroke.
HDL cholesterol is called “good” cholesterol because it keeps the bad cholesterol from building up in the arteries.
Triglycerides also are fats found in your body."
801,What are the symptoms of Wide complex tachycardia ?,"If the heart rate during a ventricular tachycardia episode is very fast or lasts longer than a few seconds. There may be symptoms such as:
Chest discomfort (angina) Fainting (syncope) Light-headedness or dizziness Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) Shortness of breath
Note: Symptoms may start and stop suddenly. In some cases, there are no symptoms."
802,What are the causes of Wide complex tachycardia ?,"Ventricular tachycardia is a pulse rate of more than 100 beats per minute, with at least three irregular heartbeats in a row.
The condition can develop as an early or late complication of a heart attack. It may also occur in patients with:
Cardiomyopathy Heart failure Heart surgery Myocarditis Valvular heart disease
Ventricular tachycardia can occur without heart disease.
Scar tissue may form in the muscle of the ventricles days, months, or years after a heart attack. This can lead to ventricular tachycardia.
Ventricular tachycardia can also be caused by:
Anti-arrhythmic medications Changes in blood chemistry (such as a low potassium level) Changes in pH (acid-base) Lack of enough oxygen
"" Torsade de pointes "" is a form of ventricular tachycardia that is often due to congenital heart disease or the use of certain medications."
803,What to expect Outlook (Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on the heart condition and symptoms.
804,What are the symptoms of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"How often the rapid heart rate occurs depends on the patient. Some people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome may have just a few episodes of rapid heart rate. Others may have the rapid heart rate once or twice a week. Sometimes there are no symptoms, and the condition is detected when a heart tests are done for another reason.
A person with WPW syndrome may have:
Chest pain or chest tightness Dizziness Light-headedness Fainting Sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations) Shortness of breath
In rare cases, arrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death. The most common arrhythmia associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia."
805,What causes Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"Normally, electrical signals in the heart go through a pathway that helps the heart beat regularly. The wiring of the heart prevents extra beats from occurring and keeps the next beat from happening too soon. In people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, there is an extra, or accessory, pathway that may cause a very rapid heart rate. This is called supraventricular tachycardia."
806,Who is at highest risk for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome ?,Mutations in the PRKAG2 gene cause Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Most cases of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome occur in people with no apparent family history of the condition. These cases are described as sporadic and are not inherited. Familial Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome accounts for only a small percentage of all cases of this condition.
807,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of Wolff-Parkinson-White develop, or if you have this disorder and symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment."
808,What to expect if I have Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Catheter ablation cures this disorder in most patients. The success rate for the procedure ranges between 85 - 95%. Success rate will vary depending on location of accessory pathway and number of accessory pathways.
809,Why this medication is prescribed?,"Doxazosin (Cardura, Cardura XL) is used in men to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), which include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency. Doxazosin (Cardura) is also used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Doxazosin is in a class of medications called alpha-blockers. It relieves the symptoms of BPH by relaxing the muscles of the bladder and prostate. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body."
810,How this medication should be used?,"Doxazosin comes as a tablet and an extended-release tablet to take by mouth. The doxazosin tablet is usually taken with or without food once a day in the morning or in the evening. The doxazosin extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day with breakfast. To help you remember to take doxazosin, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take doxazosin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Your doctor will start you on a low dose of doxazosin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 1 to 2 weeks. If you stop taking doxazosin for a few days or longer, call your doctor. Your doctor will have to start you again on the lowest dose of doxazosin and gradually increase your dose.
Doxazosin controls high blood pressure and the symptoms of BPH but does not cure them. It may take a few weeks before you feel the full benefit of doxazosin. Continue to take doxazosin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking doxazosin without talking to your doctor."
811,What to do if you forget a dose?,"Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Check with your doctor if you have missed two or more doses."
812,Why this medication is prescribed?,"Pravastatin is used together with lifestyle changes (diet, weight-loss, exercise) to reduce the amount of cholesterol (a fat-like substance) and other fatty substances in the blood. Pravastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body.
Buildup of cholesterol and other fats along the walls of the blood vessels (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Lowering blood levels of cholesterol and other fats may help to decrease your chances of getting heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. In addition to taking a cholesterol-lowering medication, making certain changes in your daily habits can also lower your cholesterol blood levels. You should eat a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol (see SPECIAL DIETARY), exercise 30 minutes on most, if not all days, and lose weight if you are overweight."
813,How this medication should be used?,"Pravastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take pravastatin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pravastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of pravastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 weeks.
Continue to take pravastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pravastatin without talking to your doctor."
814,What to do if you forget a dose?,"Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue the regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one."
815,What is the most important information I should know about rivaroxaban?,"People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. rivaroxaban lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking rivaroxaban, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.
Do not stop taking rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping rivaroxaban increases your risk of having a stroke.
If you have to stop taking rivaroxaban, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.
Rivaroxaban can cause bleeding which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because rivaroxaban is a blood thinner medicine that reduces blood clotting. While you take rivaroxaban you are likely to bruise more easily and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.
You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take rivaroxaban and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:
Aspirin or aspirin containing products Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Warfarin sodium (Coumadin®, Jantoven®) Any medicine that contains heparin Clopidogrel (Plavix®) Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots
Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.
Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:
Nose bleeds that happen often Unusual bleeding from the gums Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal or vaginal bleeding
Bleeding that is severe or you cannot control Red, pink or brown urine Bright red or black stools (looks like tar) Cough up blood or blood clots Vomit blood or your vomit looks like ""coffee grounds"" Headaches, feeling dizzy or weak Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites
People who take a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) like rivaroxaban, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:
A thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine. You take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting You have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures You have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine.
If you take rivaroxaban and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence)."
816,What is rivaroxaban?,"Rivaroxaban is a prescription medicine used to:
Reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people who have a medical condition called atrial fibrillation. With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. Treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism) and reduce the risk of them occurring again. Reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had hip or knee replacement surgery.
It is not known if rivaroxaban is safe and effective in children."
817,Who should not take rivaroxaban?,"Do not take rivaroxaban if you:
Currently have certain types of abnormal bleeding. Talk to your doctor before taking rivaroxaban if you currently have unusual bleeding. Are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the ingredients in rivaroxaban. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in rivaroxaban."
818,What should I tell my doctor before taking rivaroxaban?,"Before you take rivaroxaban, tell your doctor if you:
Have ever had bleeding problems Have liver or kidney problems Have any other medical condition Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if rivaroxaban will harm your unborn baby.

835,What are the symptoms of Acne?,"Acne commonly appears on the face and shoulders, but it may also occur on the trunk, arms, legs, and buttocks.
Blackheads Crusting of skin bumps Cysts Papules (small red bumps) Pustules Redness around the skin eruptions Scarring of the skin Whiteheads"
836,What causes Acne?,"Acne occurs when tiny holes on the surface of the skin, called pores, become clogged.
Each pore is an opening to a follicle, which contains a hair and an oil gland. These oil glands help lubricate the skin and help remove old skin cells. When glands produce too much oil, the pores can become blocked. Dirt, debris, bacteria, and inflammatory cells build up. The blockage is called a plug or comedone. The top of the plug may be white (whitehead) or dark (blackhead). If the plug breaks open, the material inside causes swelling and red bumps to form. If the inflammation is deep in your skin, the pimples may enlarge to form firm, painful cysts.
Acne is a problem of swelling and inflammation, not a problem caused by bacteria.
Acne tends to run in families and can be triggered by:
Hormonal changes related to menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills, or stress Greasy or oily cosmetic and hair products Certain drugs (such as steroids, testosterone, estrogen, and phenytoin) High levels of humidity and sweating
Despite the popular belief that chocolate, nuts, and greasy foods cause acne, research does not confirm this idea. Diets high in refined sugars may be related to acne, though."
837,Who is at highest risk for Acne ?,"Acne is most common in teenagers, but it can happen at any age, even in an infant. Three out of four teenagers have some acne. Hormonal changes probably cause increased oil in the skin. However, people in their 30s and 40s may also have acne."
838,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acne ?,"Call your doctor or a dermatologist if:
Self-care measures and over-the-counter medicine have not helped after several months Your acne is severe (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples or you have cysts) Your acne is getting worse You develop scars as your acne clears up
Call your baby's health care provider if your baby has acne that does not clear up on its own within 3 months."
839,What to expect if I have Acne  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acne usually goes away after the teenage years, but it may last into middle age. The condition often responds well to treatment after 6 - 8 weeks, but it may flare up from time to time.
Scarring may occur if severe acne is not treated. Some people, especially teenagers, can become very depressed if acne is not treated."
840,What are the symptoms of Acne vulgaris?,"Sometimes, the hair, sebum, and skin cells clump together into a plug. The bacteria in the plug causes swelling. Then when the plug starts to break down, a pimple grows.
There are many types of pimples. The most common types are:
Whiteheads: These are pimples that stay under the surface of the skin.
Blackheads: These pimples rise to the skin's surface and look black. The black color is not from dirt.
Papules: These are small pink bumps that can be tender.
Pustules: These pimples are red at the bottom and have pus on top.
Nodules: These are large, painful, solid pimples that are deep in the skin.
Cysts: These deep, painful, pus-filled pimples can cause scars."
841,What causes Acne vulgaris?,"The cause of acne is unknown. Doctors think certain factors might cause it: The hormone increase in teenage years (this can cause the oil glands to plug up more often)
Hormone changes during pregnancy Starting or stopping birth control pills Heredity (if your parents had acne, you might get it, too) Some types of medicine Greasy makeup
There are many myths about what causes acne. Dirty skin and stress do not cause acne. Also, chocolate and greasy foods do not cause acne in most people."
842,Who is at highest risk for Acne vulgaris?,Acne is the most common skin disease. People of all races and ages get acne. But it is most common in teenagers and young adults. An estimated 80 percent of all people between the ages of 11 and 30 have acne outbreaks at some point. Some people in their forties and fifties still get acne.
843,What are some precautions against Acne vulgaris?,"Some things can make acne worse:
Changing hormone levels in teenage girls and adult women 2 to 7 days before their period starts Pressure from bike helmets, backpacks, or tight collars Pollution and high humidity Squeezing or picking at pimples Hard scrubbing of the skin.
Here are some ways to care for skin if you have acne:
Clean skin gently: Use a mild cleanser in the morning, evening, and after heavy workouts. Scrubbing the skin does not stop acne. It can even make the problem worse. Try not to touch your skin: People who squeeze, pinch, or pick their pimples can get scars or dark spots on their skin. Shave carefully: If you shave, you can try both electric and safety razors to see which works best. With safety razors, use a sharp blade. Also, it helps to soften your beard with soap and water before putting on shaving cream. Shave lightly and only when you have to. Stay out of the sun: Many acne medicines can make people more likely to sunburn. Being in the sun a lot can also make skin wrinkle and raise the risk of skin cancer. Choose makeup carefully: All makeup should be oil free. Look for the word noncomedogenic on the label. This means that the makeup will not clog up your pores. But some people still get acne even if they use these products."
844,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acne vulgaris ?,"Call your doctor or a dermatologist if:
Self-care measures and over-the-counter medicine have not helped after several months Your acne is severe (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples or you have cysts) Your acne is getting worse You develop scars as your acne clears up
Call your baby's health care provider if your baby has acne that does not clear up on its own within 3 months."

846,What are the symptoms of Acrodermatitis?,"Rash or patch on skin Brownish-red or copper-colored patch that is firm and flat on top String of bumps may appear in a line Generally not itchy Rash looks the same on both sides of the body Rash may appear on the palms and soles -- it does not occur on the back, chest, or belly area (this is one of the ways it is identified -- by the absence of the rash from the trunk of the body)
Other symptoms that may appear include:
Swollen abdomen Swollen lymph nodes Tender lymph nodes"
847,What causes Acrodermatitis?,"The cause of acrodermatitis is poorly understood, but its link with other infections is well- documented.
In Italian children, acrodermatitis is seen frequently with hepatitis B, but this link is rarely seen in the United States. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, mononucleosis) is the virus most often associated with acrodermatitis. Other associated viruses inclcude, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and some live virus vaccines.
A rare, genetic form of acrodermatitis is acrodermatitis enteropathica. In this disorder, zinc is poorly absorbed from the diet. Adding zinc supplements to the diet improves the condition. This form of the disorder can be associated with other abnormalities and development delays."
848,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acrodermatitis ?,Call your health care provider if your child has signs of this condition.
849,What to expect if I have Acrodermatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acrodermatitis usually disappears on its own without treatment or complication. However, the associated conditions must be watched carefully."

They begin as flat and scaly areas Later they develop a hard and wart-like or gritty, rough, and ""sandpapery"" surface -- may develop a horn-like texture
The skin lesion may be easier to feel than to see."
851,What causes Actinic keratosis?,"Actinic keratosis is caused by sun exposure, but it takes many years or decades to develop."
852,Who is at highest risk for Actinic keratosis ?,"Risk factors for actinic keratosis include:
Having fair skin, blue or green eyes, or blond or red hair History of kidney or other solid organ transplant (people who take medicines that suppress the immune system) Long-term, daily sun exposure (for example, if you work outdoors) Multiple, severe sunburns early in life Older age"

Removal of the growth is usually effective."
855,What are the symptoms of Actinomycosis?,"Draining sores in the skin, especially on the chest wall from lung infection with Actinomyces Fever Minimal or no pain Swelling or a hard, red to reddish-purple lump on the face or upper neck Weight loss"
856,What causes Actinomycosis?,"Actinomycosis is usually caused by an anaerobic bacteria called Actinomyces israelii, which is a common and normally not disease-causing (nonpathogenic) organism found in the nose and throat. Because of the bacteria's normal location in the nose and throat, actinomycosis most commonly appears in the face and neck. However, the infection can sometimes occur in the chest (pulmonary actinomycosis), abdomen, pelvis, or other areas of the body. The infection is not contagious. Symptoms occur when the bacteria enters the facial tissues after trauma, surgery, or infection. A common triggering causes is dental abscess or oral surgery. The infection has also been seen in certain women who have had an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. Once in the tissue, it forms an abscess, producing a hard, red to reddish-purple lump, often on the jaw, from which comes the condition's common name, ""lumpy jaw."" Eventually, the abscess breaks through the skin surface to produce a draining sinus tract."

870,What are the symptoms of Hair loss?,"Hair loss usually develops gradually and may be patchy or all over (diffuse). You lose roughly 100 hairs from your head every day. The average scalp contains about 100,000 hairs."
871,What causes Hair loss?,"A sudden physical or emotional stress may cause one-half to three-quarters of the hair throughout your scalp to shed (called Telogen effluvium). You will notice hair coming out in handfuls while you shampoo, comb, or run your hands through your hair. You may not notice this for weeks to months after the episode of stress. The hair shedding will decrease over 6 - 8 months.
Cause of this type of hair loss are:
Childbirth Crash diets, especially those that do not contain enough protein High fever or severe infection Major surgery, major illness, sudden blood loss A number of medications, including retinoids, birth control pills, beta-blockers, certain antidepressants, NSAIDs (including iburpofen) and calcium channel blockers Severe emotional stress
Other possible causes of hair loss, especially if it is in an unusual pattern, include:
Alopecia areata -- bald patches that develop on the scalp, beard, and, possibly, eyebrows. Eyelashes may fall out as well. Anemia Autoimmune conditions such as lupus Burns Certain infectious diseases such as syphilis Excessive shampooing and blow-drying Hormone changes Nervous habits such as continual hair pulling or scalp rubbing Radiation therapy Thyroid diseases Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp) Tumor of the ovary or adrenal glands"
872,Who is at highest risk for Alopecia ?,"Some women ages 30 - 60 may notice a thinning of the hair that affects the entire scalp. The hair loss may be heavier at first, and then gradually slow or stop. There is no known cause for this type of hair loss.
Both men and women tend to lose hair thickness and amount as they age. Baldness is not usually caused by a disease. It is related to aging, heredity, and changes in the hormome, testosterone. Inherited or ""pattern baldness"" affects many more men than women. About one-half of men begin to bald by the time they are 30 years old, and most are either bald or have a balding pattern by age 60."
873,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alopecia ?,"Call your doctor if:
You are losing hair in an unusual pattern You are losing hair rapidly or at an early age (for example, in your teens or twenties) You have any pain or itching with the hair loss The skin on your scalp under the involved area is red, scaly, or otherwise abnormal You have acne, facial hair, or an abnormal menstrual cycle You are a woman and have male pattern baldness You have bald spots on your beard or eyebrows You have been gaining weight or have muscle weakness, intolerance to cold temperatures, or fatigue"
874,What to expect if I have Alopecia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A careful medical history and examination of the hair and scalp are usually enough to diagnose the cause of your hair loss.
Your doctor will ask detailed questions such as:
Are you losing hair only from your scalp or from other parts of your body as well? Is there a pattern to the hair loss, like a receding hairline or thinning or bald areas on the crown, or is the hair loss throughout your head? Have you had a recent illness or high fever ? Do you dye your hair ? Do you blow dry your hair? How often? How often do you shampoo your hair? What kind of shampoo, hair spray, gel, or other product do you put on your hair? Have you been under unusual stress lately? Do you have nervous habits that include hair pulling or scalp rubbing? Do you have any other symptoms like itching, flaking, or redness of your scalp? What medications do you take, including over-the-counter drugs?
Tests that may be performed (but are rarely needed) include:
Blood tests to rule out disease Microscopic examination of a plucked hair Skin biopsy
Ringworm on the scalp may require the use of an oral drug, such as griseofulvin. Creams and lotions applied to the affected area may not get into the hair follicles to kill the fungus."
875,What are the symptoms of Angioma?,"Skin angioma: Skin angioma can be diagnosed by your dermatologist. Most hemangiomas are on the face and neck. The usual signs are the following:
A red to reddish-purple, raised sore on the skin A massive, raised tumor with blood vessels
Internal organ angioma: Patients with internal organ angiomas may not feel any discomfort at the beginning. When the angioma grows larger, some symptoms may appear including:
Pain: This is due to the compression of the angioma on normal tissues. Bleeding: The walls of angiomas are very weak. Angioma's have a high risk of rupturing and bleeding. If it bleeds, it is dangerous and can cause death. Dysfunction of the internal organs: In the liver, the angioma can cause liver dysfunction and appear as jaundice and dyspepsia. In the brain, large angiomas can actually compress important nerves and may cause feeling disorders, movements disorders and even hemiplegia."
876,Who is at highest risk for Angioma ?,"Data suggests that risk factor statistics for angiomas include:
There is a 1 in 200 chance of having a cavernous angioma if the parent has a solitary cavernous angioma in the US There is a 50% chance of having a cavernous angioma if the parent has a multiple cavernous angiomas in the US"
877,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Angioma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of an angioma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seek urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Secondary infection of a skin angioma Local severe pain: such as severe headache, severe abdominal pain."
878,What to expect if I have Angioma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Skin angioma: Small, superficial hemangiomas often disappear on their own. About 50% go away by age 5, and 90% are gone by age 9.
Internal organ angioma: The prognosis of internal organ angioma depends on the location, the size and whether the angioma rupture or not."
879,What are the symptoms of Aspergillosis?,"Symptoms depend on the type of infection.Symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may include:
Cough Coughing up blood or brownish mucus plugs Fever General ill feeling (malaise) Wheezing Weight loss
Other symptoms depend on the part of the body affected, and may include:
Blood in the urine Bone pain Chest pain Chills Decreased urine output Headaches Increased phlegm production, which may be bloody Shortness of breath Skin sores (lesions) Vision problems"
880,What causes Aspergillosis?,"Aspergillosis is caused by a fungus (Aspergillus), which is commonly found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation. It can also be found on marijuana leaves.
Although most people are often exposed to aspergillus, infections caused by the fungus rarely occur in people who have a normal immune system. The rare infections caused by aspergillus include pneumonia and fungus ball (aspergilloma).There are several forms of aspergillosis:
Pulmonary aspergillosis - allergic bronchopulmonary type is an allergic reaction to the fungus that usually develops in people who already have lung problems (such as asthma or cystic fibrosis). Aspergilloma is a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung scarring (such as tuberculosis or lung abscess). Pulmonary aspergillosis - invasive type is a serious infection with pneumonia that can spread to other parts of the body. This infection almost always occurs in people with a weakened immune system due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medications that lower the number of normal white blood cells or weaken the immune system."
881,Who is at highest risk for Aspergillosis ?,"Persons with a compromised immune system are at highest risk for developing a fungal infection like aspergillosis. In rare cases, a person with a normal immune system may become infected."
882,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Aspergillosis ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of aspergillosis or if you have a weakened immune system and develop a fever.
883,What to expect if I have Aspergillosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, people with allergic aspergillosis usually get better over time. It is common for the disease to come back (relapse) and need repeat treatment.If invasive aspergillosis does not get better with drug treatment, it eventually leads to death. What happens to a person with invasive aspergillosis also depends on their disease and immune system function."
884,What are the symptoms of Ataxia telangiectasia?,"Decreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood
Ataxic gait (cerebellar ataxia) Jerky gait Unsteady
Decreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10-12 Delayed walking Discoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlight Discoloration of skin (coffee-with-milk colored spots) Enlarged blood vessels in skin of nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and knee Enlarged blood vessels in the whites of the eyes Jerky or abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) late in the disease Premature graying of the hair Seizures Sensitivity to radiation, including medical x-rays Severe respiratory infections that keep coming back (recurring)"
885,What causes Ataxia telangiectasia?,"Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. It is an autosomal recessive trait. This means that both parents must provide a defective gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder.
The disease results from defects in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Defects in this gene can lead to abnormal cell death in various places of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement.
Boys and girls are equally affected."
886,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ataxia telangiectasia ?,Call your health care provider if your child develops symptoms of this disorder.
887,What to expect if I have Ataxia telangiectasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Early death is common, but life expectancy varies.
Because persons with this condition are very sensitive to radiation, they should never be given radiation therapy, and no unnecessary x-rays should be done."
888,What are the symptoms of Athlete's foot?,"The most common symptom is cracked, flaking, peeling skin between the toes or side of the foot. Other symptoms can include:
Red and itchy skin Burning or stinging pain Blisters that ooze or get crusty
If the fungus spreads to your nails, they can become discolored, thick, and even crumble. Athlete's foot may occur at the same time as other fungal skin infections such as ringworm or jock itch."
889,What causes Athlete's foot?,"Athlete's foot occurs when a certain fungus grows on your skin in your feet. In addition to the toes, it may also occur on the heels, palms, and between the fingers.
Athlete's foot is the most common type of tinea fungal infections. The fungus thrives in warm, moist areas. Your risk for getting athlete's foot increases if you:
Wear closed shoes, especially if they are plastic-lined Keep your feet wet for prolonged periods of time Sweat a lot Develop a minor skin or nail injury
Athlete's foot is contagious, and can be passed through direct contact, or contact with items such as shoes, stockings, and shower or pool surfaces."
890,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Athlete%27s foot ?,"Call your doctor right away if:
Your foot is swollen and warm to the touch, especially if there are red streaks. These are signs of a possible bacterial infection. Other signs include pus, drainage, and fever. You have diabetes or a weakened immune system and develop athlete's foot.
Also call your doctor if athlete's foot symptoms do not go away within 2- 4 weeks of self-care treatments."
891,What to expect if I have Athlete%27s foot  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Athlete's foot infections range from mild to severe and may last a short or long time. They may persist or recur, but they generally respond well to treatment. Long-term medication and preventive measures may be needed"
892,What are the symptoms of Atopic dermatitis?,"Skin changes may include:
Blisters with oozing and crusting Dry skin all over the body or areas of bumpy skin on the back of the arms and front of the thighs Ear discharge or bleeding Raw areas of the skin from scratching Skin coloring changes, such as more or less color than the normal skin tone Skin redness or inflammation around the blisters Thickened or leather-like areas (called lichenification), which can occur after long-term irritation and scratching The type and location of the rash can depend on the age of the patient:
In children younger than age 2, skin lesions begin on the face, scalp, hands, and feet. The rash is often itchy and bubble, ooze, or form crusts.
In older children and adults, the rash is more often seen on the inside of the knees and elbow. It can also appear on the neck, hands, and feet. Rashes may occur anywhere on the body during a bad outbreak. Intense itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the ""itch that rashes"" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching."
893,What causes Atopic dermatitis?,"Atopic dermatitis is due to a skin reaction (similar to an allergy) in the skin. The reaction leads to ongoing swelling and redness. People with atopic dermititis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks certain proteins.
Atopic dermatitis is most common in infants. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood.
People with atopic dermatitis often have asthma or seasonal allergies. There is often a family history of allergies such as asthma, hay fever, or eczema. People with atopic dermatitis often test positive to allergy skin tests.
The following can make atopic dermatitis symptoms worse:
Allergies to pollen, mold, dust mites, or animals Cold and dry air in the winter Colds or the flu Contact with irritants and chemicals Contact with rough materials, such as wool Dry skin Emotional stress Drying out of the skin from taking too many baths or showers and swimming too often Getting too hot or too cold, as well as sudden changes of temperature Perfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps"
894,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atopic dermatitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Atopic dermatitis does not get better with home care Symptoms get worse or treatment does not work You have signs of infection (such as fever, redness, or pain)"
895,What to expect if I have Atopic dermatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Atopic dermatitis is a long-term condition. You can control it with treatment, by avoiding irritants, and by keeping the skin well-moisturized. In children, the condition often starts to go away around age 5 - 6, but flare-ups will often occur. In adults, the problem is generally a long-term or returning condition. Atopic dermatitis may be harder to control if it:
Begins at an early age Involves a large amount of the body Occurs along with allergic rhinitis and asthma Occurs in someone with a family history of eczema"
896,What are the symptoms of Basal cell carcinoma?,"A change on the skin is the most common sign of skin cancer. This may be a new growth, a sore that doesn't heal, or a change in an old growth. Sometimes skin cancer is painful, but usually it is not. Not all skin cancers look the same. Skin changes to watch for:
Small, smooth, shiny, pale, or waxy lump
Firm, red lump
Sore or lump that bleeds or develops a crust or a scab
Flat red spot that is rough, dry, or scaly and may become itchy or tender
Red or brown patch that is rough and scaly"
897,Who is at highest risk for Basal cell carcinoma ?,"Doctors cannot explain why one person develops skin cancer and another does not, but we do know that skin cancer is not contagious. You cannot ""catch"" it from another person. However, research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop skin cancer. The following are risk factors for skin cancer:
Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation
UV radiation comes from the sun, sunlamps, tanning beds, or tanning booths. A person's risk of skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to UV radiation. Most skin cancer appears after age 50, but the sun damages the skin from an early age. UV radiation affects everyone. But people who have fair skin that freckles or burns easily are at greater risk. These people often also have red or blond hair and light -colored eyes. But even people who tan can get skin cancer. People who live in areas that get high levels of UV radiation have a higher risk of skin cancer. In the United States, areas in the south (such as Texas and Florida) get more UV radiation than areas in the north (such as Minnesota). Also, people who live in the mountains get high levels of UV radiation. UV radiation is present even in cold weather or on a cloudy day.
Scars or burns on the skin Infection with certain human papillomaviruses (HPV) Exposure to arsenic at work Chronic skin inflammation or skin ulcers Diseases that make the skin sensitive to the sun, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, and basal cell nevus syndrome Radiation therapy Medical conditions or drugs that suppress the immune system Personal history of one or more skin cancers Family history of skin cancer Actinic keratosis
Actinic keratosis is a type of flat, scaly growth on the skin. It is most often found on areas exposed to the sun, especially the face and the backs of the hands. The growths may appear as rough red or brown patches on the skin. They may also appear as cracking or peeling of the lower lip that does not heal. Without treatment, a small number of these scaly growths may turn into squamous cell cancer.
Bowen's disease
Bowen's disease is a type of scaly or thickened patch on the skin. It may turn into squamous cell skin cancer."
898,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Basal cell carcinoma ?,"If the biopsy shows that you have cancer, your doctor needs to know the extent (stage) of the disease. The stage is based on:
The size of the growth How deeply it has grown beneath the top layer of skin Whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body
The stages of skin cancer range from Stage 0 (when the cancer involves only the top layer of skin) to Stage IV (when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body)."
899,What to expect if I have Basal cell carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Skin cancer has a better prognosis, or outcome, than most other types of cancer.
Follow-up care after treatment for skin cancer is important. Your doctor will monitor your recovery and check for new skin cancer. New skin cancers are more common than having a treated skin cancer spread. Regular checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. Between scheduled visits, you should check your skin regularly. You should contact the doctor if you notice anything unusual. It also is important to follow your doctor's advice about how to reduce your risk of developing skin cancer again."
900,What are the symptoms of Bedsore?,"The symptoms of a Bedsore depend on how severe it is. Bedsores are classified in the following stages. Stage I (earliest signs) and Stage IV (worst):
Stage I: A reddened area on the skin that, when pressed, does not turn white. This indicates that a pressure ulcer is starting to develop. Stage II: The skin blisters or forms an open sore. The area around the sore may be red and irritated. Stage III: The skin breakdown now looks like a crater. There is damage to the tissue below the skin. Stage IV: The pressure ulcer has become so deep that there is damage to the muscle and bone, and sometimes to tendons and joints."
901,Who is at highest risk for Bedsore ?,"People at the highest risk for developing a Bedsore include:
Individuals who are bedridden Individuals bound to a wheelchair Malnourishment Risk increases with age Individuals with a injury or disease that may limit mobility (i.e. spinal cord injury) Individuals with a condition that may inhibit blood flow to certain areas of the body (i.e. diabetes) Individuals with urinary or bowel incontinence Individuals with a mental condition that may affect mobility (i.e. Alzheimer's)"
902,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bedsore ?,"Contact your health care provider if an area of the skin blisters or forms an open sore. Contact the provider immediately if there are any signs of an infection. An infection can spread to the rest of the body and cause serious problems. Signs of an infected ulcer include:
A foul odor from the ulcer Redness and tenderness around the ulcer Skin close to the ulcer is warm and swollen
Fever, weakness, and confusion are signs that the infection may have spread to the blood or elsewhere in the body."
903,What are the symptoms of Behçet's disease?,"Signs and symptoms of Behçet's disease vary from person to person, depending on the blood vessels affected. Many patients show multiple organ damages. Like other autoimmue diseases, signs and symptoms come and go.
Painful mouth sores: These are the most common sign of Behçet's disease. Mouth sores turn quickly from lesion to ulcers and heal in 7~21 days. Skin lesions: Skin lesions in patients with Behçet's disease vary, from acne-like sores to red tender nodules. Brain: When Behçet's disease affect brain, it leads to headache, fever, disorientation, poor balance, even stroke. Digestive system: Patients with Behçet's disease may show symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea or bleeding. Eyes: Behçet's disease may cause inflammation in the eye, such as uveitis. Joints: Patients with Behçet's disease may have joint swelling and joint pain when joints are affected with inflammination. Vascular system: Inflammination may occur on veins and large arteries, leading redness, pain and swelling in the arms or legs, even aneurysms and narrowing or blockage of the vessel. Genitals: Patients with Behçet's disease may develop sores on their genitals, feeling pain and leaving scars.
Diseases with similar symptoms include:
Erythema nodosum Inflammatory bowel disease Peptic ulcer Acute febrile neutrophilic Lupus erythematosus"
904,What causes Behçet's disease?,"The exact cause of Behçet's disease is unknown. Most symptoms of the disease are caused by inflammation of the blood vessels. Inflammation is a characteristic reaction of the body to injury or disease and is marked by four signs: swelling, redness, heat, and pain. Doctors think that an autoinflammatory reaction may cause the blood vessels to become inflamed, but they do not know what triggers this reaction. Under normal conditions, the immune system protects the body from diseases and infections by killing harmful ""foreign"" substances, such as germs, that enter the body. In an autoimmune reaction, the immune system mistakenly attacks and harms the body's own tissues.
Behçet's disease is not contagious; it is not spread from one person to another. Researchers think that two factors are important for a person to get Behçet's disease. First, it is believed that abnormalities of the immune system make some people susceptible to the disease. Scientists think that this susceptibility may be inherited; that is, it may be due to one or more specific genes. Second, something in the environment, possibly a bacterium or virus, might trigger or activate the disease in susceptible people."
905,Who is at highest risk for Beh%C3%A7et%27s disease ?,"The underlying cause of Behçet’s disease is not clear. It is suggested that the following factors may be associated with the disease.
Genetic predisposition: Researches demonstrate that the presence of the gene HLA–B51 is a risk factor for Behçet's disease. Age: Behçet's disease can affect people in any age, but the most common age is 20~30 years old. Gender: Behçet's disease most commonly affects men than women. Behçet's disease is more common in Middle East and Japan then in other race. It is rare in America."
906,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Beh%C3%A7et%27s disease ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of Behçet's disease develop. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Sever headache Massive hemorrhage of gastrointestinal tract"
907,What to expect if I have Beh%C3%A7et%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Behçet's disease usually runs a protracted course and the mortality is low. Prognosis depends on:
Gender: Men with Behçet's disease has poorer prognosis than women. Whether the patient develops complications."
908,What are the symptoms of Birthmarks-pigmented?,"Each type of birthmark has its own appearance:
Cafe-au-lait spots are light tan, the color of coffee with milk. Moles are small clusters of colored skin cells. Mongolian spots (also called Mongolian blue spots) are usually bluish or bruised-looking. They usually appear over the lower back or buttocks, but can also appear in other areas, including the trunk or arms.
Other symptoms of birthmarks:
Abnormally dark or light skin Contain hair Skin lesion Skin lumps Textured -- smooth, flat, raised, or wrinkled"
909,Who is at highest risk for Birthmarks-pigmented ?,"Cafe-au-lait spots may occur in people with the genetic disorder, neurofibromatosis. Nearly everyone has moles, which usually appear after birth. Mongolian spots are more commonly seen in darker-skinned populations."
910,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Birthmarks-pigmented ?,"Have any birthmarks examined by a health care provider. Report any changes in the birthmark to your health care provider, including:
Bleeding Color change Inflammation Itching Open sore (ulceration) Pain Size change Texture change"
911,What to expect if I have Birthmarks-pigmented  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Large moles that are present at birth (congenital nevi) are more likely to become skin cancer (malignant melanoma). This is especially true if the mole covers an area larger than the size of a fist. The cancer risk is related to the size, location, shape, and color of the mole.
Mongolian spots may persist for months or years. They do NOT become cancer or develop other symptoms."
912,What are the symptoms of Birthmarks-red?,"Skin markings that look like blood vessels Skin rash or lesion that is red
The different types of birthmark have their own appearance and typical location:
Cavernous hemangiomas may appear as a red-blue spongy mass of tissue filled with blood. Port-wine stains are most often located on the face. The size varies from very small to over half of the body surface. Salmon patches are small, pink, flat spots. They are small blood vessels (capillaries) that are visible through the skin. They are most common on the forehead, eyelids, upper lip, between the eyebrows, and on the back of the neck. Salmon patches may be more noticeable when the infant cries or during temperature changes. Strawberry hemangiomas may appear anywhere on the body, but are most common on the neck and face. They consist of small, closely packed blood vessels."
913,What causes Birthmarks-red?,"There are two main categories of birthmarks.
Red birthmarks are made up of blood vessels close to the skin surface, and are called vascular birthmarks. Pigmented birthmarks are areas in which the color of the birthmark is different from the color of the rest of the skin.
Hemangiomas are a common vascular birthmark. Their cause is unknown. The color results from the development of blood vessels at the site.
Strawberry hemangiomas (strawberry mark, nevus vascularis, capillary hemangioma, hemangioma simplex) may develop several weeks after birth. Cavernous hemangiomas (angioma cavernosum, cavernoma) are similar to strawberry hemangiomas but they are deeper. Salmon patches (stork bites) are extremely common, appearing on 30-50% of newborns. A port-wine stain is a flat hemangioma made of dilated blood capillaries. Port wine stains on the face may be associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome."
914,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Birthmarks-red ?,"Have all birthmarks examined by a health care provider to determine the treatment, possible complications, and likely outcome."
915,What to expect if I have Birthmarks-red  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Birthmarks rarely cause problems, other than cosmetic changes. Many birthmarks go away on their own by the time a child is of school age, but some are permanent.
Strawberry hemangiomas usually grow quickly, stay the same size, and then go away. Ninety-five percent of strawberry hemangiomas disappear by the time the child is 9 years old. However, there may be some slight discoloration or puckering of the skin where a strawberry hemangioma was. Some cavernous hemangiomas disappear on their own, usually as a child approaches school age. Port wine stains are often permanent. Salmon patches often fade as the infant grows. Patches on the back of the neck may not fade, but are usually not noticeable as the hair grows."
916,What are the symptoms of Blastomycosis?,"Lung infection may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms may be seen if the infection spreads. Symptoms may include:
Bone pain Chest pain Cough (may produce brown or bloody mucus) Fatigue Fever General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) Joint pain Muscle pain Night sweats Shortness of breath Sweating Unintentional weight loss
Skin symptoms are most often seen when the infection spreads beyond the lungs. You may have painless sores that look like warts or ulcers. They may:
Be grey to violet colored Bleed easily Occur in the nose or mouth"
917,What causes Blastomycosis?,"You can get blastomyocosis by breathing in this fungus. It is found in moist soil, most commonly where there is rotting vegetation. The fungus enters the body through the lungs, infecting them. The fungus then spreads (disseminates) to other areas of the body. The infection may affect the skin, bones and joints, and other areas.
Blastomycosis is rare. It is found in the central and southeastern United States, and in Canada, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Africa.
Being around infected soil is the key risk factor. The disease usually affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or who have had an organ transplant. Men are more likely to be affected than women."
918,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Blastomycosis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of blastomycosis.
919,What to expect if I have Blastomycosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Patients with minor skin sores (lesions) and relatively mild lung infections usually recover completely. If the infection is not treated, it can become severe enough to cause death. Skin sores may lead to permanent scars."
920,What are the symptoms of Boil?,"A boil may begin as a tender, pinkish-red, swollen, firm area in the skin. Over time, it will feel like a water-filled balloon or cyst.
Pain gets worse as it fills with pus and dead tissue, and improves as it drains. It may drain on its own. More often the patient or someone else opens the boil.
The boil:
Is usually pea-sized, but may be as large as a golf ball May develop white or yellow centers (pustules) May join with another boil or spread to other skin areas May grow quickly May weep, ooze, or crust
Other symptoms may include:
Fatigue Fever General ill-feeling Itching before the boil develops Skin redness around the boil"
921,What causes Boil?,"Boils are very common. They are generally caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, but they may be caused by other bacteria or fungi found on the skin's surface. Damage to the hair follicle allows these bacteria to enter deeper into the tissues of the follicle and the tissue underneath.
Boils may occur in the hair follicles anywhere on the body. They are most common on the face, neck, armpit, buttocks, and thighs. There can be one or many boils."
922,What to expect if I have Boil  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some people have repeated abscesses and are unable to prevent them.
Boils can be very painful if they occur in areas like the ear canal or nose. A health care provider should treat boils of the nose.
Boils that form close together may expand and join, causing a condition called carbunculosis."
923,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Boil ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if boils:
Appear on the face or spine Do not heal with home treatment within 1 week Occur along with a fever, red streaks coming out from the sore, large fluid collections around the boil, or other symptoms"
924,What are the symptoms of Bourbon virus infection?,"Because there have been few cases identified thus far, scientists are still learning about possible symptoms caused by this new virus. People diagnosed with Bourbon virus disease had symptoms including fever, tiredness, rash, headache, other body aches, nausea, and vomiting. They also had low blood counts for cells that fight infection and help prevent bleeding."
925,What causes Bourbon virus infection?,"Bourbon virus infection is caused by a type of thogotovirus, which belongs to Orthomyxoviridae family."
926,Who is at highest risk for Bourbon virus infection ?,"People likely become infected with Bourbon virus when they are bitten by a tick or other insect. Therefore, people who do not take steps to protect themselves from tick or insect bites when they work or spend time outside may be more likely to be infected."
927,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bourbon virus infection ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of Bourbon virus infection"
928,What to expect if I have Bourbon virus infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,From 2014-2017 only 5 cases have been reported with Bourbon virus infection and all resulted in death.
929,What are the symptoms of Bullous pemphigoid?,"Some people may have no symptoms, others may have mild redness and irration.
In severe cases, they are multiple blisters, called bullae. The blisters are usually located on the arms, legs, or middle of the body. About one-third of persons with bullous pemphigoid also develop blisters in the mouth. The blisters may break open and form ulcers or open sores.
Other symptoms may include:
Itching Rashes Mouth sores Bleeding gums"
930,What causes Bullous pemphigoid?,"The cause is not known, but may be related to immune system disorders, certain other diseases, or use of some medications."
931,Who is at highest risk for Bullous pemphigoid ?,"Bullous pemphigoid usually occurs in elderly persons and is rare in young people. Symptoms come and go. In most patients, the condition goes away within 6 years."
932,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bullous pemphigoid ?,"Call your doctor for an appointment if you have:
Unexplained blisters on your skin An itchy rash that continues despite home treatment"
933,What to expect if I have Bullous pemphigoid  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Bullous pemphigoid usually responds well to treatment. Most patients may stop taking medicine after several years. However, the disease sometimes returns after treatment is stopped."
934,What are the symptoms of Burns?,"Blisters Pain (the degree of pain is not related to the severity of the burn -- the most serious burns can be painless) Peeling skin Red skin Shock (watch for pale and clammy skin, weakness, bluish lips and fingernails, and a drop in alertness) Swelling White or charred skin
Symptoms of an airways burn:
Charred mouth; burned lips Burns on the head, face, or neck Wheezing Change in voice Difficulty breathing; coughing Singed nose hairs or eyebrows Dark, carbon -stained mucus"
935,What causes Burns?,"Burns can be caused by dry heat (like fire), wet heat (such as steam or hot liquids), radiation, friction, heated objects, the sun, electricity, or chemicals.
Thermal burns are the most common type. Thermal burns occur when hot metals, scalding liquids, steam, or flames come in contact with your skin. These are frequently the result of fires, automobile accidents, playing with matches, improperly stored gasoline, space heaters, and electrical malfunctions. Other causes include unsafe handling of firecrackers and kitchen accidents (such as a child climbing on top of a stove or grabbing a hot iron).
Burns to your airways can be caused by inhaling smoke, steam, superheated air, or toxic fumes, often in a poorly ventilated space.
Burns in children are sometimes traced to parental abuse."
936,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Burns ?,"Call 911 if:
The burn is extensive (the size of your palm or larger). The burn is severe (third degree). You aren't sure how serious it is. The burn is caused by chemicals or electricity. The person shows signs of shock. The person inhaled smoke. Physical abuse is the known or suspected cause of the burn. There are other symptoms associated with the burns
Call a doctor if your pain is still present after 48 hours.
Call immediately if signs of infection develop. These signs include increased pain, redness, swelling, drainage or pus from the burn, swollen lymph nodes, red streaks spreading from the burn, or fever.
Also call immediately if there are signs of dehydration: thirst, dry skin, dizziness, lightheadedness, or decreased urination. Children, elderly, and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, HIV) should be seen right away."
937,What causes Candidiasis?,"Most women will have a vaginal yeast infection at some time. Candida albicans is a common type of fungus. It is often present in small amounts in the vagina, mouth, digestive tract, and on the skin. Usually it does not cause disease or symptoms. Candida and the many other germs or microorganisms that normally live in the vagina keep each other in balance. However, when the vagina has certain favorable conditions, the number of Candida albicans increases, leading to a yeast infection. Some of these favorable conditions include:
Antibiotics used to treat other types of infections change the normal balance between organisms in the vagina by decreasing the number of protective bacteria. Being pregnant, having diabetes, or being obese all create conditions that help yeast grow more easily.
Vaginal candidiasis is not a sexually transmitted disease. However, a small number of men will develop symptoms such as itching and a rash on the penis after having sexual contact with an infected partner. Having many vaginal yeast infections may be a sign of other health problems. Other vaginal infections and discharges can be mistaken for a vaginal yeast infection. Repeat infections that occur immediately after treatment, or a yeast infection that does not respond to any treatment, may be an early sign that a person is infected with HIV."
938,What are the symptoms of Candidiasis?,"Abnormal vaginal discharge Ranges from a slightly watery, white discharge to a thick, white, chunky discharge (like cottage cheese) Pain with intercourse Painful urination Redness and swelling of the vulva Vaginal and labial itching, burning"
939,Who is at highest risk for Candidiasis ?,"Antibiotics used to treat other types of infections change the normal balance between organisms in the vagina by decreasing the number of protective bacteria. Being pregnant, having diabetes, or being obese all create conditions that help yeast grow more easily."
940,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Candidiasis ?,"This is the first time that you have had symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection You are unsure of whether you have a yeast infection (if you are sure that you have a yeast infection, you can treat the disorder with over-the-counter medications) Your symptoms don't go away after using self-treatment vaginal creams You develop other symptoms"
941,What to expect if I have Candidiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The symptoms usually disappear completely with adequate treatment.
942,What are the symptoms of Carbuncle?,"A carbuncle is a swollen lump or mass under the skin. It may be the size of a pea or as large as a golf ball. The carbuncle may be red and irritated and might hurt when you touch it.
It may also:
Grow very fast Have a white or yellow center (contain pus) Weep, ooze, or crust Spread to other skin areas
Sometimes, other symptoms may occur. These may include:
Fatigue Fever General discomfort or sick feeling Skin itching before the carbuncle develops"
943,What causes Carbuncle?,"Most carbuncles are caused by the bacteria staphylococcus aureus. The infection is contagious and may spread to other areas of the body or other people.
A carbuncle is made up of several skin boils (furuncles). The infected mass is filled with fluid, pus, and dead tissue. Fluid may drain out of the carbuncle, but sometimes the mass is so deep that it cannot drain on its own.
Carbuncles may develop anywhere, but they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck. Men get carbuncles more often than women."
944,Who is at highest risk for Carbuncle ?,"Because the condition is contagious, several family members may develop carbuncles at the same time. Often, the cause of a carbuncle cannot be determined.
You are more likely to get a carbuncle if you have:
Friction from clothing or shaving Poor hygiene Poor overall health
Persons with diabetes, dermatitis, and weakened immune systems are more likely to develop staph infections that can cause cabuncles."
945,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Carbuncle ?,"Call your health care provider if:
A carbuncles does not heal with home treatment within 2 weeks Carbuncles come back often A carbuncle is located on the face or spine You have a fever, red streaks running from the sore, a lot of swelling around the carbuncle, or pain that gets worse"
946,What to expect if I have Carbuncle  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Carbunculus may heal on their own. Others usually respond well to treatment. However, a carbuncle can return again and again for months or years following the first infection."
947,What are the symptoms of Cellulitis?,"Symptoms of cellulitis include:
Fever Pain or tenderness in the affected area Skin redness or inflammation that gets bigger as the infection spreads Skin sore or rash that starts suddenly, and grows quickly in the first 24 hours Tight, glossy, ""stretched"" appearance of the skin Warm skin in the the area of redness Signs of infection: Chills or shaking Fatigue General ill feeling Muscle aches and pains Warm skin Sweating
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Hair loss at the site of infection Joint stiffness caused by swelling of the tissue over the joint Nausea and vomiting"
948,What causes Cellulitis?,"Staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are the most common causes of cellulitis. Normal skin has many types of bacteria living on it. When there is a break in the skin, these bacteria can cause a skin infection. Skin in the infected area will become red, hot, irritated, and painful."
949,Who is at highest risk for Cellulitis ?,"Risk factors for cellulitis include:
Cracks or peeling skin between the toes History of peripheral vascular disease Injury or trauma with a break in the skin (skin wounds) Insect bites and stings, animal bites, or human bites Ulcers from certain diseases, including diabetes and vascular disease Use of corticosteroid medications or medications that suppress the immune system Wound from a recent surgery"
950,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cellulitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of cellulitis You are being treated for cellulitis and you develop new symptoms, such as persistent fever, drowsiness, lethargy, blistering over the cellulitis, or red streaks that spread. Seek medical attention immediately if the cellulitis is on your face."
951,What to expect if I have Cellulitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Cellulitis usually goes away with 7 - 10 days of antibiotics. Longer treatment may be needed if cellulitis is more severe. This may occur if you have a chronic diseases or your immune system is not working properly. People with fungal infections of the feet may have cellulitis that keeps coming back. The cracks in the skin from the fungal infection allows the bacteria entry to the skin.
952,What are the symptoms of Chiggers?,"The main symptoms are:
Severe itching Red pimple-like bumps or hives
Itching usually occurs several hours after the chiggers attach to the skin.
A skin rash may appear on the parts of the body that were exposed to the sun. It may stop where the underwear meets the legs. This is often a clue that the rash is due to chigger bites."
953,What causes Chiggers?,"Chiggers are found in certain outdoor areas, such as berry patches, tall grass and weeds, and woodland edges."
954,Who is at highest risk for Chiggers ?,"Chiggers bite humans around the waist, ankles, or in warm skin folds. Bites commonly occur in the summer and fall months."
955,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chiggers ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if the rash itches very badly, or if symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment."
956,What to expect if I have Chiggers  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,This condition heals itself without treatment.
957,What are the symptoms of Chronic cold urticaria?,"Symptom onset often occurs when individuals with cold urticaria are exposed to cold water or sudden drops in temperature. While most reactions occur at temperatures 40° F or lower, many people often experience worse reactions as their exposed skin is rewarming. Cold urticaria is more likely to occur when conditions are damp and windy. Cold urticaria symptoms vary in intensity. While some individuals only experience very minor reactions to cold, other individuals experience severe reactions. There is no exact timeframe over which cold urticaria can be said to go away. For some people, it will go away on its own after several months; however, other people may experience cold urticaria for years before seeing an improvement.
Some signs and symptoms of cold urticaria include:
Hives that are red and itchy. These hives result from exposing the skin to cold and typically last for half an hour Swelling of the hands when holding cold objects Swelling of the lips when eating cold foods In severe cases, the tongue and throat may swelland inhibit breathing
While some symptoms may only affect certain parts of the body, other people may experience symptoms that affect their whole body. Some of the more serious signs and symptoms of cold urticaria include:
Fainting Chills A faster than normal heartbeat Swelling of the arms, legs or torso
Severe reactions Exposure to cold can be dangerous for people who suffer from cold urticaria. It is especially dangerous when individuals swim in cold water since swimming exposes all of the individual’s skin to the cold. When this level of exposure occurs, the body releases high levels of histamine and other immune system chemicals. As a result of the release of all these chemicals, the individual’s blood pressure can drop, which may result in fainting, shock, and rarely, death. Individuals who suffer from cold urticaria and who choose to swim in cold water may lose consciousness as a result of the cold, which may lead to drowning."
958,What causes Chronic cold urticaria?,"Though it is not clear what causes cold urticaria, it appears that some people have hypersensitive skin cells. This means that their skin cells are more sensitive than a normal person's skin cells to things like temperature. This may be a result of either an inherited trait or an illness (for example, a virus). Since exposure to cold begins the immune response that releases histamine and other immune system chemicals, the skin may become itchy and exhibit redness and other symptoms."
959,Who is at highest risk for Chronic cold urticaria ?,"Cold urticaria does not discriminate against who experiences it, regardless of age or gender. However, some people are more likely to have cold urticaria:
Children and young adults. This population experiences a particular type of urticaria called primary acquired urticaria. It usually improves without treatment within two to three years, and is the most common type of urticaria.
Recent viral infection. Individuals who have had recent viral infections, such as mycoplasma pneumonia and mononucleosis, oftentimes experience cold urticaria following their infection.
Underlying health conditions. Some individuals who experience cold urticaria may have an underlying health problem, like rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis or cancer. This type of cold urticaria is known as secondary acquired urticaria, which is less common.
Inherited traits. In rare cases, individuals can inherit a condition called familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome. After exposure to cold, people who inherit this condition experience painful, itchy hives and flu-like symptoms."
960,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic cold urticaria ?,"Seek immediate assistance if you experience the following severe reactions after sudden exposure to cold:
Feeling light headed Difficulty breathing Throat swelling
If you notice mild skin reactions following exposure to cold, see a doctor. Your doctor can rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing the problem."
961,What are the symptoms of Congenital herpes?,"Herpes may only appear as a skin infection. Small, fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) may appear. These blisters rupture, crust over, and finally heal, often leaving a mild scar.
Herpes infection may also spread throughout the body (called disseminated herpes). In this type, the herpes virus can affect many different parts of the body.
Herpes infection in the brain is called herpes encephalitis The liver, lungs, and kidneys may also be involved There may or may not be blisters on the skin
Newborn infants with herpes that has spread to the brain or other parts of the body are often very sick.
Symptoms include:
Bleeding easily Breathing difficulties Blue appearance (cyanosis) Flaring of the nostrils Grunting Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Short periods without breathing (apneic episodes) Coma Neonatal jaundice Lethargy Low body temperature (hypothermia) Poor feeding Seizures Shock Skin lesions, fluid-filled blisters
Herpes that is caught in the period shortly after birth has symptoms similar to those of birth-acquired herpes.
Intrauterine herpes can cause:
Eye disease, such as inflammation of the retina (chorioretinitis) Severe brain damage Skin sores (lesions)"
962,What causes Congenital herpes?,"Newborn infants can become infected with herpes virus:
In the uterus (intrauterine herpes - this is very rare) Passing through the birth canal (birth-acquired herpes, the most common method of infection) Right after birth (postpartum) from kissing or having other contact with someone who has herpes mouth sores
If the mother has an active genital herpes infection at the time of delivery, the baby is more likely to become infected during birth. Some mothers may not be aware they have internal (inside the vagina) herpes sores.
Some people have had herpes infections in the past, but were not aware of it. These people, not knowing that they have herpes, may pass it to their baby.
Herpes type 2 (genital herpes) is the most common cause of herpes infection in newborn babies, but herpes type 1 (oral herpes) can also occur."
963,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital herpes ?,"If your baby has any symptoms of birth-acquired herpes, including skin lesions alone, have the baby seen by your health care provider promptly."
964,What to expect if I have Congenital herpes  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Infants with systemic herpes or encephalitis often do poorly, despite antiviral medications and early treatment.
In infants with skin disease, the vesicles may come back repeatedly even after treatment is finished. These recurrences put them at risk for learning disabilities, and may need to be treated."
965,What are the symptoms of Contact dermatitis?,"Itching (pruritus) of the skin in exposed areas Skin redness or inflammation in the exposed area Tenderness of the skin in the exposed area Localized swelling of the skin Warmth of the exposed area (may occur) Skin lesion or rash at the site of exposure Lesions of any type: redness, rash, papules (pimple-like), vesicles, and bullae (blisters) May involve oozing, draining, or crusting May become scaly, raw, or thickened"
966,What causes Contact dermatitis?,"Contact dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin caused by direct contact with an irritating or allergy-causing substance (irritant or allergen). Reactions may vary in the same person over time. A history of any type of allergies increases the risk for this condition.
Irritant dermatitis, the most common type of contact dermatitis, involves inflammation resulting from contact with acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents, solvents, or other chemicals. The reaction usually resembles a burn.
Allergic contact dermatitis, the second most common type of contact dermatitis, is caused by exposure to a substance or material to which you have become extra sensitive or allergic. The allergic reaction is often delayed, with the rash appearing 24 - 48 hours after exposure. The skin inflammation varies from mild irritation and redness to open sores, depending on the type of irritant, the body part affected, and your sensitivity.
Overtreatment dermatitis is a form of contact dermatitis that occurs when treatment for another skin disorder causes irritation.
Common allergens associated with contact dermatitis include:
Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac Other plants Nickel or other metals Medications
Antibiotics, especially those applied to the surface of the skin (topical) Topical anesthetics Other medications
Rubber or latex Cosmetics Fabrics and clothing Detergents Solvents Adhesives Fragrances, perfumes Other chemicals and substances"
967,Who is at highest risk for Contact dermatitis ?,"Contact dermatitis may involve a reaction to a substance that you are exposed to, or use repeatedly. Although there may be no initial reaction, regular use (for example, nail polish remover, preservatives in contact lens solutions, or repeated contact with metals in earring posts and the metal backs of watches) can eventually cause cause sensitivity and reaction to the product.
Some products cause a reaction only when they contact the skin and are exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include shaving lotions, sunscreens, sulfa ointments, some perfumes, coal tar products, and oil from the skin of a lime. A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed or insecticide spray, can cause contact dermatitis."
968,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Contact dermatitis ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms indicate contact dermatitis and it is severe or there is no improvement after treatment.
969,What to expect if I have Contact dermatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Contact dermatitis usually clears up without complications within 2 or 3 weeks, but may return if the substance or material that caused it cannot be identified or avoided. A change of occupation or occupational habits may be necessary if the disorder is caused by occupational exposure."
970,What are the symptoms of Contact Dermatitis?,"Symptoms vary depending on the cause and whether the dermatitis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. The same person may also have different symptoms over time.
Allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or only after months of being exposed to a substance.
The hands are a common site for contact dermatitis. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes often lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewellery can also cause skin problems in the area under it.
Itching of the skin in exposed areas is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe. Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain. Allergic dermatitis often causes a red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed, with the rash appearing 24 - 48 hours after exposure. The rash may:
Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters Feel warm and tender Ooze, drain, or crust Become scaly, raw, or thickened Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure."
971,What causes Contact Dermatitis?,"Irritant dermatitis is the most common type. It's caused by contact with acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. The reaction usually looks like a burn. Other irritants may include:
Cement
Hair dyes
Long-term exposure to wet diapers
Pesticides or weed killers
Rubber gloves
Shampoos
Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance or material to which you have become extra sensitive or allergic.
Common allergens include:
Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees
Antibiotics such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin
Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks)
Fabrics and clothing
Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers
Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions
Nickel or other metals (found in jewelelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts)
Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants
Rubber or latex gloves or shoes
Although you may not have a reaction to a substance when you are first exposed to it, regular use can eventually cause sensitivity and a reaction to the product.
Some products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include shaving lotions, sunscreens, sulfa ointments, some perfumes, coal tar products, and oil from the skin of a lime. A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed or insecticide spray, can cause contact dermatitis."
972,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Contact Dermatitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of contact dermatitis
It is severe
There is no improvement after treatment"
973,What to expect if I have Contact Dermatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Contact dermatitis usually clears up without complications in 2 or 3 weeks. However, it may return if the substance or material that caused it cannot be found or avoided. You may need to change your job or job habits if the disorder is caused by occupational exposure."
974,What are the symptoms of Corns & calluses?,"Skin is thick and hardened. Skin may be flaky and dry. Hardened, thick skin areas are found on hands, feet, or other areas that may be rubbed or pressed."
975,What causes Corns & calluses?,"Corns and calluses are caused by pressure or friction on skin. A corn is thickened skin on the top or side of a toe, usually from shoes that do not fit properly. A callus is thickened skin on your hands or the soles of your feet.
The thickening of the skin is a protective reaction. For example, farmers and rowers get callused hands that prevent them from getting painful blisters. People with bunions often develop a callus over the bunion because it rubs against the shoe.
Neither corns nor calluses are serious conditions."
976,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Corns %26 calluses ?,"Very closely check your feet if you have diabetes or numbness in the feet or toes. If you have diabetes and notice problems with your feet, contact your health care provider.
Otherwise, simply changing to better-fitting shoes or wearing gloves should resolve most problems with corns and calluses.
If you suspect that your corn or callus is infected or is not getting better despite treatment, contact your health care provider. Also call your health care provider if you have continued symptoms of pain, redness, warmth, or drainage."
977,What to expect if I have Corns %26 calluses  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Corns and calluses are rarely serious. If treated properly, they should improve without causing long-term problems."
978,What are the symptoms of Seborrheic dermatitis?,"Seborrheic dermatitis can occur on many different body areas. Usuallky it forms where the skin is oily or greasy. Commonly affected areas include the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, creases of the nose, lips, behind the ears, in the outer ear, and middle of the chest.
Seborrheic dermatitis in infants, also called cradle cap, is a harmless, temporary condition. It appears as thick, crusty, yellow or brown scales over the child's scalp. Similar scales may also be found on the eyelids, ear, around the nose, and in the groin. Cradle cap may be seen in newborns and small children up to age 3.
Cradle cap is not contagious, nor is it caused by poor hygiene. It is not an allergy, and it is not dangerous. Cradle cap may or may not itch. If it itches, excessive scratching of the area may cause additional inflammation, and breaks in skin may cause mild infections or bleeding.
In general, symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis include:
Skin lesions Plaques over large area Greasy, oily areas of skin Skin scales -- white and flaking, or yellowish, oily, and adherent -- ""dandruff"" Itching -- may become more itchy if infected Mild redness Hair loss"
979,What causes Seborrheic dermatitis?,Seborrheic dermatitis is thought to be due to a combination of an over production of skin oil and irritation from a yeast called malessizia.
980,Who is at highest risk for Cradle cap ?,"Seborrheic dermatitis appears to run in families. Stress, fatigue, weather extremes, oily skin, infrequent shampoos or skin cleaning, use of lotions that contain alcohol, skin disorders (such as acne), or obesity may increase the risk.
Neurologic conditions, including Parkinson's disease, head injury, and stroke may be associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has also been linked to increased cases of seborrheic dermatitis."
981,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cradle cap ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if seborrheic dermatitis symptoms do not respond to self-care or over-the-counter treatments.
Also call if patches of seborrheic dermatitis drain fluid or pus, form crusts, or become very red or painful."
982,What to expect if I have Cradle cap  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic (life-long) condition that can be controlled with treatment.

Note: People with a normal immune system may have no symptoms at all."
984,What causes Cryptococcosis?,"Cryptococcus neoformans, the fungus that causes this disease, is ordinarily found in soil. It enters and infects the body through the lungs. Once inhaled, infection with cryptococcosis may go away on its own, remain in the lungs only, or spread throughout the body (disseminate). Most cases are in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV infection, taking high doses of corticosteroid medications, cancer chemotherapy, or who have Hodgkin's disease. In people with a normal immune system, the lung (pulmonary) form of the infection may have no symptoms. In people with weakened immune systems, the cryptococcus organism may spread to the brain. Neurological (brain) symptoms begin gradually. Most people with this infection have meningoencephalitis (swelling and irritation of the brain and spinal cord) when they are diagnosed. Cryptococcus is one of the most common life-threatening fungal infections in people with AIDS."
985,Who is at highest risk for Cryptococcosis ?,People who have weakened immune system are at highest risk for developing the disease.
986,What to expect if I have Cryptococcosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Central nervous system involvement often causes death or leads to permanent damage.
987,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cryptococcosis ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of cryptococcosis, especially if you have a weakened immune system."
988,What are the symptoms of Cutaneous skin tags?,"The only symptom is a growth on the skin. The growth (tag) is usually small, although some may be up to a half-inch long.
Other characteristics include:
Located on the neck, armpits, trunk, body folds, or other areas May have a narrow stalk Usually skin-colored, occasionally darker"
989,What causes Cutaneous skin tags?,"Cutaneous tags are very common skin growths. They usually occur after midlife and are usually harmless and noncancerous (benign). The tag sticks out of the skin and may have a short, narrow stalk connecting it to the surface of the skin.
Cutaneous tags are usually painless and do not grow or change. However, they may be irritated from rubbing by clothing or other materials. They are thought to occur from skin rubbing against skin, so they commonly form in skin folds."
990,Who is at highest risk for Cutaneous skin tags ?,Cutaneous skin tags are more common in people who are overweight or who have diabetes.
991,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cutaneous skin tags ?,"Call your health care provider if you have cutaneous tags and you want them removed, or if the appearance of a cutaneous tag changes."
992,What to expect if I have Cutaneous skin tags  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cutaneous tags are generally benign and usually not bothersome. They may become irritated or be cosmetically displeasing. There is usually no regrowth or scar formation after cutaneous tags are removed, although new growths may appear elsewhere on the body."
993,What are the symptoms of Cysticercosis ?,"Most often, the worms stay in muscles and do not cause symptoms.
Symptoms that do occur depend on where the infection is found in the body
Brain: seizures or symptoms similar to those of a brain tumor Eyes: decreased vision or blindness Heart: abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure (rare) Spine: weakness or changes in walking due to damage to nerves in the spinal cord"
994,What are the causes of Cysticercosis ?,"Cysticercosis is caused by swallowing eggs from T. solium, which are found in contaminated food. Autoinfection is when a person is already infected with adult T. solium, then swallows eggs following improper hand washing after a bowel movement.
Risk factors include eating pork, fruits, and vegetables contaminated with T. solium as a result of unhealthy cooking or food preparation. The disease can also be spread by contact with infected feces.
The disease is rare in the United States, but is common in many developing countries."
995,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cysticercosis ?,"If you have any symptoms of cysticercosis, contact your health care provider."
996,What are the Symptoms of (Dermatofibroma)?,"Dermatofibromas are most often found on the arms and legs of women. They are small brown or reddish-brown mobile nodules, and they feel quite firm. They may be tender to touch. Many lesions demonstrate a ""dimple sign,"" where the central portion puckers as the lesion is compressed on the sides. They generally do not change in size."
997,What Causes (Dermatofibroma)?,The causes of dermatofibroma has not been identified.

If ringworm affects your hair, you will have bald patches.
If ringworm affects your nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble."
1008,What causes Dermatophytosis?,"Ringworm is common, especially among children. However, it may affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.
Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus called tinea grows and multiplies on your skin.
Ringworm can affect the skin on your:
Beard -- tinea barbae Body -- tinea corporis Feet -- tinea pedis (also called athlete's foot) Groin area -- tinea cruris (also called jock itch) Scalp -- tinea capitis
Ringworm can spread easily from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come into contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets that carry the fungus. Cats are common carriers.
The fungus that causes ringworm thrive in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails."
1009,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dermatophytosis ?,"Call your doctor right away if you have any signs of a bacterial infection, which can result from scratching. These signs include swelling, warm skin, sudden worsening in redness of the patches, red streaking, pus, drainage, and fever.
Call your doctor if:
You have ringworm on your scalp or beard Your skin does not improve after 4 weeks of self-care The rash spreads and you have diabetes or a weakened immune system due to disease or certain medications"
1010,What to expect if I have Dermatophytosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Skin medicine usually treats ringworm within 4 weeks. If your ringworm infection is severe or it does not respond well to self-care, it will usually respond quickly to antifungal pills."
1011,What are the symptoms of Diphtheria ?,"The incubation period is 2–5 days (range: 1–10 days). Affected anatomic sites include the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract (nose, pharynx, tonsils, larynx, and trachea respiratory diphtheria), skin (cutaneous diphtheria), or rarely, mucous membranes at other sites (eye, ear, vulva). Nasal diphtheria can be asymptomatic or mild, with a blood-tinged discharge. Respiratory diphtheria has a gradual onset and is characterized by a mild fever (rarely >101°F 38.3°C), sore throat, difficulty swallowing, malaise, loss of appetite, and if the larynx is involved, hoarseness. The hallmark of respiratory diphtheria is a pseudomembrane that appears within 2–3 days of illness over the mucous lining of the tonsils, pharynx, larynx, or nares and that can extend into the trachea. The pseudomembrane is firm, fleshy, grey, and adherent, and it will bleed after attempts to remove or dislodge it. Fatal airway obstruction can result if the pseudomembrane extends into the larynx or trachea, or if a piece of it becomes dislodged. In severe respiratory diphtheria, cervical lymphadenopathy and soft-tissue swelling in the neck give rise to a “bull-neck” appearance. Systemic complications, including myocarditis and polyneuropathies, can result from absorption of diphtheria toxin from the infection site. However, cutaneous and nasal diphtheria are localized and rarely associated with systemic toxicity. The case-fatality ratio of respiratory diphtheria is 5%–10%."
1012,What causes?,"Humans are the only known reservoir of C. diphtheriae. Person-to-person transmission occurs through oral or respiratory droplets, close physical contact, and rarely, by fomites. Cutaneous diphtheria is common in tropical countries, and contact with discharge from skin lesions may transmit infection in these environments."
1013,Who is at highest risk for Diphtheria ?,Children are at the highest risk of getting the disease.
1014,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diphtheria ?,If you think you are having symptoms of diptheria you should contact your doctor.
1015,What to expect if I have Diphtheria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The disease can be prevented by the widespread administration of vaccines. However, the prognosis is poor once the disease sets in."
1016,What causes Dry skin?,"Dry skin is common. It happens more often in the winter when cold air outside and heated air inside cause low humidity. Forced-air furnaces make skin even drier.
The skin loses moisture and may crack and peel, or become irritated and inflamed."
1017,Who is at highest risk for Dry skin ?,"Bathing too frequently, especially with harsh soaps, may contribute to dry skin. Eczema may cause dry skin."
1018,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dry skin ?,"Call your doctor if:
You feel itchy without a visible rash Dryness and itching are preventing you from sleeping You have any open cuts or sores from scratching Home care measures do not relieve your dryness and itching"
1019,What to expect if I have Dry skin  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Your doctor will perform a physical examination with careful attention to all parts of your skin.
To better understand the cause of the dry skin, your doctor may ask:
When did your dry skin develop or has it always been dry? Are all parts of your body affected? If not, what are the specific locations involved? What seems to make the dryness worse? Does anything make it feel better? What are your bathing habits? Do you have any other symptoms?"
1020,What are the symptoms of Dysplastic nevus?,"Usually, the first sign of dysplastic nevus is a change in the size, shape, color or feel of a mole. The ABCD rule can help you tell whether the mole is normal or not. Moles that have any of these signs should be checked by your doctor.
A symmetry: It means one half of the mole does not match the other half. B order irregularity: The edges of the mole looks ragged, blurred, or notched. C olor: The color over the mole is not the same and may be shades of tan, brown, or black, and sometimes patches of pink, red, blue, or white. D iameter: The mole is larger than about 1/4 inch, although sometimes dysplastic nevi can be smaller. The mole is growing or changing in shape or color
Some dysplastic nevi do not fit the ""rules"" above and may be hard to tell if the mole is normal or not. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
1021,Who is at highest risk for Dysplastic nevus ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of melanoma is related to several factors.
Sunlight (solar UV radiation): Too much exposure to sunlight(solar UV radiation) is thought to be the biggest risk factor for most dysplastic nevi. Moles: Although as a benign skin tumor, the mole increases the chance of getting dysplastic nevi, especially for people with many moles. Genetic factors: Epidemiological data show that Whites with fair skin, freckles, or red or blond hair have a higher risk of dysplastic nevi than other race. Immunosuppressive factors: Clinical surveys suggest patients treated with Immunosuppressive medicines such as transplant patients, have an increased risk of developing dysplastic nevus. Previous melanoma: A person with previous history of melanoma has a higher risk of getting another dysplastic nevus. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP): Patients with XP are at higher risk of dysplastic nevus because they can not repair damage caused by sunlight. Age: Epidemiological data suggest that dysplastic nevus can be found both in old people and in younger people. Gender: Men have a higher chance of developing dysplastic nevus than women."
1022,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dysplastic nevus ?,Call your dermatologist if symptoms of dysplastic nevus develops.
1023,What to expect if I have Dysplastic nevus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of melanoma depends on the following:
The location and size Whether there was bleeding or ulceration at the primary site The patient’s general health"
1024,What are the symptoms of Ecthyma?,"The main symptom of ecthyma is a small blister with a red border that may be filled with pus. The blister is similar to that seen in persons with impetigo, but the infection spreads much deeper into the skin.
After the blister goes away, a crusty ulcer appears."
1025,What causes Ecthyma?,"Ecthyma is most often caused by the bacteria streptococcus. Sometimes, staphylococcus bacteria causes this skin infection."
1026,Who is at highest risk for Ecthyma ?,The infection may start in skin that has been injured due to a scratch or insect bite. It often develops on the legs.
1027,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ecthyma ?,Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of ecthyma.
1028,What to expect if I have Ecthyma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Unlike impetigo, ecthyma can sometimes result in scarring."
1029,What are the symptoms of Ectodermal dysplasia?,"People with ectodermal dysplasia may not sweat or may have decreased sweating because of a lack of sweat glands.
Children with the disease may have difficulty controlling fevers. Mild illness can produce extremely high fevers, because the skin cannot sweat and control temperature properly.
Affected adults are unable to tolerate a warm environment and need special measures to keep a normal body temperature.
Other symptoms include:
Abnormal nails Abnormal or missing teeth Absent or decreased tears Decreased skin color (pigment) Heat intolerance Inability to sweat Large forehead Lower than normal number of teeth Low nasal bridge Poor hearing Poor temperature regulation Poor vision Thin, sparse hair Thin skin"
1030,What causes Ectodermal dysplasia?,There are many different types of ectodermal dysplasia.
1031,Who is at highest risk for Ectodermal dysplasia ?,Many gene defects can cause ectodermal dysplasias. The most common form of ectodermal dysplasia usually affects men. Other forms of the disease affect men and women equally.
1032,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ectodermal dysplasia ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if your child shows symptoms of this disorder.
1033,What to expect if I have Ectodermal dysplasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Having ectodermal dysplasia will not shorten your lifespan, but you must pay constant attention to temperature regulation and other problems associated with this condition."
1034,What is Eczema?,"Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is manifested as a skin swelling, flakiness, dryness of the skin, and itchy sensation. Several factors are linked with this disease such as genetic mutation, and family history. Eczema cannot be cured, but it is not contagious. This is usually associated with allergy."
1035,What are the symptoms of Eczema?,"Eczema can present as: severe itchiness Skin color changes Flakiness of the skin Small bumps Infants and children - lesions are found on the neck, head, cheeks, scalp, front of the arms and legs. Adolescents and adults - lesions are distributed mainly on elbow creases, lateral portion of the neck, and back of the knees."
1036,What are the symptoms of Ehrlichiosis?,"The time between the tick bite and when symptoms occur is about 7 - 9 days. This is called the incubation period.
Symptoms may seem like the flu (influenza), and may include:
Chills Fever Headache Muscle aches Nausea
Other possible symptoms:
Diarrhea Fine pinhead-sized areas of bleeding in the skin (petechial rash) Flat red rash (maculopapular rash) General ill feeling (malaise)
A rash appears in fewer than half of cases. Sometimes, the disease may be mistaken for Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The symptoms are often quite general, but patients are sometimes sick enough to see a doctor."
1037,What causes Ehrlichiosis?,"Ehrlichiosis is caused by bacteria that belong to the family called Rickettsiae. Rickettsial bacteria cause a number of serious diseases worldwide, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus. All of these diseases are spread to humans by a tick, flea, or mite bite.
Scientists first described ehrlichiosis in 1990, and have identified two types in the United States:
Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by the rickettsial bacteria called Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is also called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). It is caused by the rickettsial bacteria called Anaplasma phagocytophilum (once called Ehrlichia equi or Ehrlichia phagocytophila).
Ehrlichia bacteria can be carried by the Lone Star tick, the American dog tick, and the deer tick, which can also cause Lyme disease.
In the United States, HME is found mainly in the southern central states and the Southeast. HGE is found mainly in the Northeast and upper Midwest."
1038,Who is at highest risk for Ehrlichiosis ?,"Risk factors for ehrlichiosis include:
Living near an area with a lot of ticks Owning a pet that may bring a tick home Walking or playing in high grasses"

1041,What are the symptoms of Epidermolysis bullosa?,"Symptoms depend on the type of epidermolysis bullosa, but can include:
Alopecia (hair loss) Blisters aound the eyes and nose Blisters in or around the mouth and throat, causing feeding problems or swallowing difficulty Blisters on the skin as a result of minor injury or temperature change Blistering that is present at birth Dental problems such as tooth decay Hoarse cry, cough, or other breathing problems Milia (tiny white bumps or pimples) Nail loss or deformed nails"
1042,What causes Epidermolysis bullosa?,"There are four main types of epidermolysis bullosa:
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Epidermolysis bullosa simplex Hemidesmosomal epidermolysis bullosa Junctional epidermolysis bullosa
Another rare type of epidermolysis bullosa called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, is an autoimmune disorder. It may be difficult to tell this condition apart from another autoimmune skin disorder called mucous membrane pemphigoid.
Identifying the exact type of epidermolysis bullosa is complicated. Even within the main types listed above, there are many subtypes. For example, Weber-Cockayne is the most common form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. This type involves blistering of the palms and soles and may include excess sweating.
Epidermolysis bullosa can vary from minor blistering of the skin to a lethal form involving other organs. The condition generally starts at birth or soon after.
Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita usually appears in adults over age 50, although it can occur in children. It is linked to Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease) and possibly lupus. Adults with this type of epidermolysis bullosa may also have symptoms of these other conditions.
Mild cases of epidermolysis bullosa simplex may not be diagnosed until adulthood."
1043,Who is at highest risk for Epidermolysis bullosa ?,"All types of epidermolysis bullosa are usually inherited. Having a family history of the disease, and especially having a parent with it, is a risk factor."
1044,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Epidermolysis bullosa ?,"If your infant has any blistering shortly after birth, call your health care provider. If you have a family history of epidermolysis bullosa and plan to have children, you may want to have genetic counseling."
1045,What to expect if I have Epidermolysis bullosa  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on the severity of the illness. Mild forms of epidermolysis bullosa improve with age.
In the severe forms, scarring after blisters form may cause:
Contracture deformities (for example, at the fingers, elbows, and knees) and other deformities Feeding and swallowing difficulties if the mouth and esophagus are involved Fused fingers and toes Restricted mobility from scarring
Very serious forms of epidermolysis bullosa have a very high mortality rate.
Secondary infection is common."

A serious injury Blood vessel disease (such as arteriosclerosis, also called hardening of the arteries, in your arms or legs) Diabetes Suppressed immune system (for example, from HIV or chemotherapy) Surgery"
1096,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gangrene (Patient information)?,"Call your doctor immediately if:
A wound does not heal or there are frequent sores in an area An area of your skin turns blue or black There is foul-smelling discharge from any wound on your body You have persistent, unexplained pain in an area You have persistent, unexplained fever"
1097,What to expect if I have Gangrene (Patient information) (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"What to expect depends on where the gangrene is in the body, how much gangrene there is, and the person's overall condition. If treatment is delayed, the gangrene is extensive, or the person has other significant medical problems, they may die."
1098,What are the symptoms of Herpes simplex?,"Many people with HSV-2 infection never have sores, or they have very mild symptoms that they do not even notice or mistake for insect bites or another skin condition. If signs and symptoms do occur during the first outbreak, they can be quite severe. This first outbreak usually happens within 2 weeks of being infected.
Generalized or whole-body (systemic) symptoms may include:
Decreased appetite Fever General sick feeling (Malaise) Muscle aches in the lower back, buttocks, thighs, or knees
Genital symptoms include the appearance of small, painful blisters filled with clear or straw-colored fluid. They are usually found:
In women: on the outer vaginal lips (labia), vagina, cervix, around the anus, and on the thighs or buttocks In men: on the penis, scrotum, around the anus, on the thighs or buttocks In both sexes: on the tongue, mouth, eyes, gums, lips, fingers, and other parts of the body Before the blisters appear, the person may feel the skin tingling, burning, itching, or have pain at the site where the blisters will appear When the blisters break, they leave shallow ulcers that are very painful. These ulcers eventually crust over and slowly heal over 7 - 14 days or more
Other symptoms that may occur include:
Enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the groin during an outbreak Painful urination Women may have vaginal discharge or, occasionally, be unable to empty the bladder and require a urinary catheter
A second outbreak can appear weeks or months after the first. It is almost always less severe and shorter than the first outbreak. Over time, the number of outbreaks may decrease. Once a person is infected, however, the virus hides within nerve cells and remains in the body. The virus can remain ""asleep"" (dormant) for a long period of time (this is called latency). The infection can flare-up or reactivate at any time. Events that can trigger latent infection to become active and bring on an outbreak include:
Fatigue Genital irritation Menstruation Physical or emotional stress Trauma
Attacks can recur as seldom as once per year, or so often that the symptoms seem continuous. Recurrent infections in men are generally milder and shorter than those in women."
1099,What causes Herpes simplex?,"Genital herpes is caused by two viruses:
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) causes most cases of genital herpes. HSV-2 can be spread through secretions from the mouth or genitals.
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) most often causes herpes infections of the mouth and lips (commonly called cold sores or fever blisters). HSV-1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is spread from one person to another during sexual contact. You may be infected with herpes when your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has herpes.
Herpes is most likely to be transmitted by contact with the skin of an infected person who has visible sores, blisters, or a rash (an active outbreak), but you can also catch herpes from an infected person's skin when they have NO visible sores present (and the person may not even know that he or she is infected), or from an infected persons mouth (saliva) or vaginal fluids.
Because the virus can be spread even when there are no symptoms or sores present, a sexual partner who has been infected with herpes in the past but has no active herpes sores can still pass the infection on to others. Genital HSV-2 infections is more common in women (approximately 1 of every 4 women is infected) than it is in men (nearly 1 of every 8 men is infected)."
1100,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Genital herpes ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have any symptoms of genital herpes, or if you develop fever, headache, vomiting, or widespread symptoms during or after an outbreak of herpes. Also call if you are unable to urinate."
1101,What to expect if I have Genital herpes  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Once you are infected, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life. Some people never have another episode, and others have frequent outbreaks. In most outbreaks, there is no obvious trigger. Many people, however, find that attacks of genital herpes occur with the following conditions:
Fatigue General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions, such as operations, heart attacks, and pneumonia) Immunosuppression due to AIDS or medication such as chemotherapy or steroids Menstruation Physical or emotional stress Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity
In people with a normal immune system, genital herpes remains a localized and bothersome infection, but is rarely life-threatening."
1102,What are the symptoms of Genital wart?,"Genital warts can be raised or flat, and are usually flesh-colored. They may appear as cauliflower-like growths. Sometimes they are so small and flat that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. Common places to find genital warts:
Females most often have warts inside or around the vagina or anus, on the skin around these areas, or on the cervix. Males most often have warts on the penis, scrotum, groin area, or thighs, as well as inside or around the anus in those who have anal intercourse. Both males and females may have warts on the lips, mouth, tongue, palate, or throat (larynx)
Other symptoms are rare, but may include:
Increased dampness or moisture in the area of the growths Increased vaginal discharge Itching of the penis, scrotum, anal area, or vulva Vaginal bleeding, with or after sexual intercourse"
1103,What causes Genital wart?,"The virus that causes genital warts is called human papilloma virus (HPV). More than 70 different types of HPV exist.
Several types of HPV cause genital warts, which may be found on the penis, vulva, urethra, vagina, cervix, larynx, and around and in the anus. Other types of HPV cause common or flat warts on other parts of the skin, such as the hands. However, warts on the hands or other parts of the body do not cause genital warts.
HPV infection around the genitals is common, although most people have no symptoms. Even if you do NOT have symptoms, however, you must be treated to prevent complications and spreading the condition to others. In women, HPV can invade the walls of the vagina and cervix. These warts are flat and not easy to see without special procedures. Certain types of HPV can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix, cervical cancer, or anal cancer. These are called high-risk types of HPV. The following are important facts about how HPV and genital warts can be spread:
HPV infection is passed from one person to another through sexual contact involving the skin of the anus, mouth, or vagina, or the mucus membrane. It is possible for genital warts and HPV to spread, even when no warts can be seen. You may not see warts for at least 6 weeks to 6 months after becoming infected with HPV. It may also take longer, even years, so when you first notice genital warts, it does not mean that you or your partner has had sexual contact with someone outside of your relationship. Not everyone who has been exposed to the HPV virus and genital warts wil develop them.
The following factors put you at higher risk for getting genital warts, having them spread more quickly, having them return, or having other complications of HPV:
Having multiple sexual partners Not knowing whether someone you had sex with had STIs Becoming sexually active at an early age Using tobacco and alcohol Having stress and other viral infections (such as herpes) at the same time Being pregnant Having an immune system that does not work well, such as during cancer treatment or AIDS
If a child has genital warts, you should suspect sexual abuse as a possible cause."
1104,Who is at highest risk for Genital wart ?,People with history of unprotected sexual intercourse are at increased risks of genital wart.
1105,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Genital wart ?,"A current or past sexual partner has genital warts You have visible warts on your external genitals, itching, discharge, or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Keep in mind that genital warts may not appear for months to years after having sexual contact with an infected person. You think a young child might have genital warts Women should begin having Pap smears at age 21."
1106,What to expect if I have Genital wart  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most sexually active young women become infected with HPV. In many cases, HPV goes away on its own. Most men who become infected with HPV never develop any symptoms or problems from the infection. However, they can pass it on to current and sometimes future sexual partners. Even after you have been treated for genital warts, you may still infect others. Certain types of genital warts increase a woman's risk for cancer of the cervix and vulva. Possible Complications Some types of HPV have been found to cause cancer of the cervix and vulva. They are the main cause of cervical cancer. The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause penile or anal cancer. The warts may become numerous and quite large, requiring more extensive treatment and follow-up procedures. When to Contact a Medical Professional"
1107,What are the symptoms of Giant congenital nevus?,"A nevus will appear as dark-colored patch with any of the following:
Brown to bluish-black color Hair Regular or uneven borders Small satellite areas (maybe) Smooth, irregular, or wart-like skin surface
Nevi are commonly found on the upper or lower parts of the back or the abdomen. They may also be found on the:
Arms Legs Mouth Mucus membranes Palms or soles"
1108,What causes Giant congenital nevus?,"Bathing trunk nevi are thought to be caused by defects or problems that occur as a baby grows in the womb. However, in some families bathing trunk nevi may be inherited.
A bathing trunk nevus may occur with:
Growth of fatty tissue cells (lipomas) Neurofibromatosis Other nevi Spina bifida
Smaller congenital pigmented or melanocytic nevi are common in children and lead to fewer complications. Larger or giant nevi are fairly rare."
1109,Who is at highest risk for Giant congenital nevus ?,Giant congenital nevus occur in infants.
1110,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Giant congenital nevus ?,This condition is usually diagnosed at birth. Call for an appointment with your health care provider (or mention it during a well-baby exam) if your child has a large pigmented area anywhere on the skin.
1111,What to expect if I have Giant congenital nevus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Skin cancer (such as malignant melanoma and other types) may develop in up to 15% (1 out of 6) of people with larger or giant nevi, often in childhood. The risk is higher for larger or giant congenital nevi located on the back or abdomen."
1112,What are the Symptoms of Glomus tumor?,"Episodes of pain radiating away from the lesion, often out of proportion relative to the small size of the tumor.
Pain can be reproduced by placing in cold water."
1113,What Causes Glomus tumor?,Evidence regarding the causes of glomus tumor remain insufficient.
1114,Who is at highest risk for Glomus tumor patient information?,"Women area t higher risk of developing single glomus tumors while multiple glomus tumors are more commonly seen among males.
Glomus tumors that occur as a single lesion are usually more frequent in adults. On the other hand, glomus tumors with multiple lesions are more commonly seen around 15 years earlier than the single lesions."
1115,What to expect if I have Glomus tumor patient information (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis is generally excellent for single glomus tumors tumors treated with wide excision.
However, the prognosis is poor for malignant glomus tumors with widespread metastases."
1116,What are the symptoms of Hair loss?,"Hair loss usually develops gradually and may be patchy or all over (diffuse). You lose roughly 100 hairs from your head every day. The average scalp contains about 100,000 hairs."
1117,What causes Hair loss?,"A sudden physical or emotional stress may cause one-half to three-quarters of the hair throughout your scalp to shed (called Telogen effluvium). You will notice hair coming out in handfuls while you shampoo, comb, or run your hands through your hair. You may not notice this for weeks to months after the episode of stress. The hair shedding will decrease over 6 - 8 months.
Cause of this type of hair loss are:
Childbirth Crash diets, especially those that do not contain enough protein High fever or severe infection Major surgery, major illness, sudden blood loss A number of medications, including retinoids, birth control pills, beta-blockers, certain antidepressants, NSAIDs (including iburpofen) and calcium channel blockers Severe emotional stress
Other possible causes of hair loss, especially if it is in an unusual pattern, include:
Alopecia areata -- bald patches that develop on the scalp, beard, and, possibly, eyebrows. Eyelashes may fall out as well. Anemia Autoimmune conditions such as lupus Burns Certain infectious diseases such as syphilis Excessive shampooing and blow-drying Hormone changes Nervous habits such as continual hair pulling or scalp rubbing Radiation therapy Thyroid diseases Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp) Tumor of the ovary or adrenal glands"
1118,Who is at highest risk for Hair loss ?,"Some women ages 30 - 60 may notice a thinning of the hair that affects the entire scalp. The hair loss may be heavier at first, and then gradually slow or stop. There is no known cause for this type of hair loss.
Both men and women tend to lose hair thickness and amount as they age. Baldness is not usually caused by a disease. It is related to aging, heredity, and changes in the hormome, testosterone. Inherited or ""pattern baldness"" affects many more men than women. About one-half of men begin to bald by the time they are 30 years old, and most are either bald or have a balding pattern by age 60."
1119,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hair loss ?,"Call your doctor if:
You are losing hair in an unusual pattern You are losing hair rapidly or at an early age (for example, in your teens or twenties) You have any pain or itching with the hair loss The skin on your scalp under the involved area is red, scaly, or otherwise abnormal You have acne, facial hair, or an abnormal menstrual cycle You are a woman and have male pattern baldness You have bald spots on your beard or eyebrows You have been gaining weight or have muscle weakness, intolerance to cold temperatures, or fatigue"
1120,What to expect if I have Hair loss  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A careful medical history and examination of the hair and scalp are usually enough to diagnose the cause of your hair loss.
Your doctor will ask detailed questions such as:
Are you losing hair only from your scalp or from other parts of your body as well? Is there a pattern to the hair loss, like a receding hairline or thinning or bald areas on the crown, or is the hair loss throughout your head? Have you had a recent illness or high fever ? Do you dye your hair ? Do you blow dry your hair? How often? How often do you shampoo your hair? What kind of shampoo, hair spray, gel, or other product do you put on your hair? Have you been under unusual stress lately? Do you have nervous habits that include hair pulling or scalp rubbing? Do you have any other symptoms like itching, flaking, or redness of your scalp? What medications do you take, including over-the-counter drugs?
Tests that may be performed (but are rarely needed) include:
Blood tests to rule out disease Microscopic examination of a plucked hair Skin biopsy
Ringworm on the scalp may require the use of an oral drug, such as griseofulvin. Creams and lotions applied to the affected area may not get into the hair follicles to kill the fungus."
1121,What are the symptoms of Hand-foot-and-mouth disease?,"Fever Headache Loss of appetite Rash with very small blisters on hands, feet, and diaper area; may be tender or painful if pressed Sore throat Ulcers in the throat (including tonsils), mouth, and tongue"
1122,What causes Hand-foot-and-mouth disease?,"Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, a member of the enterovirus family.
The disease is not spread from pets, but it can be spread by person to person. You may catch it if you come into direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stools of an infected person. You are most contagious the first week you have the disease.
The time between infection and the development of symptoms is about 3 - 7 days."
1123,Who is at highest risk for Hand-foot-and-mouth disease ?,"The most important risk factor is age. The infection occurs most often in children under age 10, but can be seen in adolescents and occasionally adults. The outbreaks occur most often in the summer and early fall."
1124,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hand-foot-and-mouth disease ?,"Call your doctor if there are signs of complications, such as pain in neck or arms and legs. Emergency symptoms include convulsions.
You should also call if:
A high fever is not reduced by medication Signs of dehydration occur: Dry skin and mucus membranes Weight loss Irritability Lethargy Decreased or dark urine"
1125,What to expect if I have Hand-foot-and-mouth disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Generally, complete recovery occurs in 5 to 7 days."
1126,What are the symptoms of Henoch-Schönlein purpura?,"Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Bloody stools Joint pain Purple spots on the skin (purpura), usually over the buttocks, lower legs, and elbows Hives or angioedema Painful menstruation"
1127,What causes Henoch-Schönlein purpura?,"Henoch-Schonlein is caused by an abnormal response of the immune system. It is unclear why this occurs.
The syndrome is usually seen in children, but it may affect people of any age. It is more common in boys than in girls. Many people with Henoch-Schonlein purpura had an upper respiratory illness in the weeks before."
1128,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Henoch-Sch%C3%B6nlein purpura ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, particularly if they last for more than a few days You have low urine output after an episode of Henoch-Schonlein purpura"
1129,What to expect if I have Henoch-Sch%C3%B6nlein purpura  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The disease usually gets better on its own without treatment.
1130,What are the symptoms of Hepatitis C?,"The incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. When first infected with the hepatitis C virus many people may not feel ill. Approximately 70%–80% of people with acute hepatitis C do not have any symptoms. Others may find their urine becomes dark and their eyes and their skin may turn yellow (jaundice) or they may experience a minor ‘flu-like’ illness. Other symptoms of acute hepatitis C include:
Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Joint pain Jaundice (yellow color in the skin or eyes)
These symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, but this does not necessarily mean that the infection has also gone.
If you have hepatitis symptoms, or think you have been put at risk, you should consult your doctor. A blood test can determine if you have hepatitis C. When a person has the virus for more than six months the illness is called chronic hepatitis C.
Most people with chronic hepatitis C do not have any symptoms. However, if a person has been infected for many years, his or her liver may be damaged. In many cases, there are no symptoms of the disease until liver problems have developed. In persons without symptoms, hepatitis C is often detected during routine blood tests≠≠ to measure liver function and liver enzymes (protein produced by the liver) level. The symptoms of chronic hepatitis C may be:
Mild to severe lethargy (tiredness) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Soreness in the upper right part of the belly (under the ribs) Fever and flu -like symptoms Joint pain
In many cases people who have chronic hepatitis C may not feel ill.
Even if a person with hepatitis C has no symptoms, he or she can still spread the virus to others."
1131,What causes Hepatitis C?,"The hepatitis C virus is present in the blood of an infected person. If infected blood enters another person’s blood stream, that person may get the virus. People can get hepatitis C by:
Sharing drug-injecting equipment such as needles, syringes and spoons Tattooing and body piercing using equipment that has not been properly cleaned and sterilised Sharing toothbrushes, razor blades or other similar personal items that could have small amounts of blood on them One person’s blood coming into contact with open cuts on another person Needlestick injuries in the health care setting In some countries, HCV is transmitted via the transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products;
Mothers with hepatitis C may on rare occasions pass the virus to their babies during pregnancy, or at the time of birth. Breastfeeding is considered safe and only cracked or bleeding nipples may be a problem.
Sexual transmission rates of hepatitis C are very low, but the risk is increased with certain sexual practices or circumstances where there is the possibility of blood-to-blood contact (for example, sex during menstruation). The risk increases for those who have multiple sex partners, have a sexually transmitted disease, or are infected with HIV."
1132,Who is at highest risk for Hepatitis C ?,"Early diagnosis can prevent health problems that may result from infection, and prevent transmission of the virus.
Some countries recommend screening for people who may be at increased risk of infection.
People in increased risk for hepatitis C infection, include:
Current injection drug users (currently the most common way hepatitis C virus is spread in the United States) Past injection drug users, including those who injected only one time or many years ago Recipients of donated blood, blood products, and organs (once a common way of transmission but now rare in the United States since blood screening became available in 1992) People who received a blood product for clotting problems made before 1987 Hemodialysis patients or persons who spent many years on dialysis for kidney failure People who received body piercing or tattoos done with non-sterile instruments People with known exposures to the hepatitis C virus, such as healthcare workers HIV -infected persons Children born to mothers infected with the hepatitis C virus Having sexual contact with a person who is infected with the hepatitis C virus Sharing personal care items, such as razors or toothbrushes, that may have come in contact with the blood of an infected person"
1133,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hepatitis C ?,"Talk to your doctor about being tested for hepatitis C if any of the following are true:
You are a current or former injection drug user, even if you injected only one time or many years ago You were treated for a blood clotting problem before 1987 You received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992 You are on long-term hemodialysis treatment You have abnormal liver tests or liver disease You work in healthcare or public safety and were exposed to blood through a needlestick or other sharp object injury You are infected with HIV"
1134,What to expect if I have Hepatitis C  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Chronic hepatitis C is a serious disease that can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, or even death.
It is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States. Approximately 8,000–10,000 people die every year from hepatitis C related liver disease.
Of every 100 people infected with the hepatitis C virus, about:
75–85 people will develop chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Of those: 60–70 people will go on to develop chronic liver disease 5–20 people will go on to develop cirrhosis over a period of 20–30 years 1–5 people will die from cirrhosis or liver cancer
Some people who have hepatitis C choose to make changes to their lives, such as reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a well balanced diet that is low in fat and considering overall health maintenance.
You should also:
Consult your doctor who will monitor your condition and, if necessary, refer you to a specialist. Consider being immunized against other hepatitis viruses for which there are vaccines (ie hepatitis A and hepatitis B) Completely cover any cut or wound with a waterproof dressing
If you have hepatitis C you should not:
share injecting equipment donate blood or body organs share personal items such as toothbrushes or razors
Although there is no legal obligation to do so, you may wish to discuss your condition with your health care provider (doctor, dentist, naturopath) for optimal health care."
1135,What are the symptoms of Hepatitis D?,"Hepatitis D may make the symptoms of hepatitis B more severe. Symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain Dark urine Fatigue Jaundice Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting
Exams and Tests
Anti-delta agent antibody Liver biopsy Liver enzymes (blood test)"
1136,What causes Hepatitis D?,"Hepatitis D or delta hepatitis is caused by the hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a defective RNA virus. HDV requires the help of a virus like the hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its own replication. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is only found in people who carry the hepatitis B virus. HDV may make a recent (acute) hepatitis B infection or an existing long-term (chronic) hepatitis B liver disease worse. It can even cause symptoms in people who carry hepatitis B virus but who never had symptoms. Hepatitis D occurs in 5% of people who carry hepatitis B.
Risk factors include:
Using intravenous (IV) or injection drugs Being infected while pregnant (the mother can pass the virus to the baby) Carrying the hepatitis B virus Men having sexual intercourse with other men Receiving many blood transfusions
Transmission is similar to that of HBV:
Bloodborne and sexual Percutaneous (injecting drug use, haemophiliacs) Permucosal (sexual) Rare perinatal
HDV is transmitted percutaneously or sexually through contact with infected blood or blood products.
Blood is potentially infectious during all phases of active hepatitis D infection. Peak infectivity probably occurs just before the onset of acute disease."
1137,Who is at highest risk for Hepatitis D ?,"Risk factors include:
Chronic Hepatitis B Virus carriers are at risk for infection with HDV Using intravenous (IV) or injection drugs Being infected while pregnant (the mother can pass the virus to the baby) Carrying the hepatitis B virus Men having sexual intercourse with other men Receiving many blood transfusions People exposed to unscreened blood or blood products Haemophiliacs
Since HDV absolutely requires the support of hepatitis B virus for its own replication, inoculation with HDV in the absence of HBV will not cause hepatitis D. Alone, the viral genome indeed replicates in a helper-independent manner, but virus particles are not released
Individuals who are not infected with HBV, and have not been immunized against HBV, are at risk of infection with HBV with simultaneous or subsequent infection with HDV."
1138,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hepatitis D ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of hepatitis B.
1139,What to expect if I have Hepatitis D  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Persons with an acute HDV infection usually get better over 2 to 3 weeks.
Liver enzyme levels return to normal within 16 weeks.
About 10% of those who are infected may develop long-term (chronic) liver inflammation (hepatitis)."
1140,What are the symptoms of Hepatitis E ?,"The incubation period following exposure to the hepatitis E virus ranges from three to eight weeks, with a mean of 40 days.
The incidence of hepatitis E is highest in adults between the ages of 15 and 40. Though children often contract this infection as well, they less frequently become symptomatic.
Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include:
Fever Jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine and pale stools) Malaise Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Fever Hepatomegaly Other less common features include diarrhea, arthralgia, pruritus, and urticarial rash
Some patients have asymptomatic infection."
1141,What to expect if I have Hepatitis E  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Mortality rates are generally low, for Hepatitis E is a “self-limiting” disease, in that it usually goes away by itself and the patient recovers. In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) and death.
Fulminant hepatitis occurs more frequently during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at greater risk of obstetrical complications and mortality from hepatitis E, which can induce a mortality rate of 20% among pregnant women in their third trimester.
Cases of chronic hepatitis E infection have been reported in immunosuppressed people. Reactivation of hepatitis E infection has also been reported in immunocompromised people."
1142,What are the symptoms of Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia?,"Frequent nosebleeds in children GI bleeding, including loss of blood in the stool or dark black stools Port-wine stain Seizures or unexplained, small strokes (from bleeding into the brain) Shortness of breath Telangiectases on the tongue, lips, nasal mucosa, face, ears, fingertips, nails, whites of the eyes, and skin (they may bleed easily)"
1143,What causes Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia?,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited condition. It can affect males or females of any ethnic or racial group.
People with this condition can develop abnormal blood vessels called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in several areas of the body. If they are on the skin, they are called telangiectasias. The AVMs can also develop in other areas of the body, such as the brain, lungs, liver, or intestines.
The syndrome is genetic, which means it results from an abnormality in one of a few genes. Scientists have identified some of the genes involved. However, they do not know exactly how the gene defects lead to the abnormal blood vessels seen in persons with this syndrome."
1144,Who is at highest risk for Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ?,"This is a genetic disorder, so people at risk are those who have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia."
1145,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ?,Call your health care provider if your child has frequent nose bleeds or other signs of this disease.
1146,What to expect if I have Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with this syndrome can live a completely normal lifespan, depending on the parts of the body where the AVMs are located."
1147,What are the symptoms of Herpes zoster?,"The first symptom is usually one-sided pain, tingling, or burning. The pain and burning may be severe and is usually present before any rash appears. Red patches on the skin, followed by small blisters, form in most people.
The blisters break, forming small ulcers that begin to dry and form crusts. The crusts fall off in 2 to 3 weeks. Scarring is rare. The rash usually involves a narrow area from the spine around to the front of the belly area or chest. The rash may involve face, eyes, mouth, and ears.
Additional symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain Chills Difficulty moving some of the muscles in the face Drooping eyelid (ptosis) Fever and chills General ill-feeling Genital lesions Headache Hearing loss Joint pain Loss of eye motion Swollen glands (lymph nodes) Taste problems Vision problems"
1148,What causes Herpes zoster?,"After you get chickenpox, the virus remains inactive (becomes dormant) in certain nerves in the body. Shingles occurs after the virus becomes active again in these nerves years later. The reason the virus suddenly become active again is not clear. Often only one attack occurs."
1149,Who is at highest risk for Herpes zoster ?,"Shingles may develop in any age group, but you are more likely to develop the condition if:
You are older than 60 You had chickenpox before age 1 Your immune system is weakened by medications or disease
If an adult or child has direct contact with the shingles rash on someone and has not had chickenpox as a child or a chickenpox vaccine, they can develop chickenpox, rather than shingles."
1150,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Herpes zoster ?,"Herpes zoster usually clears in 2 to 3 weeks and rarely recurs. If the virus affects the nerves that control movement (the motor nerves), you may have temporary or permanent weakness or paralysis. Sometimes, the pain in the area where the shingles occurred may last from months to years."
1151,What to expect if I have Herpes zoster  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Herpes zoster usually clears in 2 to 3 weeks and rarely recurs. If the virus affects the nerves that control movement (the motor nerves), you may have temporary or permanent weakness or paralysis. Sometimes, the pain in the area where the shingles occurred may last from months to years. See: Postherpetic neuralgia"
1152,What are the symptoms of Histoplasmosis?,"Chills Cough that brings up blood, mucus, or pus Fever Shortness of breath Unintentional weight loss"
1153,What causes Histoplasmosis?,"Histoplasma capsulatum is a fungus found in the soil of the central and eastern United States (especially Mississippi and Ohio river valleys), eastern Canada, Mexico, Central America, and South America. The infection occurs when a person breathes in the reproducing parts of the fungus, called spores. Those who have a healthy immune system usually do not have symptoms, or only mild ones."
1154,Who is at highest risk for Histoplasmosis ?,"This ""acute"" infection does not last, but can leave a person with small scars (granulomas). These scars can be difficult to distinguish from tumors in the lung. However, the infection can cause severe illness right away, or redevelop years after the first exposure, if a person's immune system is weakened by:
Cancer Chemotherapy Immune-suppressing drugs HIV infection
Risk factors for chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis include:
Living in or traveling to central or eastern United States Exposure to soil or particles contaminated with droppings of chickens, bats, or blackbirds Pre-existing COPD Weakened immune system, such as in people who have AIDS"
1155,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Histoplasmosis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. Call your health care provider if your symptoms continue despite treatment, or if you have breathing difficulty or symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis."
1156,What to expect if I have Histoplasmosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The infection usually goes away with antifungal medication, but scarring inside the lung often remains. Histoplasmosis is unusual enough that if you develop it, your health care provider should check to find out whether another disease is weakening your immune system. Often, those who have had chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis must follow up with their doctor, who will check for signs of relapse. In rare cases, a pulmonary histoplasmosis infection can spread through the blood to other organs. This is called disseminated histoplasmosis. People who have a suppressed immune system and very young children are more likely to develop this condition. If this occurs, the prognosis is less favorable."
1157,What are the symptoms of Hives?,"Itching Swelling of the surface of the skin into red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges
The hives may get bigger, spread, and join together to form larger areas of flat, raised skin.
They can also change shape, disappear, and reappear within minutes or hours. A true hive comes and goes. When you press the center of one, it turns white. This is called blanching."
1158,What causes Hives?,"When you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into your bloodstream. This causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms. Hives are a common reaction, especially in people with other allergies such as hay fever.
When swelling or welts occur around the face, especially the lips and eyes, it is called angioedema. Swelling from angioedema can also occur around your hands, feet, and throat.
Many substances can trigger hives, including:
Animal dander (especially cats) Insect bites Medications Pollen Shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and other foods
Hives may also develop as a result of:
Emotional stress Extreme cold or sun exposure Excessive perspiration Illness (including lupus, other autoimmune diseases, and leukemia Infections such as mononucleosis"
1159,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hives ?,"Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have:
Fainting Shortness of breath Tightness in your throat Tongue or face swelling Wheezing
Call your health care provider if the hives are severe, uncomfortable, and do not respond to self-care measures."
1160,What to expect if I have Hives  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hives may be uncomfortable, but they generally are harmless and disappear on their own. In most cases, the exact cause of hives cannot be identified."
1161,What are the symptoms of Human papillomavirus?,"HPV may lead to a broad spectrum of diseases. If you are infected you may have no signs or symptoms of HPV infection or, you may have increased risk of developing cancer.
There are over 100 different kinds of HPV and not all of them cause health problems. Some types of HPV may cause problems such as genital warts, while others can cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, or anus. Most of these problems are caused by types 6, 11, 16 or 18. 
When cancer develops, it may affect men and women. According to the CDC, HPV may be involved in different types of cancer, with the following incidences: 
Cervical cancer: The most common HPV -associated cancer. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV. Vulvar cancer: About 50% are linked to HPV. Vaginal cancer: About 65% are linked to HPV. Penile cancer: About 35% are linked to HPV. Anal cancer: About 95% are linked to HPV. Oropharyngeal cancer: About 60% are linked to HPV."
1162,Who is at highest risk for Human papillomavirus ?,"Any person who has ever had sexual contact with another person may be infected with HPV. The virus may infect both men and women. Among other reasons, the population should be aware of this virus, since people may be infected with it, never developing any symptoms and therefore not knowing that they have higher risk of developing disease. The virus may remain in the individual without carrying out any manifestations for years. 
You are more likely to be infected by HPV, if you have:
Sex at an early age. Many sex partners. A sex partner who has had many partners."
1163,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Human papillomavirus ?,"Most people with HPV do not know they are infected and never develop symptoms or health problems from it. Medical care should be sought whenever some abnormality is noticed by the patient. Some people find out they have HPV when they get genital warts. Women may find out they have HPV when they get an abnormal Pap test result (during cervical cancer screening). Others may only find out once they have developed more serious problems from HPV, such as cancers. Therefore it is important to keep regular check-ups with your physician in order to detect abnormalities in their early stages, so that proper treatment may be started."
1164,What to expect if I have Human papillomavirus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Often HPV goes away by itself within two years and does not cause health problems. It is thought that the immune system fights off HPV naturally. It is only when certain types of HPV do not go away over years that it can cause cancer. It is not known why HPV infection resolves in most, but not all cases. Unfortunately, there is no way to know which people will develop cancer or other health problems.  Considering that HPV infection may be asymptomatic, some patients may carry the virus and not know that they are infected. Accordingly, the prognosis will depend on the course of the infection, whether it is asymptomatic or it evolves into a cellular abnormality that may lead to cancer. The prognosis will therefore depend on the condition resulting from the cellular abnormalities and how early this is diagnosed, since for instance, a cervical cancer may be cured if diagnosed and operated on early, while if it is only caught late in its course, it may have a fatal outcome."
1165,What are the symptoms of Hyperhidrosis?,The primary symptom of hyperhidrosis is wetness.
1166,What causes Hyperhidrosis?,"Sweating helps the body stay cool. In most cases, it is perfectly natural. People sweat more in warm temperatures, when they exercise, or in response to situations that make them nervous, angry, embarrassed, or afraid.
However, excessive sweating occurs without such triggers. Those with hyperhidrosis appear to have overactive sweat glands. The uncontrollable sweating can lead to significant discomfort, both physical and emotional.
When excessive sweating affects the hands, feet, and armpits, it's called primary or focal hyperhidrosis.
If the sweating occurs as a result of another medical condition, it is called secondary hyperhidrosis. The sweating may be all over the body, or it may be in one area. Conditions that cause second hyperhidrosis include:
Acromegaly Anxiety conditions Cancer Carcinoid syndrome Certain medications and substances of abuse Glucose control disorders Heart disease Hyperthyroidism Lung disease Menopause Parkinson’s disease Pheochromocytoma Spinal cord injury Stroke Tuberculosis or other infections"
1167,Who is at highest risk for Hyperhidrosis ?,"Primary hyperhidrosis affects 2 - 3% of the population, yet less than 40% of patients with this condition seek medical advice. In the majority of primary hyperhidrosis cases, no cause can be found. It seems to run in families."
1168,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperhidrosis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
Prolonged, excessive, and unexplained sweating Sweating with or followed by chest pain or pressure Sweating with weight loss Sweating that most often occurs during sleep Sweating with fever, weight loss, chest pain, shortness of breath, or a rapid, pounding heartbeat - these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying disease, such as hyperthyroidism"
1169,What to expect if I have Hyperhidrosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Aluminum Chloride: Initially a patient may need to use it three to seven times a week. After sweating becomes normal, the person may need to use it only once every one to three weeks. If skin irritation is a problem, a doctor may temporarily prescribe a steroid-based cream.
Botox: Swelling goes away in a few weeks. The effect of a single injection can last up to a few months. Some patients need additional injections.
Iontophoresis: Sweating may be reduced after six to 10 sessions. After that, the person may need treatment once every one to four weeks."
1170,What are the symptoms of Ichthyosis vulgaris?,"Dry skin, severe Scaly skin (scales) Possible skin thickening Mild itching of the skin
The dry, scaly skin is usually most severe over the legs but may also involve the arms, hands, and middle of the body. Persons with this condition may also have many fine lines over the palm of the hand."
1171,What causes Ichthyosis vulgaris?,"Ichthyosis vulgaris is one of the most common of the inherited skin disorders. It may begin in early childhood, before age 4. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order for you to inherit the disease.
The condition is often more noticeable in the winter. It may occur along with atopic dermatitis, keratosis pilaris (small bumps on the back of the arms), or other skin disorders."
1172,Who is at highest risk for Ichthyosis vulgaris ?,"Ichthyosis vulgaris is a genetic disorder, so anyone with a family history of the disorder is at risk."
1173,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ichthyosis vulgaris ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
Symptoms continue despite treatment Symptoms get worse Skin lesions spread New symptoms develop"
1174,What to expect if I have Ichthyosis vulgaris  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Ichthyosis vulgaris can be a nuisance, but it rarely affects your overall health. The condition usually disappears during adulthood, but may return years later."
1175,What are the symptoms of Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?,Abnormally heavy menstruation Bleeding into the skin causes a characteristic skin rash that looks like pinpoint red spots (petechial rash) Easy bruising Nosebleed or bleeding in the mouth
1176,What causes Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?,"ITP occurs when certain immune system cells produce antibodies against platelets. Platelets help your blood clot by clumping together to plug small holes in damaged blood vessels.
The antibodies attach to the platelets. The spleen destroys the platelets that carry the antibodies.
In children, the disease sometimes follows a viral infection. In adults, it is more often a chronic (long-term) disease and can occur after a viral infection, with use of certain drugs, during pregnancy, or as part of an immune disorder.
ITP affects women more frequently than men, and is more common in children than adults. The disease affects boys and girls equally."
1177,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if severe bleeding occurs, or if other new symptoms develop."
1178,What to expect if I have Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, the chance of remission (a symptom-free period) is good. Rarely, ITP may become a long-term condition in adults and reappear, even after a symptom-free period."
1179,What are the symptoms of Impetigo?,"A single or possibly many blisters filled with pus; easy to pop and -- when broken -- leave a reddish raw-looking base (in infants) Itching blister: Filled with yellow or honey-colored fluid Oozing and crusting over Rash -- may begin as a single spot, but if person scratches, it may spread to other areas Skin lesions on the face, lips, arms, or legs, that spread to other areas Swollen lymph nodes near the infection (lymphadenopathy)"
1180,What causes Impetigo?,"Impetigo is caused by streptococcus (strep) or staphylococcus (staph) bacteria. Methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA) is becoming a common cause. The skin normally has many types of bacteria on it, but intact skin is an effective barrier that keeps bacteria from entering and growing in the body. When there is a break in the skin, bacteria can enter the body and grow there, causing inflammation and infection. Breaks in the skin may occur with:
Animal bites Human bites Injury or trauma to the skin Insect bites
Impetigo may also occur on skin where there is no visible break. It is most common in children, particularly those in unhealthy living conditions. In adults, it may follow other skin disorders or a recent upper respiratory infection such as a cold or other virus. It is similar to cellulitis, but it only involves the top layers of the skin. Impetigo is contagious, meaning it can spread to others. You can catch this infection if the fluid that oozes from the blisters touches an open area on your skin."
1181,Who is at highest risk for Impetigo ?,"The skin normally has many types of bacteria on it, but intact skin is an effective barrier that keeps bacteria from entering and growing in the body. When there is a break in the skin, bacteria can enter the body and grow there, causing inflammation and infection. Breaks in the skin may occur with:
Animal bites Human bites Injury or trauma to the skin Insect bites"
1182,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Impetigo ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of impetigo
1183,What to expect if I have Impetigo  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The sores of impetigo heal slowly and seldom scar. The cure rate is extremely high, but the condition often comes back in young children."
1184,What are the symptoms of Incontinentia pigmenti?,"Infants with IP are born with streaky, blistering areas. When the areas heal, they turn into rough bumps. Eventually, these bumps go away, but leave behind darkened skin, called hyperpigmentation. After several years, the skin returns to normal. In some adults, there may be areas of lighter colored skin (hypopigmentation).
IP is associated with central nervous system problems, including:
Delayed development Loss of movement (paralysis) Mental retardation Muscle spasms Seizures
Persons with IP may also have abnormal teeth, hair loss, and visual problems."
1185,What causes Incontinentia pigmenti?,"Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is caused by a genetic defect. In most cases, there is a problem with one of the genes located on the X chromosome.
Most babies born with IP develop discolored skin within the first 2 weeks. The discolored skin occurs when a substance called melanin builds up under the skin. Melanin gives skin its color."
1186,Who is at highest risk for Incontinentia pigmenti ?,"The condition is most often seen in females. When it occurs in males, it can be deadly."
1187,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Incontinentia pigmenti ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have a family history of IP and are considering having children Your child has symptoms of this disorder"
1188,What to expect if I have Incontinentia pigmenti  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,How well a person does depends on the severity of central nervous system involvement and eye problems.
1189,What are the symptoms of Incontinentia pigmenti achromians?,"Crossed eyes (strabismus) Increased body hair (hirsutism) Scoliosis Seizures Streaked, whirled or mottled patchs of skin on the arms, legs, and middle of the body Varying degrees of retardation"
1190,What causes Incontinentia pigmenti achromians?,The cause is unknown.
1191,Who is at highest risk for Incontinentia pigmenti achromians ?,It is slightly more common in girls than in boys.
1192,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Incontinentia pigmenti achromians ?,Call your health care provider if your child exhibits an unusual pattern of the color of the skin.
1193,What to expect if I have Incontinentia pigmenti achromians  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"What happens depends on the type and severity of symptoms that develop. In most cases, the skin pigment eventually returns to normal."
1194,What are the symptoms of Insect bites and stings?,"The nonemergency symptoms vary according to the type of insect and the individual. Most people have localized pain, redness, swelling, or itching. You may also feel burning, numbness, or tingling."
1195,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Insect bites and stings ?,"Call 911 if the person is having a severe reaction:
Trouble breathing, wheezing, shortness of breath Swelling anywhere on the face or in the mouth Throat tightness or difficulty swallowing Feeling weak Turning blue"
1196,What causes Itch?,"There are many causes of itching, including:
Aging skin Atopic dermatitis Contact dermatitis (poison ivy or poison oak) Contact irritants (such as soaps, chemicals, or wool) Dry skin Hives Insect bites and stings Parasites such as pinworm, body lice, head lice, and pubic lice Pityriasis rosea Psoriasis Rashes (may or may not itch) Seborrheic dermatitis Sunburn Superficial skin infections such as folliculitis and impetigo
Generalized itching may be caused by:
Allergic reactions Childhood infections (such as chickenpox or measles) Hepatitis Iron deficiency anemia Kidney disease Liver disease with jaundice Pregnancy Reactions to medications and substances such as antibiotics (penicillin, sulfonamides), gold, griseofulvin, isoniazid, opiates, phenothiazines, or vitamin A"
1197,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Itch ?,"Call your doctor or nurse if you have itching and:
Other, unexplained symptoms Is severe Does not go away Cannot be easily explained
Most itching does not require medical evaluation. Look for an obvious cause of itching at home.
It is sometimes easy for a parent to find the cause of a child's itching. Looking closely at the skin will help you identify any bites, stings, rashes, dry skin, or irritation. Often the cause of itching is fairly obvious, such as a mosquito bite.
Have the itching checked out as soon as possible if it keeps returning and does not have an obvious cause, you have total body itching, or you have hives that keep returning. Unexplained itching may be a symptom of a disease that could be serious."
1198,What are the symptoms of Jock itch ?,"Itching in groin, thigh skin folds, or anus Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze -- The patches often have sharply-defined edges and are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center Abnormally dark or light skin"
1199,What causes Jock itch ?,"Jock itch occurs when a particular type of fungus grows and spreads in the groin area.
Jock itch can be triggered by friction from clothes and prolonged wetness in the groin area, such as from sweating.
Jock itch may be contagious. It can be passed from one person to the next by direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with unwashed clothing."
1200,Who is at highest risk for Jock itch ?,"Jock itch occurs mostly in adult men and adolescent boys. It can sometimes accompany athlete's foot and ringworm. The fungus that causes jock itch thrives in warm, moist areas."
1201,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Jock itch ?,"Call your doctor if jock itch does not respond to home care after 2 weeks, or you have other symptoms."
1202,What to expect if I have Jock itch  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Jock itch usually responds promptly to treatment. It is often less severe than other tinea infections, but may last a long time.
Jock itch usually stays around the creases in the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort.
Other causes of itching in the groin include:
Lichen simplex chronicus Eczema Pubic lice Chemical irritation"
1203,What are the symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma?,"Usual symptoms include skin and internal organs.
Lesions in skin: The lesions can develop anywhere on the body, but most often on the legs, nose, the feet. Typical lesions begin as flat or slightly raised pink or red spots. With the development of the disease, the color of the lesions may be change into blue, purple, or brown.
Lesions in mouth and throat: The disease may cause sore, ooze, bleed, or swallow and breath problems in mouth and throat.
Lesions in gastrointestinal tract: The sarcoma may cause bleeding, anemia, abdominal pain and discomfort, even bowel obstruction.
Lesions in lung: When Kaposi's sarcoma in lung, it can make coughing, bloody sputum, shortness of breath, and fever.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
1204,What causes Kaposi's sarcoma?,"Before the AIDS epidemic, Kaposi's sarcoma was seen mainly in elderly Italian and Jewish men, and rarely, in elderly women. Among this group, the tumors developed slowly. In AIDS patients, the cancer can develop quickly. The cancer may also involve the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.
In people with AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by an interaction between HIV, a weakened immune system, and the human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Kaposi's sarcoma has been linked to the spread of HIV and HHV-8 through sexual activity.
People who have kidney or other organ transplants are also at risk for Kaposi's sarcoma.
African Kaposi's sarcoma is fairly common in young adult males living near the equator. One form is also common in young African children."
1205,Who is at highest risk for Kaposi%27s sarcoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of Kaposi's sarcoma is related to several factors.
Infection with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV): Kaposi's sarcoma only develops in people who are infected with KSHV.
Immune deficiency: A defect in the immune system increases the chance to developing Kaposi's sarcoma, especially when people with AIDS.
Race: Epidemiological data show that people in Eastern European, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern descent have a higher rate of getting Kaposi's sarcoma.
Gender: Men are much more likely to get Kaposi's sarcoma than women in many places. But in Africa, men, women and children are all at risk of Kaposi's sarcoma
Sexual activity: Scientists have found faggotry are more likely to get Kaposi's sarcoma than Lesbian."
1206,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Kaposi%27s sarcoma ?,"Kaposi's sarcoma in internal organs is a tumor that cannot be found early. If symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma develop, go to see your doctor as soon as possible:
Severe gastrointestinal tract bleeding Severe breath prolem"
1207,What to expect if I have Kaposi%27s sarcoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of Kaposi's sarcoma depends on the following:
The type of Kaposi sarcoma Whether the cancer has spread Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred The patient's general health, especially the immune system."
1208,What are the symptoms of Keloids?,"A skin lesion that is:
Flesh-colored, red, or pink Located over the site of a wound or injury Lumpy (nodular) or ridged
The lesion may itch while it is forming and growing."
1209,What causes Keloids?,"Keloids occur from such skin injuries as:
Acne Burns Chickenpox Ear piercing Minor scratches Surgical cuts Traumatic wounds Vaccination sites"
1210,Who is at highest risk for Keloids ?,"They are more common in people ages 10 to 20, and in African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. Keloids often run in families. Keloidosis is a term used when many or repeated keloids occur."
1211,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Keloids ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop keloids and want to have them removed or reduced You develop new symptoms"
1212,What to expect if I have Keloids  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Keloids usually are not medically dangerous, but they may affect the appearance. In some cases, they may become smaller, flatter, and less noticeable over a period of several years. Exposure to the sun during the first year after the keloid forms will cause the keloid to tan darker than the skin around it. This dark color may be permanent. Removing the keloid may not be permanent. Surgical removal may cause a larger keloid scar."
1213,What are the symptoms of Keratosis pilaris?,"Fine, bumpy texture to skin over the outer upper arm and thigh or elsewhere Skin-colored bumps the size of a grain of sand Slight pinkness may be seen around some bumps"
1214,What causes Keratosis pilaris?,"Keratosis pilaris is harmless (benign), does not get worse over time, and often disappears with age.
In mild cases, small bumps, similar in appearance to ""goose bumps,"" are found on the backs of the upper arms. The texture is that of very coarse sandpaper.
Bumps may also appear on the buttocks and thighs. Less commonly, bumps appear on the face and may be mistaken for acne.
Individual bumps are small, skin-colored papules that form within hair openings (follicles). The condition is generally worse in winter and often clears in the summer."
1215,Who is at highest risk for Keratosis pilaris ?,"It is more common in patients who have very dry skin, or who have atopic dermatitis (eczema). It seems to run in families."
1216,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Keratosis pilaris ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider (or discuss the condition during a routine visit) if you suspect that you have keratosis pilaris and the condition does not respond to use of over-the-counter moisturizing lotions.
1217,What to expect if I have Keratosis pilaris  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Keratosis pilaris may fade slowly with age.
1218,What are the symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis?,"Histiocytosis X often affects the whole body. A disease that affects the whole body is called a systemic disorder.
Symptoms can vary between children and adults, although there can be some overlap. Tumors in weight-bearing bones, such as the legs or spine, may cause the bones to fracture without apparent reason.
Symptoms in children may include:
Abdominal pain Bone pain (possibly) Delayed puberty Dizziness Ear drainage that continues long-term Eyes that appear to stick out (protrude) more and more Irritability Failure to thrive Fever Frequent urination Headache Jaundice Limping Mental deterioration Rash (petechiae or purpura) Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp Seizures Short stature Swollen lymph glands Thirst Vomiting Weight loss
Note: Children over 5 years old often have only bone involvement.
Symptoms in adults may include:
Bone pain Chest pain Cough Fever General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) Increased amount of urine Rash Shortness of breath Thirst and increased drinking of fluids Weight loss"
1219,What causes Langerhans cell histiocytosis?,"Histiocytosis X has typically been thought of as a cancer-like condition. More recently researchers have begun to suspect that it is actually an autoimmune phenomenon, in which immune cells mistakenly attack the body, rather than fight infections. Extra immune cells may form tumors, which can affect various parts of the body including the bones, skull, and other areas.
Some forms of the disorder are genetic.
Histiocytosis X is thought to affect roughly 1 in 200,000 people each year. It is most often seen in children ages 1 to 15. The rate peaks among children ages 5 to10.
Pulmonary histiocytosis X is a specific type of this disorder that involves swelling of the small airways (bronchioles) and small blood vessels in the lungs. It is most common in adults. The inflammation leads to lung stiffening and damage. The cause is unknown. It most often affects those ages 30 to 40, usually cigarette smokers."
1220,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Langerhans cell histiocytosis ?,Call your health care provider if you or your child have symptoms of this disorder. Go to the emergency room if shortness of breath or chest pain develop.
1221,What to expect if I have Langerhans cell histiocytosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Histiocytosis X affects many organs and can lead to death.
About half of those with pulmonary histiocytosis see improvement, while others eventually have permanent loss of lung function.
In very young patients, the outlook depends on the specific histiocytosis and severity of the disease. Some children can live a normal life with minimal disease involvement, while others may have a poor outcome. Young children, especially infants, are more likely to have body-wide symptoms that lead to death."
1222,What are the symptoms of Leishmaniasis?,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects the skin and sometimes the mucus membranes. Symptoms may include:
Skin sores, which may become a skin ulcer that heals very slowly Ulcers and wearing away (erosion) in the mouth, tongue, gums, lips, nose, and inner nose Stuffy nose, runny nose, and nosebleeds Breathing difficulty Swallowing difficulty
Systemic visceral infection in children usually begins suddenly with vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and cough. Adults usually have a fever for 2 weeks to 2 months, along with symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and appetite loss. Weakness increases as the disease gets worse. Other symptoms of systemic visceral leishmaniasis may include:
Belly area (abdominal) discomfort Cough (children) Diarrhea (children) Fever that lasts for weeks; may come and go in cycles Night sweats Scaly, gray, dark, ashen skin Thinning hair Vomiting (children) Weight loss"
1223,What causes Leishmaniasis?,Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of the sandfly.
1224,Who is at highest risk for Leishmaniasis ?,"There are different forms of leishmaniasis.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects the skin and mucus membranes. Skin sores usually start at the site of the sandfly bite. They can last for months or years before healing on their own. In a few people, sores may develop on mucus membranes. Systemic, or visceral leishmaniasis affects the entire body. This form occurs 2 - 8 months after a person is bitten by the sandfly. Most people do not remember having a skin sore. This form can lead to deadly complications. The parasites damage the immune system by decreasing the numbers of disease-fighting cells. Cases of leishmaniasis have been reported on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. In the Americas, leishmaniasis can be found in Mexico and South America. Leishmaniasis has been reported in military personnel returning from the Persian Gulf."
1225,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Leishmaniasis ?,If you feel that you are developing symptoms of Leishmania as listed above call your health professional
1226,What to expect if I have Leishmaniasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cure rates are high with the proper medicine. Patients should get treated before damage to the immune system occurs. Cutaneous leishmaniasis may lead to disfigurement. Death is usually caused by complications (such as other infections), rather than from the disease itself. Death often occurs within 2 years."
1227,What are the symptoms of Leprosy?,"The bacteria responsible for leprosy grow very slowly, sometimes taking 2 to 10 years before signs and symptoms appear. The symptoms tend to affect mainly to the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes (the soft, moist areas just inside the body's openings).
When loss of sensation occurs, injuries (such as burns or fractures) may go unnoticed. You should always try to avoid injuries. However, if you experience loss of sensation due to leprosy (or another cause), you may not feel pain, which commonly warns you of harm to your body. So, extra caution is required to ensure your body is not injured. 
The disease may cause symptoms, such as: 
Skin lesions that may be faded/discolored, than your normal skin tone. These lesions commonly have decreased sensation to touch, heat, or pain and do not heal after several weeks to months. Growths on the skin. Thick, stiff or dry skin. Severe pain. Numbness on affected areas of the skin. Muscle weakness or paralysis (especially in the hands and feet). Eye problems that may lead to blindness. Enlarged nerves (especially those around the elbow and knee). Stuffy nose. Nosebleeds. Ulcers on the soles of feet. Since leprosy affects the nerves, loss of feeling or sensation can occur."
1228,What causes Leprosy?,"Leprosy is caused by the organism Mycobacterium leprae. It is not very contagious (difficult to transmit) and has a long incubation period (time before symptoms appear), which makes it difficult to determine where or when the disease was contracted. Children are more susceptible than adults to contracting the disease.
Leprosy has two common forms, tuberculoid and lepromatous, and these have been further subdivided. Despite this classification, both forms produce sores on the skin, but the lepromatous form is most severe, producing large, disfiguring lumps and bumps (nodules). Also, forms of the disease eventually cause nerve damage in the arms and legs, which causes sensory loss in the skin and muscle weakness. People with long-term leprosy may lose the use of their hands or feet due to repeated injury resulting from lack of sensation.
The disease is common in many countries worldwide, and in temperate, tropical, and subtropical climates. Approximately 100 cases per year are diagnosed in the United States. Most cases are limited to the South, California, Hawaii, and U.S. island possessions. Today effective medications are available, and isolation of victims in ""leper colonies"" is unnecessary. The emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium leprae, as well as increased numbers of cases worldwide, has led to global concern about this disease.
Evidence suggests that the bacteria that cause leprosy are able to spread from person to person. The transmission might happen when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes. This leads to the release of droplets into the air that carry the bacteria to another person. It might also happen if you are exposed to other nasal fluids (also known as secretions). Droplets and other body secretions can contain the bacteria that cause leprosy, thereby transmitting the infection."
1229,Who is at highest risk for Leprosy ?,"Children are more susceptible than adults to contracting the disease.
People who live in countries where the disease is widespread are at higher risk of contracting he disease. These countries include:
Angola Brazil Central African Republic Democratic Republic of Congo Federated States of Micronesia India Kiribati Madagascar Mozambique Nepal Republic of Marshall Islands United Republic of Tanzania
People who have been in close contact with someone who has untreated Hansen’s disease are also at higher risk of contracting the disease, since they may have been exposed to the leprosy bacteria. However, as soon as patients start treatment, they are no longer able to spread the disease.
Yet, according to the CDC, most adults around the world might face very little risk of contracting leprosy, since evidence shows that 95% of all adults are naturally unable to get the disease, even if they’ve been exposed to the bacteria that causes it. 
In the southern areas of the United States some armadillos are infected with leprosy. Despite the low risk of contracting the disease from contact with an armadillo, it is possible. In case of contact with an armadillo, if you decide to see a doctor, make sure to provide a complete history of armadillo contact. Your doctor can determine whether or not you have the disease. In the unlikely event that you get leprosy, your doctor can also help you get treatment.
Therefore, whenever possible, avoid contact with armadillos, in order to further decrease the risk of contracting the disease."
1230,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Leprosy ?,"Although cases of leprosy in the United States are rare, you should contact your health care provider in case you feel you are developing symptoms of leprosy, in particular if you have had recent contact with someone who has the disease. Cases of leprosy in the United States need to be reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
1231,What to expect if I have Leprosy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Early recognition is important. Early treatment limits damage by the disease, renders the person noninfectious (you can not get the disease from them), and allows for a normal lifestyle."
1232,What are the symptoms of Lichen planus?,"Mouth lesions:
Tender or painful (mild cases may have no discomfort) Located on the sides of the tongue or the inside of the cheek Sometimes located on the gums Area of blue-white spots or ""pimples"" Lines of lesions that form a lacy-looking network Gradual increase in size of the affected area Lesions sometimes form painful ulcers
Skin lesions:

1237,What are the symptoms of Lichen simplex chronicus?,"This skin disorder leads to a scratch-itch cycle:
It may begin with something that rubs, irritates, or scratches the skin, such as clothing. This causes the person to rub or scratch the affected area. Constant scratching causes the skin to thicken. The thickened skin itches, causing more scratching, which causes more thickening. The skin may become leathery and brownish in the affected area.
Symptoms include:
Itching of the skin
May be long-term (chronic) May be intense Increases with nervous tension, stress
Skin lesion, patch, or plaque
Commonly located on the ankle, wrist, neck, rectum/anal area, forearms, thighs, lower leg, back of the knee, inner elbow Exaggerated skin lines over the lesion Distinct borders to the lesion Becomes leathery in texture (lichenification) Darkened (hyperpigmented) or reddened skin Raw areas Scratch marks Scaling"

1250,What to expect if I have Lymphadenopathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prompt treatment with antibiotics usually leads to a complete recovery. However, it may take weeks, or even months, for swelling to disappear. The amount of time to recovery depends on the cause. Prognosis is poor for malignant tumors."
1251,What are the symptoms of McCune-Albright syndrome?,"The hallmark symptom of McCune-Albright syndrome is premature puberty in girls. Menstrual periods may begin in early childhood, long before the breasts or pubic hair develop (which normally occur first). Puberty and menstrual bleeding may begin as early as 4 - 6 months in girls.

Bone fractures Deformities of the bones in the face Gigantism Irregular, large patchy café-au-lait spots, especially on the back"
1252,What causes McCune-Albright syndrome?,"McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by mutations in the GNAS1 gene. The abnormal gene is present in a fraction, but not all, of the patient's cells (mosaicism)."
1253,Who is at highest risk for McCune-Albright syndrome ?,This disease is not inherited. It is caused by a new change (mutation) to the DNA that occurs in the womb while the baby is developing. This mutation is not passed on to any of the person's children.
1254,When to seek urgent medical care when I have McCune-Albright syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if your child starts puberty early, or has other symptoms of McCune-Albright syndrome. Genetic counseling, and possibly genetic testing, may be recommended if the disease is diagnosed."

1256,What are the symptoms of Measles?,"Common Symptoms
Fever Rash Cough Runny Nose Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
Serious Symptoms/Complications
Diarrhea Ear infections Pneumonia Encephalitis Seizures Death
Approximately 20% of reported measles cases experience one or more complications. These complications are more common among children under 5 years of age and adults over 20 years old. Measles causes ear infections in nearly one out of every 10 children who get it. As many as one out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, and about one child in every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis. (This is an inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave your child deaf or mentally retarded.) For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage, give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby. In developing countries, where malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency are prevalent, measles has been known to kill as many as one out of four people. It is the leading cause of blindness among African children. Measles kills almost 1 million children in the world each year."
1257,What causes Measles?,Measles is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily from person to person. The main symptom of measles is an itchy skin rash. The rash often starts on the head and moves down the body. The virus normally grows in the cells that line the back of the throat and in the cells that line the lungs.
1258,Who is at highest risk for Measles ?,"Measles is spread by contact with an infected person, through coughing and sneezing (highly contagious). The disease is highly contagious, and can be transmitted from 4 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the onset. If one person has it, 90% of their susceptible close contacts will also become infected with the measles virus. The virus resides in the mucus in the nose and throat of the infected person. When that person sneezes or coughs, droplets spray into the air. The infected mucus can land in other people’s noses or throats when they breathe or put their fingers in their mouth or nose after handling an infected surface. The virus remains active and contagious on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. Measles spreads so easily that anyone who is not immunized will probably get it, eventually."
1259,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Measles ?,You should seek immediate medical attention at the first sign of symptoms that resemble Measles or if you have been exposed to someone who has the Measles virus and may be contagious. This is especially important for young children or anyone who may have a compromised immune system due to medication or illness.
1260,What to expect if I have Measles  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Measles itself is unpleasant, but the complications are dangerous. Six to 20 percent of the people who get the disease will get an ear infection, diarrhea, or even pneumonia. One out of 1000 people with measles will develop inflammation of the brain, and about one out of 1000 will die."
1261,What are the symptoms of Melanoma?,"Usually, the first sign of melanoma is a change in the size, shape, color, or feel of a mole. The ABCD rule can help you tell whether the mole is normal or not. Moles that have any of these signs should be checked by your doctor:
A symmetry: When one half of the mole does not match the other half.
B order irregularity: The edges of the mole look ragged, blurred, or notched.
C olor: The color over the mole is not the same and may have shades of tan, brown, or black, and sometimes patches of pink, red, blue, or white.
D iameter: The mole is larger than about 1/4 inch, although sometimes melanomas can be smaller.
E volution over time: The mole is growing or changing in shape or color.
Some melanomas do not fit the above mentioned ""rules"" and may be hard to tell if the mole is normal or not. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should seek medical care as early as possible."
1262,Who is at highest risk for Melanoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of melanoma is related to several factors.
Sunlight (solar UV radiation): Too much exposure to sunlight (solar UV radiation) is thought to be the biggest risk factor for most melanomas.
Moles: Although as a benign skin tumor, the mole increases the chance of developing melanoma, especially for people with multiple moles.
Genetic factors: Epidemiological data show that Whites with fair skin, freckles, or red/blonde hair have a higher risk of melanoma than the other races.
Immunosuppressive factors: Clinical surveys suggest that patients treated with Immunosuppressive medication, such as transplant patients, have an increased risk of developing melanoma.
Previous melanoma: A person with previous history of melanoma has a higher risk of developing melanoma.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP): Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) are at a higher risk of developing melanoma because they can not repair cell damage caused by sunlight.
Age: Epidemiological data suggest that melanoma can affect both the old and younger population.
Gender: Men have a higher chance of developing melanoma than women."
1263,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Melanoma ?,Call your dermatologist if symptoms of melanoma develop.
1264,What to expect if I have Melanoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of melanoma depends on the following:
The stage of melanoma: Whether the cancer is found in the outer layer of skin only, or has spread to the lymph nodes, distant locations in the body
The location and size of the tumor
Presence of bleeding or ulceration at the site of the melanoma
The patient’s general health"
1265,What are the symptoms of Melasma?,"Melasma doesn't cause any other symptoms besides skin discoloration but may be of great cosmetic concern.
A uniform brown color is usually seen over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. It is most often symmetrical (matching on both sides of the face)."
1266,What causes Melasma?,Melasma is a very common skin disorder.
1267,Who is at highest risk for Melasma ?,"Though it can affect anyone, young women with brownish skin tones are at greatest risk.
Melasma is often associated with the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. It is especially common in pregnant women, women who are taking birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause.
Sun exposure is also a strong risk factor for melasma. The condition is particularly common in tropical climates"
1268,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Melasma ?,Call your health care provider if you have persistent darkening of your face.
1269,What to expect if I have Melasma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Melasma often fades over several months after stopping birth control pills or HRT, or after delivering a child. It may return with additional pregnancies or use of these medications."
1270,What are the symptoms of Meningococcemia?,"There may be few symptoms at first. Some may include:
Anxiety Fever Headache Irritability Muscle pain Nausea Rash with red or purple spots (petechiae)
Later symptoms may include:
Changing level of consciousness Large areas of bleeding under the skin (purpura) Shock"
1271,What causes Meningococcemia?,"Meningococcemia is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. The bacteria frequently lives in a person's upper respiratory tract without causing visible signs of illness. The bacteria can be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets -- for example, you may become infected if you are around someone with the condition when they sneeze or cough. Family members and those closely exposed to someone with the condition are at increased risk. The infection occurs more frequently in winter and early spring."

1280,What are the symptoms of Microsporidiosis?,"Microsporidiosis usually affects people with depressed immunity especially people with HIV. Microsporidia can affect many systems such as gastrointestinal tract, eyes, respiratory tract and urinary tract. Intestinal microsporidiosis is the most common form of the disease. It usually causes chronic diarrhea which might be complicated with weight loss, and vitamin deficiency. Microsporidiosis might also affect the lungs causing cough, fever and difficult breathing. Ocular microsporidiosis presents with red painful eye and decreased vision acuity. Microsporidia can spread throughout the body causing disease in the brain, urinary system, gall bladder and blood."
1281,What causes Microsporidiosis?,"Microsporidiosis is caused by an organism called microsporidia. Microsporidia are unicellular organisms and are obligatory intracellular meaning that it has to live inside the cell of the host to survive and multiply. The exact method of transmission of microsporidia is not fully understood, but it is thought to be transmitted through inhalation or ingestion of the spores (which are the infective form of the disease). When the organism lands inside the cell, it multiplies and eventually ruptures causing the release of spores."
1282,Who is at highest risk for Microsporidiosis ?,People with suppressed immunity such as HIV patients and cancer patients are the most at risk individuals to have microsporidiosis.
1283,What to expect if I have Microsporidiosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In healthy individuals, the prognosis is good and the disease is self-limiting. In immunocompromised individuals, the disease is more dangerous and can be fatal.

1284,Why is the cure rate so varied?,"These are topics for discussion, but errors introduced in the technique can introduce false negative errors. There are numerous reasons why the cure rate is not 100%. Some of Dr. Mohs data revealed a cure rate as low as 96%, but these were often very large tumor, and previously been treated by other modalities. Some authors claim that their 5 year cure rate for primary basal cell cancer exceeded 99% while other noted more conservative cure rate of 97%. The quoted cure rate for Mohs surgery on previously treated basal cell cancer is about 94%. 
1. Modern frozen section method. Frozen section histology does not give the added margin of safety by the cytotoxic Mohs paste,  originally used by Dr. Mohs. This paste might have destroyed any residual cancer cells not detected by the pathologist.
2. Missing epidermal margins. Ideally, the Mohs section should include 100% of the epidermal margin, but greater than 95% is often accepted.  Unfortunately, vigorous scrubbing, poorly controlled initial curettage, poor tissue health, technician's error, and surgeon's error can introduce areas missing epithelial margin. Some surgeon consider 70% epithelial margin acceptable, while other suggests 100% margin. In the ideal situation, 100% of the epithelial margin should be available to be reviewed on serial sectioning of the Mohs specimen.
3. Misreading of the pathology slide. It is difficult to differentiate between a small island of basal cell carcinoma and a hair follicle structure. Many Mohs surgeon limits their tissue processing to include only 2 sections of tissue.  This severely hampers their ability to determine if a structure is a hair follicle or a carcinoma. Two histologic sections can not fully distinguish these two nearly identical structures,  and can lead to either ""false negative"" or ""false positive"" errors by either calling a section clear of tumor, or calling a section positive for tumor, respectively. Serial sectioning of the tumor is preferred by other surgeons.  Surgeons who performs serial sectioning through the block of tissue (usually 100 micrometres apart) are assured the contiguous nature of his tumor, the distance of the tumor from the surgical margin, and is familiarized with the nature of the tumor. Serial sectioning also makes it easier to work with three dimensional tumor with difficult to compress margins.
4. Compression artifact, freezing artifact, cautery artifact, tissue folds, crush artifact from forceps, relaxing incision artifact, cartilage dropping out, fat compression, poor staining, dropping of tumor, etc.  These can be introduced as the tumor is ""flattened"". Stain can run from the surgical edge, and stain the surgical margin - giving a false impression that the entire surgical margin is clear, when it is not. While some surgeon unfamiliar with the ""whole piece"" or ""PacMan""  methods of processing might suggest that multiple piece sectioning is better than one. The more tissue sections are cut, the more artifacts in staining and tissue malformation will be introduced. It is imperative for the surgeon to be fully familiar with tissue handling and processing; and not simply relying on a trained technologist to perform his sectioning.
5. Hard to see tumor in heavy inflammatory infiltrate.  This can occur with squamous cell carcinoma, especially when complicated with local infection, or intrinsic lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Because of abnormal peripheral blood profile, response to inflammatory skin conditions with patients with myelomonocytic leukemia can have appearance of atypical cells at sites of inflammation, confusing the Mohs surgeon. 
6. Perineural spread, and benign changes simulating perineural spread. Tumor spreading along a nerve can be difficult to visualize, and sometime benign plasma cells can surround the nerve, simulating cancer. 
7. Difficult to cut and process anatomical area.  Examples would be the ear, and other three dimensional structures like eyelids. The ability to make a scallop shaped incision is increasingly difficult when the surgical surface is no longer a flat plane, but is a three dimensional rigid structure.
8. Recurrent skin cancer with multiple islands of recurrence. This can occur with either previous excision, or after electrodessication and curettage. As these residual skin cancer are often bound in scar tissue, and present in multiple location in the scar of the previous surgical defect - they are no longer contiguous in nature. Some surgeons advocate the removal of the complete scar in the treatment of ""recurrent"" skin cancers. Others advocate removing only the island of local recurrence, and leaving the previous surgical scar behind. The decision is often made depending on the location of the tumor, and the goal of the patient and physician.
9. Unreported or underreported recurrence. Many patients simply will not return to the original surgeon to report a recurrence. Consulting surgeon on the repeat surgery will often not inform the first surgeon of the recurrence. The time it takes for a recurrent tumor to be visible to the patient might be 5 or more years. Quoted ""cure"" rates must be looked upon with the understanding that a 5 year cure rate might not necessary be correct. As basal cell carcinoma is a very slowly progressing tumor, a 5 year no recurrence rate might not be adequate. Longer follow up might be needed to detect a slow growing tumor left in the surgical scar.
10. Poor training of the surgeon/pathologist/histotechnologist. While Mohs surgery is essentially a technical method of tissue handling and processing, the skill and training of the surgeon can greatly affect the outcome. The house of card is built with a foundation of good tissue handling, good surgical skill and hemostasis, and the bricks are the tissue processing and staining technique. A surgeon without a good histotechnologist is a house built with straw, and a histotechnologist without a good surgeon can not produce quality slides. While originally, surgeons learned the procedure by spending a few hours to several months with Dr. Mohs;  today, surgeons complete residency and fellowship spending hundreds of hours observing and doing Mohs surgery. It is highly encouraged that a physician interested in learning Mohs surgery should spend extended time observing, cutting, processing, and staining Mohs specimens. The histology block should be correctly mounted and cut the first time, as there is no second chances in Mohs histology. It is not a procedure that can be taught or learn in one weekend. Many residency and Mohs fellowship continue to teach the processing of only 2 Mohs sections per tumor. 
Irrespective of the problems associated with Mohs surgery, a true cure rate approaching 100% can occur with primary basal cell carcinoma (previously untreated) if proper respect of the physician's limitation, the procedure's limitation, and his laboratory staff's limitation. Conservative approach such as serial sectioning, good staining technique, and conservative Mohs margin (example: tumor at least 200 micrometre from the surgical margin) can assure the lowest recurrence rate."
1285,What are the symptoms of Molluscum contagiosum?,"Typically, the lesion of molluscum begins as a small, painless papule that may become raised up to a pearly, flesh-colored nodule. The papule often has a dimple in the center. These papules may occur in lines, where the person has scratched. Scratching or other irritation causes the virus to spread in a line or in groups, called crops. The papules are about 2 - 5 millimeters wide. There is usually no inflammation and subsequently no redness unless you have been digging or scratching at the lesions. The skin lesion commonly has a central core or plug of white, cheesy or waxy material. In adults, the lesions are commonly seen on the genitals, abdomen, and inner thigh."
1286,What causes Molluscum contagiosum?,"Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus that is a member of the poxvirus family. You can get the infection in a number of different ways. This is a common infection in children and occurs when a child comes into direct contact with a lesion. It is frequently seen on the face, neck, armpit, arms, and hands but may occur anywhere on the body except the palms and soles. Early lesions on the genitalia may be mistaken for herpes or warts but, unlike herpes, these lesions are painless."
1287,Who is at highest risk for Molluscum contagiosum ?,"This is a common infection in children and occurs when a child comes into direct contact with a lesion. The virus can spread through contact with contaminated objects, such as towels, clothing, or toys. The virus also spreads by sexual contact. Persons with a weakened immune system (due to conditions such as AIDS) may have a rapidly worse case of molluscum contagiosum."
1288,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Molluscum contagiosum ?,Schedule an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms suggestive of molluscum contagiosum and if lesions persist or spread along with new symptoms.
1289,What to expect if I have Molluscum contagiosum  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Molluscum contagiosum lesions may persist from a few months to a few years. These lesions ultimately disappear without scarring, unless there is excessive scratching, which may leave marks. Individual lesions usually disappear within about 2 - 3 months. Complete disappearance of all lesions generally occurs within about 6 - 18 months. The disorder may persist in immunosuppressed people."

Abdominal pain Vomiting blood
Symptoms of kidney (renal) mucormycosis include:
Fever Flank (side) pain
Symptoms of skin (cutaneous) mucormycosis include a single, painful, hardened area of skin that may have a blackened center."
1291,What causes Mucormycosis?,"Mucormycosis is caused by common fungi frequently found in the soil and in decaying vegetation. Most individuals are exposed to these fungi on a daily basis, but people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to infection.
Syndromes associated with mucormycosis include:
Rhinocerebral infection (infection of sinuses and brain) May start as a sinus infection May progress to involve inflammation of cranial nerves May cause blood clots that block vessels to the brain (thrombosis)
Pulmonary mucormycosis (lung involvement) -- pneumonia that gets worse quickly and may spread to the chest cavity, heart, and brain Mucormycosis of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and kidneys"
1292,Who is at highest risk for Mucormycosis ?,"Conditions most commonly associated with mucormycosis include diabetes (usually poorly controlled diabetes), chronic steroid use, metabolic acidosis, organ transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma, treatment with deferoxamine, and AIDS."

1296,What causes Mumps?,"The mumps are caused by a virus. The virus is spread from person-to-person by respiratory droplets (for example, when you sneeze) or by direct contact with items that have been contaminated with infected saliva.
Mumps most commonly occurs in children ages 2 - 12 who have not been vaccinated against the disease. However, the infection can occur at any age.
The time between being exposed to the virus and getting sick (incubation period) is usually 12 - 24 days.
Mumps may also infect the:
Central nervous system Pancreas Testes"
1297,Who is at highest risk for Mumps ?,"Anyone in direct contact with someone with mumps is at risk for the disease. Also, people who have not been vaccinated against mumps are at increased risk for the disease."

1300,What causes nail changes?,"Injury:
Crushing the base of the nail or the nail bed may cause a permanent deformity. Chronic picking or rubbing of the skin behind the nail can cause a washboard nail. Long-term exposure to moisture or nail polish can cause nails to peel and become brittle.
Infection:
Fungus or yeast cause changes in the color, texture, and shape of the nails. Bacterial infection may cause a change in nail color or painful areas of infection under the nail or in the surrounding skin. Severe infections may cause nail loss. Viral warts may cause a change in the shape of the nail or ingrown skin under the nail. Certain infections (especially of the heart valve) may cause red streaks in the nail bed (splinter hemorrhages).
Diseases:
Disorders that affect the amount of oxygen in the blood (such as abnormal heart anatomy and lung diseases including cancer or infection) may cause clubbing. Kidney disease can cause a build-up of nitrogen waste products in the blood, which can damage nails. Liver disease can damage nails. Thyroid diseases such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may cause brittle nails or splitting of the nail bed from the nail plate (onycholysis). Severe illness or surgery may cause horizontal depressions in the nails (Beau's lines). Psoriasis may cause pitting, splitting of the nail plate from the nail bed, and chronic destruction of the nail plate (nail dystrophy). Other conditions that can affect the appearance of the nails include systemic amyloidosis, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, and lichen planus. Skin cancers near the nail and fingertip can distort the nail. Subungal melanoma is a potentially deadly cancer that will normally appear as a dark streak down the length of the nail. Darkening of the cuticle associated with a pigmented streak may be a sign of an aggressive melanoma.
Poisons:
Arsenic poisoning may cause white lines and horizontal ridges. Silver intake can cause a blue nail.
Medications:
Certain antibiotics can cause lifting of the nail from the nail bed. Chemotherapy medicines can affect nail growth.
Normal aging affects the growth and development of the nails."
1301,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nail changes ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
A new or widening dark streak in the nail Blue nails Clubbed nails Distorted nails Horizontal ridges Pale nails White lines White color under the nails

1302,What are the symptoms of Peripheral neurofibromatosis or Neurofibromatosis type 1?,"Neurofibromatosis causes unchecked growth of tissue along the nerves. This can put pressure on affected nerves and cause pain, severe nerve damage, and loss of function in the area served by the nerve. Problems with sensation or movement can occur, depending on the nerves affected.
The condition can be very different from person to person, even among people in the same family who have the NF1 gene.
The coffee -with- milk (café-au-lait) spots are the hallmark symptom of neurofibromatosis. Although many healthy people have 1 or 2 small café-au-lait spots, adults with 6 or more spots greater than 1.5 cm in diameter are likely to have neurofibromatosis. In most people with the condition, these spots may be the only symptom.
Other symptoms may include:
Blindness Convulsions Freckles in the underarm or groin Large, soft tumors called plexiform neurofibromas, which may have a dark color and may spread under the surface of the skin Pain (from affected peripheral nerves) Small, rubbery tumors of the skin called nodular neurofibromas"
1303,What causes Peripheral neurofibromatosis or Neurofibromatosis type 1?,"NF1 is an inherited disease. If either parent has NF1, each of their children has a 50% chance of having the disease.
NF1 also appears in families with no previous history of the condition, as a result of a new gene change (mutation) in the sperm or egg. NF1 is caused by abnormalities in a gene for a protein called neurofibromin."
1304,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neurofibroma ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You notice coffee -with- milk colored spots on your child's skin or any of the signs listed here. You have a family history of neurofibromatosis and are planning to have children, or would like to have your child examined."
1305,What to expect if I have Neurofibroma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If there are no complications, the life expectancy of people with neurofibromatosis is almost normal. With the right education and job expectations, people with neurofibromatosis can live a normal life.
Although mental impairment is generally mild, NF1 is a known cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in a small number of patients. Learning disabilities are a common problem.
Some people are treated differently because they have hundreds of tumors on their skin.
Patients with neurofibromatosis have an increased chance of developing severe tumors. In rare cases, these can shorten a person's lifespan."
1306,What are the symptoms of Paget's disease of the breast?,"Early signs of Paget's disease of the breast does nmake the patient's attention. As the tumor grows, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:

Compared with the surrounding normal skin, warts may appear light, dark, or black (rare). Most adults are familiar with the look of a typical wart and have little trouble recognizing it. Unusual warts with smooth surfaces or flat warts in children may be more difficult for parents to recognize. Common warts tend to cause no discomfort unless they are in areas of repeated friction or pressure. Plantar warts, for example, can become extremely painful. Large numbers of plantar warts on the foot may cause difficulty walking or running. Some warts will disappear without treatment, although it can sometimes take a couple of years. Treated or not, warts that go away often reappear. All warts can spread from one part of your own body to another. Unsightly or painful warts can be treated.

1335,What causes Poison ivy?,"The rash is caused by skin contact with the oils (resin) of these plants. Smoke from burning these plants can cause the same reaction. The oils usually enter the skin rapidly. It is rarely spread from person to person.
The rash does not spread by the fluid from the blisters. Therefore, once a person has washed the oil completely off the skin, the rash is usually not contagious.
Keep in mind that the plant oils may remain for a long time on contaminated clothing, pets, tools, shoes, and other surfaces. These contaminated items can cause rashes in the future if they are not properly cleaned."

1342,What are the symptoms of a Pressure ulcer?,"A pressure ulcer starts as reddened skin that gets worse over time. It forms a blister, then an open sore, and finally a crater.
The most common places for pressure ulcers to form are over bones close to the skin, like the elbow, heels, hips, ankles, shoulders, back, and back of the head.
Pressure sores are categorized by how severe they are, from Stage I (earliest signs) to Stage IV (worst):
Stage I: A reddened area on the skin that, when pressed, does not turn white. This indicates that a pressure ulcer is starting to develop. Stage II: The skin blisters or forms an open sore. The area around the sore may be red and irritated. Stage III: The skin breakdown now looks like a crater. There is damage to the tissue below the skin. Stage IV: The pressure ulcer has become so deep that there is damage to the muscle and bone, and sometimes to tendons and joints."
1343,What causes a Pressure ulcer?,"Pressure against the skin reduces blood supply to that area, and the affected tissue dies. This may happen when you stay in one position for too long without shifting your weight. You might get a pressure ulcer if you use a wheelchair or are confined to a bed, even for a short period of time (for example, after surgery or an injury)."
1344,Who is at highest risk for Pressure ulcer ?,"The following factors increase the risk for pressure ulcers:
Being bedridden or in a wheelchair Being older Being unable to move certain parts of your body without help, such as after a spine or brain injury or if you have a disease like multiple sclerosis Having a chronic condition, such as diabetes or vascular disease, that prevents areas of the body from receiving proper blood flow Having a mental disability from conditions such as Alzheimer's disease Having fragile skin Having urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence Not getting enough nourishment (malnourishment)"

1350,What are the symptoms of Psoriasis?,"Psoriasis can appear suddenly or slowly. In many cases, psoriasis goes away and then flares up again repeatedly over time.
People with psoriasis have irritated patches of skin. The redness is most often seen on the elbows, knees, and trunk, but it can appear anywhere on the body. For example, there may be flaky patches on the scalp.
The skin patches or dots may be: Itchy Dry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales) Pink-red in color (like the color of salmon) Raised and thick
Other symptoms may include: Genital lesions in males Joint pain or aching (psoriatic arthritis) Nail changes, including: Nail thickening Yellow-brown spots Indentation (pitting) on the nail surface Separation of the nail from the base Severe dandruff on the scalp

Erythrodermic: The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area. Guttate: Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. Inverse: Skin redness and irritation occurs in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin. Plaque: Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales. This is the most common type of psoriasis. Pustular: White blisters are surrounded by red, irritated skin."
1351,What causes Psoriasis?,"Psoriasis cannot be spread to others. Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families. Doctors think it probably occurs when the body's immune system mistakes healthy cells for dangerous substances. Skin cells grow deep in the skin and normally rise to the surface about once a month. In persons with psoriasis, this process is too fast (about 2 weeks instead of 4 weeks) and dead skin cells build up on the skin's surface. The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make the condition more difficult to treat:
Bacteria or viral infections, including strep throat and upper respiratory infections Dry air or dry skin Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites Some medicines, including antimalarial drugs, beta-blockers, and lithium Stress Too little sunlight Too much sunlight (sunburn) Too much alcohol
In general, psoriasis may be severe in people who have a weakened immune system. This may include persons who have:
AIDS Autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis) Cancer chemotherapy
Up to one-third of people with psoriasis may also have arthritis, a condition known as psoriatic arthritis."

Chemicals in elastic, latex, and rubber products Cosmetics, soaps, and detergents Dyes and other chemicals in clothing Poison ivy, oak, or sumac
Seborrheic dermatitis is a rash that appears in patches of redness and scaling around the eyebrows, eyelids, mouth, nose, the trunk, and behind the ears. If it happens on your scalp, it is called dandruff in adults and cradle cap in infants.
Other common causes of a rash include:
Eczema (atopic dermatitis) -- tends to happen in people with allergies or asthma. The rash is generally red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis -- tends to occur as red, scaly, itchy patches over joints and along the scalp. Fingernails may be affected. Impetigo -- common in children, this infection is from bacteria that live in the top layers of the skin. Appears as red sores that turn into blisters, ooze, then crust over. Shingles -- a painful blistered skin condition caused by the same virus as chickenpox. The virus can lie dormant in your body for many years and re-emerge as shingles. Childhood illnesses such as chicken pox, measles, roseola, rubella, hand-foot-mouth disease, fifth disease, and scarlet fever. Medications and insect bites or stings.

Many primary care providers are comfortable dealing with common rashes, but for more complicated skin disorders, a referral to a dermatologist may be necessary."
1361,What are the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon?,"Strong emotions or exposure to the cold causes the fingers, toes, ears, or nose to become white, then turn blue. When blood flow returns, the area becomes red and then later returns to normal color. The attacks may last from minutes to hours.
People with primary Raynaud's phenomenon (no other cause or condition) have problems in the same fingers on both sides, but they do not have very much pain.
People with Raynaud's phenomenon associated with other medical conditions are more likely to have pain or tingling in different fingers. The pain is rarely severe. There may be ulcers on the affected fingers."
1362,What causes Raynaud's phenomenon?,"Raynaud's phenomenon can be associated with other conditions. This is called secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Most people with the condition are over age 30.

1366,What are the symptoms of Ringworm?,"Symptoms of ringworm include:
Itchy, red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze. The patches tend to have sharply-defined edges. Red patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. This may look like a ring.
If ringworm affects your hair, you will have bald patches.
If ringworm affects your nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble."
1367,What causes Ringworm?,"Ringworm is common, especially among children. However, it may affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.
Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus called tinea grows and multiplies on your skin.
Ringwork can affect the skin on your:
Beard -- tinea barbae Body -- tinea corporis Feet -- tinea pedis (also called athlete's foot) Groin area -- tinea cruris (also called jock itch) Scalp -- tinea capitis"

Eye redness Irritability Runny nose Sore throat High fever, that comes on quickly and may be as high as 105° F (40.5° C) and can last 3 to 7 days.
About 2 to 4 days after becoming sick, the child's fever lowers and a rash appears. This rash most often:
Starts on the middle of the body and spreads to the arms, legs, neck, and face Is pink or rose-colored Has small sores that are slightly raised The rash lasts from a few hours to 2 to 3 days. It usually does not itch."
1382,What are the symptoms of Rubella?,"Children generally have few symptoms. Adults may experience a fever, headache, general discomfort (malaise), and a runny nose before the rash appears. They may not notice the symptoms. Other symptoms may include:
Bruising (rare) Inflammation of the eyes (bloodshot eyes) Muscle or joint pain"
1383,What causes Rubella?,"The disease is caused by a virus that is spread through the air or by close contact.
A person can transmit the disease from 1 week before the rash begins, until 1 - 2 weeks after the rash disappears. The disease is less contagious than rubeola (measles). After an infection, people have immunity to the disease for the rest of their lives.
In children and adults, rubella is usually mild and may even go unnoticed."
1384,Who is at highest risk for Rubella ?,Not being vaccinated against rubella Exposure to an active rubella virus
1385,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rubella ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You are a woman of childbearing age and are unsure of whether you have been vaccinated against rubella You or your child develop a severe headache, stiff neck, earache, or vision problems during or after a case of rubella You or your child need to receive MMR immunization (vaccine)"
1386,What to expect if I have Rubella  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Rubella is usually a mild infection. However, if a mother is infected during early pregnancy, rubella can cause defects in the developing baby. The unborn baby can develop congenital rubella syndrome, which typically has a poor outcome. Defects are rare if the infection occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy."
1387,What are the symptoms of Scabies?,"Itching, especially at night Rashes, especially between the fingers Sores (abrasions) on the skin from scratching and digging Thin, pencil-mark lines on the skin
Mites may be more widespread on a baby's skin, causing pimples over the trunk, or small blisters over the palms and soles.
In young children, the head, neck, shoulders, palms, and soles are involved. In older children and adults, the hands, wrists, genitals, and abdomen are involved."
1388,What causes Scabies?,"Scabies is found worldwide among people of all groups and ages. It is spread by direct contact with infected people, and less often by sharing clothing or bedding. Sometimes whole families are affected.
Outbreaks of scabies are more common in nursing homes, nursing facilities, and child care centers.
The mites that cause scabies burrow into the skin and deposit their eggs, forming a burrow that looks like a pencil mark. Eggs mature in 21 days. The itchy rash is an allergic response to the mite."
1389,Who is at highest risk for Scabies ?,"Scabies is spread by skin-to-skin contact with another person who has scabies.
Pets and animals cannot spread human scabies. It is also not very likely for scabies to be spread by:
A swimming pool Contact with the towels, bedding, and clothing of someone who has scabies, unless the person has what is called ""crusted scabies"""
1390,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Scabies ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of scabies A person you have been in close contact with has been diagnosed with scabies"
1391,What to expect if I have Scabies  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most cases of scabies can be cured without any long-term problems. A severe case with a lot of scaling or crusting may be a sign that the person has a disease such as HIV.
1392,What are the symptoms of Scarlet fever?,"The most common symptoms of scarlet fever are:
Scarlet fever begins with a rash that shows up as tiny red bumps. It most often begins on the chest and stomach but can then spread all over the body. It looks like a sunburn and feels like a rough piece of sandpaper. Most of the time it is redder in the creases of the elbows, arm pits, and groin areas. The rash lasts about 2-7 days. After the rash is gone, the skin on the tips of the fingers and toes begins to peel. Some other common signs of scarlet fever are: A flush face with a pale area around the lips; A red and sore throat that can have white or yellow patches; A fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) or higher; Swollen glands in the neck; and A whitish coating can appear on the surface of the tongue. The tongue itself looks like a strawberry because the normal bumps on the tongue look bigger.
Other less common signs of illness include:
Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) and throwing up (vomiting); Having a headache; and Having body aches."
1393,What causes Scarlet fever?,"This illness can be caught from contact with the sick person because this germ is carried in the mouth and nasal fluids. The disease can be spread through contact with droplets shed when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes after touching something that has these fluids on them, you may become ill. Also, if you drink from the same glass or eat from the same plate as the sick person, you could also become ill. The best way to keep from getting sick is to wash your hands often and avoid sharing eating utensils. It is especially important for anyone with a sore throat to wash his or her hands often and not share eating or drinking utensils."
1394,Who is at highest risk for Scarlet fever ?,"Scarlet fever usually develops in children, just like colds or the flu are common in children."
1395,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Scarlet fever ?,"If you think your child has scarlet fever, take your child to his or her doctor right away. The doctor may give your child drugs that fight germs (antibiotics). Do not let your child return to daycare or school until he or she has taken the antibiotics for at least 24 hours."
1396,What to expect if I have Scarlet fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Although complications may arise if not treated, scarlet fever goes away after a course of antibiotics."
1397,What are the symptoms of Scleroderma?,"Some types of scleroderma affect only the skin, while others affect the whole body.
Localized scleroderma usually affects only the skin on the hands and face. It develops slowly, and rarely, if ever, spreads throughout the body or causes serious complications. Systemic scleroderma, or sclerosis, may affect large areas of skin and organs such as the heart, lungs, or kidneys. There are two main types of systemic scleroderma: Limited disease (CREST syndrome) and diffuse disease.
Skin symptoms of scleroderma may include:
Fingers or toes that turn blue or white in response to hot and cold temperatures (See: Raynaud's phenomenon) Hair loss Skin hardness Skin that is abnormally dark or light Skin thickening, stiffness, and tightness of fingers, hands, and forearm Small white lumps beneath the skin, sometimes oozing a white substance that looks like toothpaste Sores (ulcers) on the fingertips or toes Tight and mask-like skin on the face
Bone and muscle symptoms may include:
Joint pain Numbness and pain in the feet Pain, stiffness, and swelling of fingers and joints Wrist pain
Breathing problems may result from scarring in the lungs and can include:
Dry cough Shortness of breath Wheezing
Digestive tract problems may include:
Bloating after meals Constipation Diarrhea Difficulty swallowing Esophageal reflux or heartburn Problems controlling stools (fecal incontinence)"
1398,What causes Scleroderma?,The cause of scleroderma is unknown. People with this condition have a buildup of a substance called collagen in the skin and other organs. This buildup leads to the symptoms of the disease.
1399,Who is at highest risk for Scleroderma ?,"The disease usually affects people 30 to 50 years old. Women get scleroderma more often than men do. Some people with scleroderma have a history of being around silica dust and polyvinyl chloride, but most do not.
Widespread scleroderma can occur with other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and polymyositis. In such cases, the disorder is referred to as mixed connective disease."
1400,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Scleroderma ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of scleroderma You have scleroderma and symptoms become worse or new symptoms develop"
1401,What to expect if I have Scleroderma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some people with scleroderma have symptoms that develop quickly over the first few years and continue to get worse. However, in most patients, the disease slowly gets worse. People who only have skin symptoms have a better outlook. Widespread (systemic) scleroderma can damage the heart, kidney, lungs, or GI tract, which may cause death. Lung problems are the most common cause of death in patients with scleroderma."
1402,What are the symptoms of Sebaceous cysts?,"The main symptom is usually a small, non-painful lump beneath the skin.
If the lump becomes infected or inflammed, other symptoms may include:
Skin redness Tender or sore skin Warm skin in the affected area
Grayish-white, cheesy, foul-smelling material may drain from the cyst."
1403,What causes Sebaceous cysts?,"Sebaceous cysts most often arise from swollen hair follicles. Skin trauma can also induce a cyst to form. A sac of cells is created into which a protein called keratin is secreted.
These cysts are usually found on the face, neck, and trunk. They are usually slow- growing, painless, freely movable lumps beneath the skin. Occasionally, however, a cyst will become inflamed and tender."
1404,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sebaceous cysts ?,"Call your health care provider if you notice any new growths on your body. Although cysts are not dangerous, your doctor should examine you for signs of skin cancer."
1405,What to expect if I have Sebaceous cysts  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Large, painful cysts may interfere with day-to-day life."
1406,What are the symptoms of Seborrheic dermatitis?,"Seborrheic dermatitis can occur on many different body areas. Usuallky it forms where the skin is oily or greasy. Commonly affected areas include the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, creases of the nose, lips, behind the ears, in the outer ear, and middle of the chest.
Seborrheic dermatitis in infants, also called cradle cap, is a harmless, temporary condition. It appears as thick, crusty, yellow or brown scales over the child's scalp. Similar scales may also be found on the eyelids, ear, around the nose, and in the groin. Cradle cap may be seen in newborns and small children up to age 3.
Cradle cap is not contagious, nor is it caused by poor hygiene. It is not an allergy, and it is not dangerous. Cradle cap may or may not itch. If it itches, excessive scratching of the area may cause additional inflammation, and breaks in skin may cause mild infections or bleeding.
In general, symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis include:
Skin lesions Plaques over large area Greasy, oily areas of skin Skin scales -- white and flaking, or yellowish, oily, and adherent -- ""dandruff"" Itching -- may become more itchy if infected Mild redness Hair loss"
1407,What causes Seborrheic dermatitis?,Seborrheic dermatitis is thought to be due to a combination of an over production of skin oil and irritation from a yeast called malessizia.
1408,Who is at highest risk for Seborrheic dermatitis ?,"Seborrheic dermatitis appears to run in families. Stress, fatigue, weather extremes, oily skin, infrequent shampoos or skin cleaning, use of lotions that contain alcohol, skin disorders (such as acne), or obesity may increase the risk.
Neurologic conditions, including Parkinson's disease, head injury, and stroke may be associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has also been linked to increased cases of seborrheic dermatitis."
1409,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Seborrheic dermatitis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if seborrheic dermatitis symptoms do not respond to self-care or over-the-counter treatments.
Also call if patches of seborrheic dermatitis drain fluid or pus, form crusts, or become very red or painful."
1410,What to expect if I have Seborrheic dermatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic (life-long) condition that can be controlled with treatment. It often has extended inactive periods followed by flare-ups. A more extreme form of this condition overlaps with psoriasis of the scalp and is called sebopsoriasis.
1411,What are the symptoms of Shingles?,"The first symptom is usually one-sided pain, tingling, or burning. The pain and burning may be severe and is usually present before any rash appears.
Red patches on the skin, followed by small blisters, form in most people.
The blisters break, forming small ulcers that begin to dry and form crusts. The crusts fall off in 2 to 3 weeks. Scarring is rare. The rash usually involves a narrow area from the spine around to the front of the belly area or chest. The rash may involve face, eyes, mouth, and ears.
Additional symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain Chills Difficulty moving some of the muscles in the face Drooping eyelid (ptosis) Fever and chills General ill-feeling Genital lesions Headache Hearing loss Joint pain Loss of eye motion Swollen glands (lymph nodes) Taste problems Vision problems
You may also have pain, muscle weakness, and a rash involving different parts of your face if shingles affects a nerve in your face."
1412,What causes Shingles?,"After you get chickenpox, the virus remains inactive (becomes dormant) in certain nerves in the body. Shingles occurs after the virus becomes active again in these nerves years later.
The reason the virus suddenly become active again is not clear. Often only one attack occurs."
1413,Who is at highest risk for Shingles ?,"Shingles may develop in any age group, but you are more likely to develop the condition if:
You are older than 60 You had chickenpox before age 1 Your immune system is weakened by medications or disease
If an adult or child has direct contact with the shingles rash on someone and has not had chickenpox as a child or a chickenpox vaccine, they can develop chickenpox, rather than shingles."
1414,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Shingles ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of shingles, particularly if you have a weakened immune system or if your symptoms persist or worsen. Shingles that affects the eye may lead to permanent blindness if you do not receive emergency medical care."
1415,What to expect if I have Shingles  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Herpes zoster usually clears in 2 to 3 weeks and rarely recurs. If the virus affects the nerves that control movement (the motor nerves), you may have temporary or permanent weakness or paralysis.
Sometimes, the pain in the area where the shingles occurred may last from months to years. See: Postherpetic neuralgia"
1416,What are the symptoms of Sporotrichosis?,"Symptoms include a small, painless, red lump that develops at the site of infection. As time passes, this lump will turn into an ulcer (sore). The lump may develop up to 3 months after an injury.
Most lesions are on the hands and forearms, because these areas are commonly injured when handling plants. In children, lesions may be more likely to manifest on the face.
The fungus may follow the channels in your body's lymphatic system. Small ulcers appear as lines on the skin as the infection moves up an arm or leg. These sores do not heal unless they are treated, and they may last for years. The sores may sometimes drain small amounts of pus.
Body-wide (systemic) sporotrichosis can cause lung and breathing problems, bone infection, arthritis, and infection of the nervous system."
1417,What causes Sporotrichosis?,"Sporothrix schenckii is found in plants. Infection commonly occurs when the skin is broken while handling plant materials such as rosebushes, briars, or dirt that contains a lot of mulch.
Sporotrichosis can be a job-related disease for people who work with plants, such as farmers, horticulturists, rose gardeners, and plant nursery workers. Widespread (disseminated) sporotrichosis can develop in people with a weakened immune system when they inhale dust filled with spores of the fungus."
1418,Who is at highest risk for Sporotrichosis ?,"People who handle thorny plants, sphagnum moss, or bales of hay are at increased risk of getting sporotrichosis. The infection is more common among people with weakened immune systems, but it can also occur in otherwise healthy people. Outbreaks have occurred among florists, plant nursery workers who have handled sphagnum moss, rose gardeners, children who have played on bales of hay, and greenhouse workers who have handled thorns contaminated by the fungus."
1419,What to expect if I have Sporotrichosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, full recovery is likely. Disseminated sporotrichosis is more difficult to treat and requires several months of therapy. Disseminated sporotrichosis can be life-threatening for people with a weakened immune system."
1420,What are the symptoms of Squamous cell carcinoma?,"General appearance is a rough, flat reddish patch, but special attention needs to be given to the following:
Any new growth
A mark or bump that is increasing in size
A sore or ulcer that doesn't heal within three months
Many skin problems can cause lesions that are similar in appearance to squamous cell carcinoma. A dermatologist will need to assess the lesion to confirm the exact nature of it. Any person with suspicious skin markings and changes should seek help from a dermatologist immediately to ensure that it is diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Conditions with symptoms similar to sqaumous cell carcinoma are:
Eczema
Condyloma acuminata or genital warts
Skin ulcer
Keratoacanthoma"
1421,Who is at highest risk for Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin ?,"Clinical data suggests that the development of squamous cell carcinoma is related to several factors.
Sunlight(solar UV radiation): Excessive exposure to sunlight is thought to be the largest risk factor for developing squamous cell carcinoma.
Fair skin: Data show that caucasian persons and persons with fair skin are at higher risk for skin cancer than darker skinned persons.
Genetic factors: Some persons are genetically more at risk to develop skin cancer, and may have a history of skin cancer in their family.
Immunosuppressive factors: Persons who have been treated with immunosuppressive medications such as transplant patients, have an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP): Patients with XP are at higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma because thay cannot repair the damage caused by sunlight.
Chemical exposure: Work exposure to large amounts of arsenic, tar, coal, or paraffin increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.
Radiation exposure
Age: Epidemiological data suggests that the risk of squamous cell carcinoma increases with age.
Gender: Men are at greater risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma than women."
1422,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin ?,See your dermatologist if you get any new or rapidly growing lesions on the skin.
1423,What to expect if I have Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma depends on the following:
The stage of squamous cell carcinoma: Whether cancer is found in the skin only, or whether is has invaded the layer below the skin and has spread to the lymph nodes, or to other distant places in the body.
The location and the size of the tumor.
The patient’s general health."
1424,What are the symptoms of Stasis dermatitis and ulcers?,"You may have symptoms of venous insufficiency, which include a dull aching or heaviness in the leg and pain that gets worse when you stand.
At first, the skin of the ankles and lower legs may look thin or tissue-like. You may slowly get brown stains on the skin.
If you scratch the area, the skin may become irritated or crack. It may also become red or swollen, crusted, or weepy.
Over time, some skin changes become permanent:
Thickening and hardening of the skin on the legs and ankles (lipodermatosclerosis) A bumpy or cobblestone appearance of the skin Dark brown color
Skin sores (ulcers) may develop (called a venous ulcer or stasis ulcer). These most often form on the inside of the ankle."
1425,What causes Stasis dermatitis and ulcers?,Venous insufficiency is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart.
1426,Who is at highest risk for Stasis dermatitis and ulcers ?,"Some people with venous insufficiency develop stasis dermatitis. Blood pools in the veins of the lower leg. Fluid and blood cells leak out of the veins into the skin and other tissues. This may lead to itching, which causes more skin changes."
1427,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stasis dermatitis and ulcers ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop leg swelling or symptoms of stasis dermatitis. Watch for signs of infection:
Drainage that looks like pus Open skin sores (ulcers) Pain Redness"
1428,What to expect if I have Stasis dermatitis and ulcers  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop leg swelling or symptoms of stasis dermatitis. Watch for signs of infection:
Drainage that looks like pus Open skin sores (ulcers) Pain Redness"
1429,What are the symptoms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome?,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) usually begins with a fever, sore throat, and fatigue, which is misdiagnosed and usually treated with antibiotics. Skin eruption occurs 1-3 days after the flu-like symptoms. Skin lesions start as red or reddish blue lesions on the trunk and extremities and later increase in size and combine. Blisters, erosions, and vesicles are also seen
Ulcers and other lesions also begin to appear in the mucous membranes, almost always in the mouth and lips but also in the genital and anal regions. Those in the mouth are usually extremely painful and reduce the patient's ability to eat or drink. Conjunctivitis of the eyes occurs in about 30% of children who develop SJS. A rash of round lesions about an inch across arises on the face, trunk, arms and legs, and soles of the feet, but usually not the scalp."
1430,What causes Stevens-Johnson syndrome?,"Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is caused by drug reactions in the majority of the cases although it is also seen in certain viral and bacterial infections, and certain malignancies. Most commonly implicated drugs include sulfa drugs, allopurinol, anti-epileptics (Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine), antibiotics (for example Penicillin), and NSAIDs. Infections that are associated with SJS may include HIV, Herpes Simplex Virus, Mumps, Mycoplasma, Mycobacteria, Hepatitis, and Streptococcal Infection."
1431,Who is at highest risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome ?,"Common risk factors in the development of SJS include Low immunity, HIV infection, active cancers (particularly Blood cancers), genetic Predisposition (HLA-B 1502 and HLA-B 5801 variants in particular) on exposure to anti-epileptic medications or allopurinol. Other risk factors may include past or family history of SJS/TEN, Rradiation therapy and rapid use of medications."
1432,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stevens-Johnson syndrome ?,Urgent Medical Care should be sought in case of skin eruptions or rash along with flu-like symptoms following a drug use or otherwise.
1433,What to expect if I have Stevens-Johnson syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is generally good. Most lesions heal rapidly within 1-3 weeks unless secondary bacterial infection of lesions occurs. Recovery can take longer, although it usually depends on the severity of symptoms and body surface area involved. The mortality rate is 1-5 percent in SJS and in TEN is 25-35 percent"
1434,What are the symptoms of Striae?,"Stretch marks can appear when there is rapid stretching of the skin. They are often associated with the abdominal enlargement of pregnancy. They can be found in children who have become rapidly obese. They may also occur during the rapid growth of puberty in males and females. Striae are most commonly located on the breasts, hips, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, and flank.
Stretch marks appear as parallel streaks of red, thinned, glossy skin that over time become whitish and scarlike in appearance. The stretch marks may be slightly depressed and have a different texture than normal skin.
Striae may also occur as a result of abnormal collagen formation, or a result of medications or chemicals that interfere with collagen formation. They may also be associated with longtime use of cortisone compounds, diabetes, Cushing disease, and post-pregnancy."
1435,What causes Striae?,Cushing syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Pregnancy Puberty Obesity Overuse of cortisone skin creams
1436,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Striae ?,"If striae or stretch marks appear without obvious cause such as pregnancy or rapid weight gain, call your health care provider."
1437,What to expect if I have Striae  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"You health care provider will examine you and ask questions about your symptoms, including:
Is this the first time that you have developed striae? When did you first notice the stretchmarks? What medicines have you taken? Have you used a cortisone skin cream? What other symptoms do you have?
If the striae are not caused by normal physical changes, tests may be done."
1438,What are the symptoms of Strongyloidiasis?,"Most of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include:
Abdominal pain (upper abdomen) Cough Diarrhea Rash Vomiting Weight loss"
1439,What causes Strongyloidiasis?,"S. stercoralis is a roundworm that is fairly common in warm, moist areas. Rarely, it can be found as far north as Canada. People catch the infection when their skin comes in contact with soil contaminated with the worms. The tiny worm is barely visible to the naked eye. Young roundworms can move through a person's skin and into the bloodstream to the lungs and airways. They then move up to the throat, where they are swallowed into the stomach. The worms then move to the small intestine, where they attach to the wall. Later, they produce eggs, which hatch into tiny larvae and pass out of the body. Unlike other worms, these larvae can reenter the body through the skin around the anus, which allows an infection to grow. Areas where the worms go through the skin may become red and painful. This infection is uncommon in the United States. Most cases seen in North America are brought by travelers who have visited or lived in South America or Africa."
1440,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Strongyloidiasis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of strongyloidiasis.
1441,What to expect if I have Strongyloidiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With good treatment, people should make a full recovery and the parasites should be removed. Sometimes treatment needs to be repeated. Infections that are severe or widespread often have a poor outcome, especially in people with a weakened immune system."
1442,What are the symptoms of Sturge-Weber syndrome?,Port-wine stain (more common on the face than the body) Seizures Paralysis or weakness on one side Learning disabilities
1443,What causes Sturge-Weber syndrome?,The cause of Sturge-Weber is unknown. It is not thought to be passed down (inherited) through families.
1444,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sturge-Weber syndrome ?,"The health care provider should check all birthmarks, including a port-wine stain. Seizures, vision problems, paralysis, and changes in alertness or mental state may mean the coverings of the brain are involved. These symptoms should be evaluated right away."
1445,What to expect if I have Sturge-Weber syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases of Sturge-Weber are not life-threatening. The patient's quality of life depends on how well the symptoms (such as seizures) can be prevented or treated.
Patients will need to visit an ophthalmologist at least once a year to treat glaucoma. They also will need to see a neurologist to treat seizures and other neurologic symptoms."
1446,What are the symptoms of Sunburn?,"The first signs of a sunburn may not appear for a few hours. The full effect to your skin may not appear for 24 hours or longer. Possible symptoms include:
Red, tender skin that is warm to touch. Blisters that develop hours to days later. Severe reactions (sometimes called ""sun poisoning""), including fever, chills, nausea, or rash. Skin peeling on sunburned areas several days after the sunburn.
While the symptoms of sunburn are usually temporary (such as red skin that is painful to the touch), the skin damage is often permanent and can have serious long-term health effects, including skin cancer. By the time the skin starts to become painful and red, the damage has been done. The pain is worst between 6 and 48 hours after sun exposure.
In severe sunburns, blistering of the skin may occur. Deaths have resulted from acute sun exposure, and significant temporary disability is experienced by millions of sunburned people each year."
1447,What causes Sunburn?,"Sunburn results when the amount of exposure to the sun or other ultraviolet light source exceeds the ability of the body's protective pigment, melanin, to protect the skin. Sunburn in a very light-skinned person may occur in less than 15 minutes of midday sun exposure, while a dark-skinned person may tolerate the same exposure for hours.
Keep in mind:
There is no such thing as a ""healthy tan."" Unprotected sun exposure causes premature aging of the skin. Sun exposure can cause first and second degree burns. Skin cancer usually appears in adulthood, but is caused by sun exposure and sunburns that began as early as childhood. You can help prevent skin cancer by protecting your skin and your children's skin from the harmful rays of the sun."
1448,Who is at highest risk for Sunburn ?,"Factors that make sunburn more likely:
Infants and children are especially sensitive to the burning effects of the sun. People with fair skin are more likely to get sunburn. But even dark and black skin can burn and should be protected. The sun's rays are strongest during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The sun's rays are also stronger at higher altitudes and lower latitudes (closer to the tropics). Reflection off water, sand, or snow can intensify the sun's burning rays. Sun lamps can cause severe sunburn. Some medications (such as the antibiotic doxycycline) can make you more susceptible to sunburn."
1449,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sunburn ?,"Call a health care provider immediately if you have a fever with sunburn or if there are signs of shock, heat exhaustion, dehydration, or other serious reaction. These signs include:
Feeling faint or dizzy Rapid pulse or rapid breathing Extreme thirst, no urine output, or sunken eyes Pale, clammy, or cool skin Nausea, fever, chills, or rash Your eyes hurt and are sensitive to light Severe, painful blisters"
1450,What to expect if I have Sunburn  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The doctor will perform a physical exam and look at your skin. You may be asked questions about your medical history and current symptoms, including:
When did the sunburn occur? How often do you get sunburn? Do you have blisters? How much of the body was sunburned? What medicines do you take? Do you use a sunblock or sunscreen? What type? How strong? What other symptoms do you have?"
1451,What are the symptoms of Hyperhidrosis?,The primary symptom of hyperhidrosis is wetness.
1452,What causes Hyperhidrosis?,"Sweating helps the body stay cool. In most cases, it is perfectly natural. People sweat more in warm temperatures, when they exercise, or in response to situations that make them nervous, angry, embarrassed, or afraid.
However, excessive sweating occurs without such triggers. Those with hyperhidrosis appear to have overactive sweat glands. The uncontrollable sweating can lead to significant discomfort, both physical and emotional.
When excessive sweating affects the hands, feet, and armpits, it's called primary or focal hyperhidrosis.
If the sweating occurs as a result of another medical condition, it is called secondary hyperhidrosis. The sweating may be all over the body, or it may be in one area. Conditions that cause second hyperhidrosis include:
Acromegaly Anxiety conditions Cancer Carcinoid syndrome Certain medications and substances of abuse Glucose control disorders Heart disease Hyperthyroidism Lung disease Menopause Parkinson’s disease Pheochromocytoma Spinal cord injury Stroke Tuberculosis or other infections"
1453,Who is at highest risk for Sweat ?,"Primary hyperhidrosis affects 2 - 3% of the population, yet less than 40% of patients with this condition seek medical advice. In the majority of primary hyperhidrosis cases, no cause can be found. It seems to run in families."
1454,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sweat ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
Prolonged, excessive, and unexplained sweating Sweating with or followed by chest pain or pressure Sweating with weight loss Sweating that most often occurs during sleep Sweating with fever, weight loss, chest pain, shortness of breath, or a rapid, pounding heartbeat - these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying disease, such as hyperthyroidism"
1455,What to expect if I have Sweat  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Aluminum Chloride: Initially a patient may need to use it three to seven times a week. After sweating becomes normal, the person may need to use it only once every one to three weeks. If skin irritation is a problem, a doctor may temporarily prescribe a steroid-based cream.
Botox: Swelling goes away in a few weeks. The effect of a single injection can last up to a few months. Some patients need additional injections.
Iontophoresis: Sweating may be reduced after six to 10 sessions. After that, the person may need treatment once every one to four weeks."
1456,What are the symptoms of Systemic lupus erythematosus?,"Symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus vary from person to person, depending the organs affected. And the symptoms may come and go.
The most common symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus
Fatigue Low fever Muscle pain Joint pain Loss of appetite Facial butterfly rash Sensitivity to sunlight Chest pain Swollen lymph nodes Abnormal blood clotting
Other symptoms depends on the orgnas affected.

Skin: Lupus, systemic erythematosus; Discoid skin lesion in patient with SLE Skin: ulcer, necrotic; lupus anticoagulant in thigh Skin: lupus, erythematosus, subacute; Papulosquamous diseases Skin: lupus, erythematosus; Papulosquamous diseases Skin: lupus, erythematosus; papulosquamous diseases Skin: alopecia, secondary lupus erythematosus; hair loss Skin: discoid lupus, face
Diseases that can have similar symptoms are
Polyarthritis Pneumonitis Lung cancer Acute pericarditis"
1457,What causes Systemic lupus erythematosus?,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. This leads to long-term (chronic) inflammation.
The underlying cause of autoimmune diseases is not fully known. SLE is much more common in women than men. It may occur at any age, but appears most often in people between the ages of 10 and 50. African Americans and Asians are affected more often than people from other races.
SLE may also be caused by certain drugs. For information on this cause, see Drug-induced lupus erythematosus"
1458,Who is at highest risk for Systemic lupus erythematosus ?,"The underlying cause of this autoimmune disease is not clear. Clinical data show the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with the following factors:
Female: SLE affects nine times as many women as men. Age: From 10 to 50 Race: African Americans and Asians are affected more often than people from other races. Drugs, such as chlorpromazine, hydralazine, isoniazid, methyldopa, penicillamine, procainamide, quinidine and sulfasalazine."
1459,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Systemic lupus erythematosus ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus.
1460,What to expect if I have Systemic lupus erythematosus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Outcomes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus have improved in recent years. Prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus depends on:
The results of anti-phospholipid antibodies: Positive results may increase the possibility of pregnancy loss in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.
Whether the patient is involved of vital organs damage, such as the damages in brain, lungs, heart, and kidney."
1461,What are the symptoms of Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?,Bleeding into the skin or mucus membranes Changes in consciousness Confusion Easy fatigue Fever Headache Heart rate over 100 beats per minute Pallor Purplish spots in the skin produced by small bleeding vessels near the surface of the skin (purpura) Shortness of breath Speech changes Weakness Yellowish color to the skin (jaundice)
1462,What causes Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?,"This disease may be caused by a lack of, or problems with, a certain enzyme (a type of protein) that is involved in blood clotting. These changes cause clotting to occur in an abnormal way.
As the platelets clump together in these clots, fewer platelets are available in the blood in other parts of the body to help with clotting.
This can lead to bleeding under the skin and purple-colored spots called purpura.
In some cases, the disorder is passed down through families (inherited) and patients are born with naturally low levels of this enzyme. This condition also may be related to:
Bone marrow transplantation Cancer Chemotherapy Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HIV infection Hormone replacement therapy and estrogens Medications (including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, guinine, and cyclosporine A)"
1463,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ?,Call your health care provider if you have any unexplained bleeding.
1464,What to expect if I have Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Plasma exchange has greatly improved the outcome of this disease. Most patients now recover completely. However, some people die from this disease, especially if it is not found immediately. In people who don't recover, this condition can become long-term (chronic)."
1465,What are the symptoms of Tinea?,"The symptoms of ringworm include:
Itchy, red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze. The patches often have sharply-defined edges. They are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. This may create the appearance of a ring. Your skin may also appear unusually dark or light. When your scalp or beard is infected, you will have bald patches. If nails are infected, they become discolored, thick, and even crumble."
1466,What causes Tinea?,"Ringworm is a common skin disorder, especially among children, but it may affect people of all ages. Although its name suggests otherwise, it is caused by a fungus, not a worm. Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful to you and your body. Others can multiply rapidly and form infections."
1467,Who is at highest risk for Tinea ?,"Ringworm occurs when a particular type of fungus grows and multiplies anywhere on your skin, scalp, or nails. Ringworm is contagious. It can be passed from one person to the next by direct skin-to-skin contact or by contact with contaminated items such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets that carry the fungus. Cats are common carriers. The fungi that cause ringworm thrive in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you have frequent wetness (such as from sweating) and minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails."
1468,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tinea ?,"Call your doctor right away if you have any signs of a bacterial infection, which can result from scratching. These signs include swelling, warmth to the touch, sudden worsening in redness of the patches, red streaking, pus, discharge, and fever. Call your doctor if:
Ringworm infects your scalp or beard. Your skin does not improve after 4 weeks of self-care."
1469,What to expect if I have Tinea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Skin medication is usually successful at treating Ringworm within 4 weeks. If your ringworm infection is severe or resistant (meaning that it does not respond well to self-care), it will usually respond quickly to antifungal pills."
1470,What are the symptoms of Tinea capitis?,"Tinea capitis may involve only parts of the scalp, or all of it. Areas that are infected appear bald with small black dots, due to hair that has broken off.
Round, scaly areas of skin that can be red or swollen (inflamed) may be found, as well as pus-filled sores called kerions.
You may have a low-grade fever of around 100 - 101 Â°F or swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
There is usually itching of the scalp."
1471,What causes Tinea capitis?,"Fungi are a type of germ that can live on the dead tissue of the hair, nails, and outer skin layers. The body normally hosts a variety of fungi. Tinea capitis is caused by by mold-like fungi called dermatophytes.
The fungi that cause tinea infections do well in warm, moist areas. A tinea infection is more likely if you have:
Minor skin or scalp injuries Poor hygiene Wet skin for a long time (such as from sweating)"
1472,Who is at highest risk for Tinea capitis ?,"Tinea capitis or ringworm can spread easily to others. It most often affects children and goes away at puberty. However, it can occur at any age.
Tinea infections are contagious. You can catch tinea capitis if you come into direct contact with an area of ringworm on someone else's body, or if you touch items such as combs, hats, or clothing that have been used by someone with ringworm. The infection can also be spread by pets, particularly cats."
1473,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tinea capitis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of tinea capitis. Home care remedies do not effectively treat tinea capitis.
1474,What to expect if I have Tinea capitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Tinea capitis may be hard to get rid of, and it may return after treatment. In many cases it gets better on its own when the person reaches puberty."
1475,What are the symptoms of Tinea corporis?,"Symptoms may include itching.
The rash begins as a small area of red, raised spots and pimples. The rash slowly becomes ring-shaped, with a red-colored, raised border and a clearer center. The border may look scaly.
The rash may occur on the arms, legs, face, or other exposed body areas."
1476,What causes Tinea corporis?,"Tinea corporis is a common skin disorder among children. However, it may occur in people of all ages. It is caused by mold-like fungi called dermatophytes.
Fungi thrive in warm, moist areas. The following raise your risk for a fungal infection:
Long-term wetness of the skin (such as from sweating) Minor skin and nail injuries Poor hygiene"
1477,Who is at highest risk for Tinea corporis ?,"Tinea corporis can spread easily to other people. You can catch the condition if you come into direct contact with an area of ringworm on someone's body, or if you touch contaminated items such as:
Clothing Combs Pool surfaces Shower floors and walls
The fungi can also be spread by pets (cats are common carriers)."
1478,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tinea corporis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if ringworm does not improve with self-care.
1479,What to expect if I have Tinea corporis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Ringworm usually responds to topical medications within 4 weeks. Severe or resistant cases usually respond quickly to antifungal medicines taken by mouth.
1480,What are the symptoms of Tinea versicolor?,"The main symptom is patches of discolored skin with sharp borders (edges) and fine scales. The patches are often dark reddish-tan in color. The most common sites are the back, underarms, upper arms, chest, and neck. Affected areas do not darken in the sun (skin may appear lighter than surrounding healthy skin)
In African Americans, there may be loss of skin color (hypopigmentation) or an increase in skin color (hyperpigmentation).
Other symptoms include:
Increased sweating Itching"
1481,What causes Tinea versicolor?,"Tinea versicolor is relatively common. It is caused by the fungus Pityrosporum ovale, a type of yeast that is normally found on human skin. It only causes problems under certain circumstances."
1482,Who is at highest risk for Tinea versicolor ?,The condition is most common in adolescent and young adult males. It typically occurs in hot climates.
1483,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tinea versicolor ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of tinea versicolor.
1484,What to expect if I have Tinea versicolor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Though tinea versicolor is easily treated, pigment changes may last for months after treatment. The condition may come back during the warm months."
1485,What are the symptoms of Trichotillomania?,"Symptoms usually begin before age 17.
The hair may come out in round patches or across the scalp. The effect is an uneven appearance. The person may pluck other hairy areas, such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, or body hair.
These symptoms are usually seen in children:
An uneven appearance to the hair Bare patches or all around (diffuse) loss of hair Bowel blockage (obstruction) if people eat the hair they pull out Constant tugging, pulling, or twisting of hair Denying the hair pulling Hair regrowth that feels like stubble in the bare spots Increasing sense of tension before the hair pulling Other self-injury behaviors Sense of relief, pleasure, or gratification after the hair pulling
Most people with this disorder also have problems with:
Feeling sad or depressed Anxiety Poor self image"
1486,What causes Trichotillomania?,"Trichotillomania is a type of impulsive control disorder. Its causes are not clearly understood.
It may affect as much as 4% of the population. Women are four times more likely to be affected than men."
1487,What to expect if I have Trichotillomania  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Trichotillomania that begins in younger children (fewer than 6 years old) may go away without treatment. For most, the hair pulling ends within 12 months.
For others, trichotillomania is a lifelong disorder.
Treatment often improves the hair pulling and the feelings of depression, anxiety, or poor self image."
1488,What are the symptoms of Vitiligo?,"Flat areas of normal-feeling skin without any pigment appear suddenly or gradually. These areas have a darker border. The edges are well defined but irregular. Vitiligo most often affects the face, elbows and knees, hands and feet, and genitalia. Vitiligo affects both sides of the body equally. Vitiligo is more noticeable in darker-skinned people because of the contrast of white patches against dark skin. No other skin changes occur."
1489,What causes Vitiligo?,"Vitiligo appears to occur when immune cells destroy the cells that produce brown pigment (melanocytes). This destruction is thought to be due to an autoimmune problem, but the cause is unknown.
Vitiligo is associated with three other autoimmune diseases:
Addison's disease Hyperthyroidism Pernicious anemia"
1490,Who is at highest risk for Vitiligo ?,Vitiligo may appear at any age. There is an increased rate of the condition in some families. The condition affects about 1 out of every 100 people in the United States.
1491,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vitiligo ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if areas of your skin lose their coloring for no reason (for example, there was no injury to the skin)."
1492,What to expect if I have Vitiligo  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The course of vitiligo varies and is unpredictable. Some areas may regain normal pigment (coloring), but other new areas of pigment loss may appear. Skin that is repigmented may be slightly lighter or darker than the surrounding skin. Pigment loss may get worse over time."
1493,What are the symptoms of Warts?,"Warts are classified based on where they appear on the body. The different types of warts include:
Common warts usually appear on the hands, but can appear anywhere. Flat warts are generally found on the face and forehead. They are common in children, less common in teens, and rare in adults. Genital warts (condyloma) are usually found on the genitals, in the pubic area, and in the area between the thighs, but they can also appear inside the vagina and anal canal. Plantar warts are found on the soles of the feet. Subungual and periungual warts appear under and around the fingernails or toenails. Abnormally dark or light skin surrounding the lesion Numerous small, smooth, flat (pinhead sized) lesions on forehead, cheeks, arms, or legs Rough growths around or under fingernails or toenails Rough, round, or oval lesions on soles of feet -- flat to slightly raised -- painful to pressure Small, hard, flat or raised skin lesion or lump"
1494,What causes Warts?,"The typical wart is a raised round or oval growth on the skin with a rough surface. Compared with the surrounding normal skin, warts may appear light, dark, or black (rare). Most adults are familiar with the look of a typical wart and have little trouble recognizing it. Unusual warts with smooth surfaces or flat warts in children may be more difficult for parents to recognize. Common warts tend to cause no discomfort unless they are in areas of repeated friction or pressure. Plantar warts, for example, can become extremely painful. Large numbers of plantar warts on the foot may cause difficulty walking or running. Some warts will disappear without treatment, although it can sometimes take a couple of years. Treated or not, warts that go away often reappear. All warts can spread from one part of your own body to another. Unsightly or painful warts can be treated. Warts around and under your nails are much more difficult to cure than warts in other places."
1495,Who is at highest risk for Wart ?,"Warts can happen to anyone. However, some populations are more likely to get warts after exposure to HPV. At-risk groups include:
Children Young adults Elderly people People with compromised immune systems (such as HIV / AIDS positive individuals or organ transplant recipients)"
1496,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Wart ?,"Call for an appointment with your doctor if:
There are signs of infection (red streaking, pus, discharge, or fever) or bleeding. Warts can bleed a little, but if bleeding is significant or not easily stopped by light pressure, see a doctor. The wart does not respond to self-care and you want it removed. You have pain associated with the wart. You have anal or genital warts. You have diabetes or a weakened immune system (for example, HIV) and have developed warts. There is any change in the color or appearance of the wart."
1497,What to expect if I have Wart  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Warts are generally harmless growths that often go away on their own within 2 years. They can be contagious, but transmission from person to person is uncommon. Warts may be unsightly or cause discomfort, especially on the feet."
1498,What are the Symptoms of Yersinia Pestis Infection?,"Plague symptoms depend on how the patient was exposed to the plague bacteria. The plague can take different clinical forms, but the most common are bubonic, pneumonic and septicemic.
Symptoms appear suddenly, usually after 2 - 5 days of exposure to the bacteria, and may include:
Sudden onset of fever Malaise Headache Chills Weakness Muscle pain Seizures One or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes (called buboes):
Commonly found in the groin, but may occur in the armpits or neck, most often at the site of the infection (bite or scratch) Pain may occur in the area before the swelling appears
Symptoms appear suddenly, typically 2 - 3 days after exposure, and may include:
Fever Headache Weakness Rapidly developing pneumonia, with:
Shortness of breath Chest pain Cough Bloody or watery mucous
This type may cause death even before its symptoms occur. Symptoms may include:
Fever Chills Nausea Vomiting Extreme weakness Abdominal pain Bleeding into the skin and other organs (due to blood clotting problems) Diarrhea Necrosis of tissues, such as fingers, toes and nose"
1499,What Causes Yersinia Pestis Infection?,"Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis. Rodents, such as rats, carry the disease. It is spread by their fleas.
The plague bacteria can be transmitted to humans by the following ways:
Flea bites
Plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics, many rodents die, causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primary bubonic plague or septicemic plague.
Contact with contaminated fluids or tissues
Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague - infected animal.
Infectious droplets
When a person has plague pneumonia, they may cough droplets containing the plague bacteria into the air. If these bacteria -containing droplets are breathed in by another person, they can cause pneumonic plague. Typically this requires direct and close contact with the person with pneumonic plague. Transmission of these droplets is the only way that plague can spread between people.
This type of spread has not been documented in the United States since 1924, but still occurs with some frequency in developing countries. Cats are particularly susceptible to plague and can be infected by eating infected rodents. Sick cats pose a risk of transmitting infectious plague droplets to their owners or to veterinarians. Several cases of human plague have occurred in the United States in recent decades as a result of contact with infected cats.
In the Middle Ages in Europe, massive plague epidemics killed millions of people. Plague can still be found in Africa, Asia, and South America. Today, plague is rare in the United States, but it has been known to occur in parts of California, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico.
The three most common forms of plague are:
Bubonic plague -- an infection of the lymph nodes Pneumonic plague -- an infection of the lungs Septicemic plague -- an infection of the blood
The time between infection and development of symptoms is typically 2 to 7 days, but may be as short as 1 day for pneumonic plague. Risk factors for plague include a recent flea bite and exposure to rodents, especially rabbits, squirrels, or prairie dogs, or scratches or bites from infected domestic cats."
1500,Who is at highest risk for Yersinia pestis infection ?,"Human plague occurs in areas where the bacteria are present in wild rodent populations. The risks are generally highest in rural and semi-rural areas, including homes that provide food and shelter for various ground squirrels, chipmunks and wood rats, or other areas where you may encounter rodents.
People can get the plague when they are bitten by a flea that carries the plague bacteria from an infected rodent. People with highest risk of infection include:
People who handle infected animals People are usually more at risk during, or shortly after, a plague epizootic People that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague, because of the risk of being bitten by an infected flea People who have cats that have the plague"
1501,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Yersinia pestis infection ?,"People who should seek urgent medical care include:
Anyone who develops plague symptoms after exposure to fleas or rodents, especially if he/she lives in or has visited an area where plague occurs Anyone who lives or has recently traveled to the western U.S. or any other plague endemic area and has symptoms suggestive of plague
People in close contact with very sick pneumonic plague patients may be evaluated and possibly placed under observation. Preventive antibiotic therapy may also be given, depending on the type and timing of personal contact."
1502,Where to Find Medical Care for Yersinia Pestis Infection?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Yersinia pestis infection
1503,What to expect if I have Yersinia pestis infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, about 50% of people with bubonic plague die. Almost all people with pneumonic plague die if not treated. Treatment reduces the mortality rates to 8-10%."
1504,What are the symptoms of Zika virus infection?,"You can become infected with Zika virus more than once and show symptoms many times. Symptoms usually occur within hours or a few days after you are infected with Zika virus. It usually takes a couple of days (usually up to a week) before you are better. Symptoms of Zika virus infection include:
Fever Rash Loss of appetite Joint aches and/or muscle aches Vomiting Diarrhea or constipation Back pain Fatigue Red eye (conjunctivitis) and eye pain Muscle aches"
1505,What causes Zika virus infection?,"The virus that causes Zika virus infection is Zika virus (ZIKV). Zika virus is usually found in developing countries and is usually implicated outbreaks after people travel to endemic areas. Zika viruses are usually transmitted to humans via a mosquito bite, from the Aedes mosquito. However, Zika virus may also be transmitted from humans to other humans by exchanging body fluids, which often occurs during sexual intercourse or after blood transfusion."
1506,Does Zika virus infection cause Guillan-Barre syndrome?,"An association has been established between Guillan-Barre syndrome (GBS) and Zika virus infection. It is difficult to determine if any particular pathogen or germ “causes” Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The Brazil Ministry of Health has reported an increased number of people who have been infected with Zika virus who also have GBS. CDC is working with Brazil to study the possibility of a link between Zika and GBS. Zika outbreak in Colombia has been linked with confirmed GBS cases, hence supporting the idea that Zika Virus is associated with GBS."
1507,"If infected with Zika, how long should one wait before getting pregnant?","Once infected with Zika and the infection is cleared, there is currently no evidence showing that any future pregnancies are at risk. However, the CDC has provided the following guideline for family planning if you or your partner have been infected with Zika:
Read the CDC infographic on pregnancy and birth defects objectives here"
1508,What are the symptoms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency?,"In 21-hydroxylase, newborns develop severe symptoms shortly after birth due to loss of salt.
Dehydration and weight loss Vomiting Cardiac arrhythmias Electrolyte imbalance
Girls will usually have normal internal female reproductive organs as normal girls. But some of their external appearance may change. Boys won't have any obvious problems at birth. However, they may have 3-4 years early virilizing characteristics than normal boys.
Irregular or absent menstruation in girls Ambiguous genitalia or virilizing characteristics in girls, often appearing more male than female: Deep voice, early appearance of pubic and armpit hair, excessive hair growth and facial hair Early appearance of masculine characteristics in boys: Deep voice, early appearance of pubic and armpit hair, enlarged penis, small testes, well-developed muscles Rapid growth during childhood, but shorter than average final height Infertility Low bone density"
1509,What causes 21-hydroxylase deficiency?,Mutations in the CYP21A2 gene cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
1510,Who is at risk for 21-hydroxylase deficiency?,Family history of 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the risk factor for this disease.
1511,When to seek urgent medical care when I have 21-hydroxylase deficiency ?,"Contact your doctor if your child has signs and symptoms that seem to suggest 21-hydroxylase deficiency. For the women who may carry the mutate gene, you need to talk with your doctor, obtain appropriate information about the condition and the risk of having an affected child, and to decide on whether to have children."
1512,What to expect if I have 21-hydroxylase deficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency are usually good. But when adrenal crisis happens and is untreated, the patient may die within 1-6 weeks after birth."
1513,How do I know if I have 5-alpha-reductase deficiency and what are the symptoms?,"Infancy: Some patients with 5-alpha reductase deficiency may show female external genitalia. Some may appear male external genitalia. Others show with ambiguous genitalia. Puberty: Patients raised as girls often appear virilisation, such as amenorrhoea, hirsuitism, deepening of the voice, descending of the testes, enlarged clitoris or microphallus, and the urethra attaching to the phallus. Adulthood: In adulthood, lack of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), patients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency may not appear virilisation and experience male-pattern baldness."
1514,Who is at risk for 5-alpha-reductase deficiency?,"Researchs demonatrate that mutations in the SRD5A2 gene cause 5-alpha reductase deficiency. As a result of SRD5A2 mutations, the body cannot effectively convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which plays an important role in the formation of external genitalia before birth."
1515,How to know you have 5-alpha-reductase deficiency?,"Testosterone -to- dihydrotestosterone (T/DHT) level: In patients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, the testosterone level is normal or modestly elevated, whereas the DHT level is much low. Then, testosterone-to-dihydrotestosterone (T/DHT) level may be increased. Mutation analysis of the 5-alpha-reductase type 2 gene: It is primarily a research tool and not commercially available at present. Urinary ratios of various metabolites: These are also not commercially available currently. Pelvis ultrasonography: This is an painless test which uses sound waves to create a picture of the internal organs. For patients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, pelvis ultrasonography may be for differential diagnosis. Vaginogram: In patients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, vaginogram may be used to measure vaginal length and show no fistulous connections between the urinary tract and vagina."
1516,When to seek urgent medical care when I have 5-alpha-reductase deficiency ?,"Call your health care provider as soon as possible if your kid has symptoms of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, such as a kid shows ambiguous genitalia, or a girl often appears virilisation, or a boy does not appear virilisation."
1517,What to expect if I have 5-alpha-reductase deficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most affected males are unable to father a child. Osteoporosis and psychosexual dysfunction are usual complicatrions of patients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency.
1518,What are the symptoms of ABO incompatibility?,"The following are symptoms of transfusion reactions:
Back pain Blood in urine Feeling of ""impending doom"" Fever Yellow skin (jaundice)"
1519,What causes ABO incompatibility?,"A, B, and O are the three major blood types. The types are based on small substances (molecules) on the surface of the blood cells. In people who have different blood types, these molecules act as immune system triggers (antigens).
Each person has a combination of two of these surface molecules. Type O lacks any molecule. The different blood types are:
Type A (AA or AO molecules) Type B (BB or BO molecules) Type AB Type O
People who have one blood type form proteins (antibodies) that cause their immune system to react against other blood types. Being exposed to another type of blood can cause a reaction. This is important when a patient needs to receive blood (transfusion) or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be matched to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction. For example:
A patient with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood A patient with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood A patient with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood
Because type O lacks any surface molecules, type O blood does not cause an immune response. This is why type O blood cells can be given to patients of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. However, people with type O can only receive type O blood.
Since antibodies are in the liquid part of blood (plasma), both blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction."
1520,When to seek urgent medical care when I have ABO incompatibility ?,Call your health care provider if you have recently had a blood transfusion or transplant and you have the symptoms listed above.
1521,What to expect if I have ABO incompatibility  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"This can be a very serious problem which can even result in death. With the right treatment, a full recovery is likely."
1522,What are the symptoms of Abscess?,"Symptoms of an abscess depend largely on where the abscess forms. Some common symptoms include:
Pain at the site of the abscess Chills Fever Decreased function in the affected part of the body General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling Headache Local swelling, hardening of tissue Loss of appetite Loss of sensation in the affected area Nausea and vomiting Swelling"
1523,What causes Abscess?,"Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight it. White blood cells move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect within the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances. Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances.Abscesses in the skin are easy to see. They are red, raised, and painful. Abscesses in other areas of the body may not be obvious, but they may cause significant organ damage. Some specific type of abscesses are:
Abdominal abscess Amebic liver abscess Anorectal abscess Bartholin's abscess Brain abscess Epidural abscess Peritonsillar abscess Pyogenic liver abscess Skin abscess Spinal cord abscess Subcutaneous abscess Tooth abscess"
1524,Who is at highest risk for Abscess ?,People with recent history of infection are at increased risk for abscess.
1525,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Abscess ?,Call your health care provider if you think that you may have any type of abscess.
1526,What to expect if I have Abscess  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis depends on site of infection, type of organisms causing it and the patient profile(age, immunity status, comorbidities)"
1527,What are the symptoms of achalasia?,"Backflow (regurgitation) of food Chest pain, which may increase after eating or may radiate to the back, neck, and arms Cough Difficulty swallowing liquids and solids Heartburn Unintentional weight loss"
1528,What are the causes of achalasia?,"The main problem in achalasia is a failure of the a muscular ring where the esophagus and stomach come together (lower esophageal sphincter) to relax during swallowing.
Another part of the disorder is a lack of nerve stimulation to the muscles of the esophagus. Causes include:
Cancers Damage to the nerves of the esophagus Infection with a parasite Inherited factors
As a result, the wave-like contractions of smooth muscles that normally force food through the esophagus and other parts of the digestive tract do not work as well. (These contractions are called peristalsis.)
Achalasia is a rare disorder. It may occur at any age, but is most common in middle-aged or older adults."
1529,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Achalasia ?,"Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing or painful swallowing, or if your symptoms continue despite treatment for achalasia."
1530,What to expect if I have Achalasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcomes of surgery and nonsurgical treatments are similar. Sometimes more than one treatment is necessary.
1531,What are the symptoms of Achlorhydria?,"Patients with achlorhyria may have signs and symptoms as the following:
Impaired digestion or indigestion, undigested food in stools Nausea Bloating Diarrhea or constipation Increased susceptibility to bacterial and parasitic infection in stomach Iron deficiency Cracked nails
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
1532,What causes Achlorhydria?,"This condition may occur spontaneously as a result of a clinical disorder or from drug administration (iatrogenic). Studies demonstrate that prior gastric bypass surgery, chronic gastric H pylori infection, chronic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, or some autoimmune conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease may be associated with achlorhydria."
1533,Who is at highest risk for Achlorhydria ?,"Prior gastric bypass surgery Chronic gastric H pylori infection Chronic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use Autoimmune conditions, such as diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease. Elderly individuals"
1534,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Achlorhydria ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of achlorhydria develop.
1535,What to expect if I have Achlorhydria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome of achlorhydria depends on:
The underlying cause of achlorhydria: If achlorhydria results from cancer or a surgical procedure, the prognosis is more guarded. The complications of achlorhydria: Atrophic gastritis, one of the complications of achlorhydria, has been considered to be a potential precursor to gastric carcinoma."
1536,What are the symptoms of Acinic cell carcinoma?,"Early acinic cell carcinoma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
A mass or lump in your face, neck, or mouth Persistent pain A newly noticed difference between the size and/or shape of the left and right sides of your face or neck Numbness in part of your face New weakness of the muscles on one side of your face Swallowing problem
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
1537,Who is at highest risk for Acinic cell carcinoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of acinic cell carcinoma is related to several factors.
Radiation exposure: Radiation treatment for the head and neck cancer increases the risk of developing salivary gland cancer. Workplace exposure to certain radioactive substances may also increase the risk of salivary gland cancer. Family history: Some epidemiological data suggest that members of some families seem to have a higher than usual risk of developing salivary gland cancers."
1538,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acinic cell carcinoma ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of acinic cell carcinoma develop.
1539,What to expect if I have Acinic cell carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of acinic cell carcinoma depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the salivary gland The patient’s general health"
1540,What are the symptoms of Acoustic neuroma?,"Signs and symptoms of acoustic neuroma are often appear gradually and take some years to be apparent. They are not usually causes by tumor itself, although the signs and symptoms are the consequences of the tumor size and its pressure on its surrounding structures. As the tumor becomes larger in size, its pressure on nerves (facial, trigeminal and vestibular), nearby blood vessels, or other brain structure may cause more considerable or serious signs and symptoms.
Common signs and symptoms of acoustic neuroma include:
Hearing loss, often gradually - although in some cases occurs suddenly - and occurring on only one side or more pronounced on one side Ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear Unsteadiness, loss of balance Dizziness (vertigo) Facial numbness Weakness or loss of facial muscle movement"
1541,What causes Acoustic neuroma?,"Acoustic neuroma seems to be a genetic disease that means it’s existance came from malfunctioning of a specific gene on chromosome 22. Naturally, this gene produces some proteins to regulate Schwann cell, covering nerves growth but due to some unknown reasons this gene become corrupted and its function as a Schwann cell growth regulator disturbed so they can grow uncontrollably and form a tumor. This gene malfunctioning can also come from a rarely genetical disease called Neurofibromatosis type II, that is responsible for two sided tumor."
1542,Who is at highest risk for Acoustic neuroma ?,"As mentioned, Neurofibromatosis type II is a well-known reason of this disease, although it is responsible for only 5% of cases. Recent studies demonstrate an elevated risk of acoustic neuroma amongst individuals with the history of leisure noise exposure, but not regular occupational exposure; and a lower risk among ever and current cigarette smoker than never smokers without any correlation for ex-smokers."
1543,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acoustic neuroma ?,"You should seek medical care once each of the following symptoms are seen;
Hearing loss on one ear Ringing in one ear Balance disturbances"
1544,What to expect if I have Acoustic neuroma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acoustic neuromas are not malignant and do not metastasis (spread) to other Organs. However, some untreated or even relapsed tumor can grow rapidly and invade surrounding structure such as nerves, ear and brain tissue, especially brain stem which is life-treating. Even after adequate treatment by surgery or radiation some complications such as hearing loss and balance problems caused by tumor may be persistent. The least permanent complication are seen when the tumor discovered in its primary stages when its really small therefore its more likely to preserve hearing."
1545,What are the symptoms of Acromegaly?,"The name acromegaly comes from the Greek words for “extremities” and “enlargement,” reflecting one of its most common symptoms—the abnormal growth of the hands and feet. Swelling of the hands and feet is often an early feature, with patients noticing a change in ring or shoe size, particularly shoe width. Gradually, bone changes alter the patient’s facial features: The brow and lower jaw protrude, the nasal bone enlarges, and the teeth space out. Overgrowth of bone and cartilage often leads to arthritis. When tissue thickens, it may trap nerves, causing carpal tunnel syndrome, which results in numbness and weakness of the hands. Body organs, including the heart, may enlarge. Other symptoms of acromegaly include
joint aches thick, coarse, oily skin skin tags enlarged lips, nose, and tongue deepening of the voice due to enlarged sinuses and vocal cords sleep apnea—breaks in breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the airway excessive sweating and skin odor fatigue and weakness headaches impaired vision abnormalities of the menstrual cycle and sometimes breast discharge in women erectile dysfunction in men decreased libido"
1546,What are the causes of Acromegaly?,"Acromegaly is caused by prolonged overproduction of GH by the pituitary gland. The pituitary produces several important hormones that control body functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and metabolism. But hormones never seem to act simply and directly. They usually “cascade” or flow in a series, affecting each other’s production or release into the bloodstream. GH is part of a cascade of hormones that, as the name implies, regulates the physical growth of the body. This cascade begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus makes hormones that regulate the pituitary. One of the hormones in the GH series, or “axis,” is growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce GH. Secretion of GH by the pituitary into the bloodstream stimulates the liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is what actually causes tissue growth in the body. High levels of IGF-I, in turn, signal the pituitary to reduce GH production. The hypothalamus makes another hormone called somatostatin, which inhibits GH production and release. Normally, GHRH, somatostatin, GH, and IGF-I levels in the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and blood sugar levels. If the pituitary continues to make GH independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms, the level of IGF-I continues to rise, leading to bone overgrowth and organ enlargement. High levels of IGF-I also cause changes in glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism and can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.
In more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called an adenoma, produces excess GH. Pituitary tumors are labeled either micro- or macro-adenomas, depending on their size. Most GH-secreting tumors are macro-adenomas, meaning they are larger than 1 centimeter. Depending on their location, these larger tumors may compress surrounding brain structures. For example, a tumor growing upward may affect the optic chiasm—where the optic nerves cross—leading to visual problems and vision loss. If the tumor grows to the side, it may enter an area of the brain called the cavernous sinus where there are many nerves, potentially damaging them. Compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones. These hormonal shifts can lead to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and erectile dysfunction in men. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the thyroid—another hormone-producing gland—then thyroid hormones may decrease. Too little thyroid hormone can cause weight gain, fatigue, and hair and skin changes. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the adrenal gland, the hormone cortisol may decrease. Too little cortisol can cause weight loss, dizziness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea. Some GH-secreting tumors may also secrete too much of other pituitary hormones. For example, they may produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. Rarely, adenomas may produce thyroid-stimulating hormone. Doctors should assess all pituitary hormones in people with acromegaly. Rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor vary greatly among people with adenomas. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow more rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the venous sinuses, which are located near the pituitary gland. Younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors. Regardless of size, these tumors are always benign. Most pituitary tumors develop spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. They are the result of a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell, which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth, but happens later in life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells. It permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete GH. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.
Rarely, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain. These tumors also lead to excess GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH, the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. When these non-pituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.
In patients with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Physicians should carefully analyze all “pituitary tumors” removed from patients with acromegaly so they do not overlook the rare possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder."
1547,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acromegaly ?,You should talk to your doctor if you experience anything of the symptoms associated with Acromegaly
1548,What to expect if I have Acromegaly  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Pituitary surgery is successful in most patients, depending on the size of the tumor and the experience of the surgeon. Without treatment the symptoms will get worse, and the risk of cardiovascular disease increases."
1549,What are the symptoms of Acute brachial neuritis?,"Numbness of the shoulder, arm, or hand Shoulder pain Tingling, burning, pain, or abnormal sensations (location depends on the area injured) Weakness of the shoulder, arm, hand, or wrist"
1550,What causes Acute brachial neuritis?,"Acute brachial neuritis is a form of peripheral neuropathy. It occurs when there is damage to the brachial plexus, an area where a nerve bundle from the spinal cord splits into the individual arm nerves.
Damage to the brachial plexus is usually related to direct injury to the nerve, stretching injuries (including birth trauma), pressure from tumors in the area, or damage that results from radiation therapy.
Acute brachial neuritis may also be associated with:
Birth defects that put pressure on the neck area Exposure to toxins, chemicals, or drugs Inflammatory conditions, such as those due to a virus or immune system problem In some cases, no cause can be identified."
1551,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute brachial neuritis ?,"Call your health care provider if you experience pain, numbness, tingling or weakness in the shoulder, arm, or hand."
1552,What to expect if I have Acute brachial neuritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The likely outcome depends on the cause. A good recovery is possible if the cause is identified and properly treatment. In some cases, there may be a partial or complete loss of movement or sensation. Nerve pain may be severe and may persist for a long time."
1553,What are the symptoms of Acute bronchitis?,"The symptoms of either type of bronchitis may include: chest discomfort; cough that produces mucus (if it's yellow-green, you are more likely to have a bacterial infection); fatigue; fever (usually low); shortness of breath (dyspnea) worsened by exertion or mild activity; wheezing. Additionally, bronchitis caused by Adenoviridae may cause systemic and gastrointestinal symptoms as well. Even after acute bronchitis has cleared, you may have a dry, nagging cough that lingers for several weeks."
1554,What causes Acute bronchitis?,"Acute bronchitis can be caused by contagious pathogens. Acute bronchitis generally follows a viral respiratory infection. Typical viruses include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza, and others. At first, it affects your nose, sinuses, and throat and then spreads to the lungs. Sometimes, you may get another (secondary) bacterial infection in the airways. This means that bacteria infect the airways, in addition to the virus.
The following things can make bronchitis worse: air pollution; allergies; certain occupations (such as coal mining, textile manufacturing, or grain handling); infections."
1555,Who is at highest risk for Acute bronchitis ?,"People at risk for acute bronchitis include: the elderly, infants, and young children; persons with heart or lung disease; smokers."
1556,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute bronchitis ?,"Call your doctor if:
You have a cough most days or you have a cough that returns frequently You are coughing up blood You have a high fever or shaking chills You have a low-grade fever for 3 or more days You have thick, greenish mucus, especially if it has a bad smell You feel short of breath or have chest pain You have an underlying chronic illness, like heart or lung disease"
1557,What to expect if I have Acute bronchitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"For acute bronchitis, symptoms usually go away within 7 to 10 days if you do not have an underlying lung disorder. It may accompany or closely follow a cold or the flu, or may occur on its own. Bronchitis usually begins with a dry cough, including waking the sufferer at night. After a few days it progresses to a wetter or productive cough, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, and headache. The fever, fatigue, and malaise may last only a few days; but the wet cough may last up to several weeks.
Should the cough last longer than a month, some doctors may issue a referral to an otorhinolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor) to see if a condition other than bronchitis is causing the irritation. It is possible that having irritated bronchial tubes for as long as a few months may inspire asthmatic conditions in some patients.
In addition, if one starts coughing mucus tinged with blood, one should see a doctor. In rare cases, doctors may conduct tests to see if the cause is a serious condition such as tuberculosis or lung cancer."
1558,What are the symptoms of leukemia?,"Like all blood cells, leukemia cells travel through the body. The symptoms of leukemia depend on the number of leukemia cells and where these cells collect in the body.
People with chronic leukemia may not have symptoms. The doctor may find the disease during a routine blood test.
People with acute leukemia usually go to their doctor because they feel sick. If the brain is affected, they may have headaches, vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, or seizures. Leukemia also can affect other parts of the body such as the digestive tract, kidneys, lungs, heart, or testes.
Common symptoms of chronic or acute leukemia may include:
-Swollen lymph nodes that usually don't hurt (especially lymph nodes in the neck or armpit)
- Fever or night sweat
-Frequent infections
-Feeling weak or tired
- Bleeding and bruising easily (bleeding gums, purplish patches in the skin, or tiny red spots under the skin)
-Swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from a swollen spleen or liver)
- Weight loss for no known reason
- Pain in the bones or joints"
1559,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute myeloid leukemia ?,"If you have leukemia, and have received chemotherapy, you may develop a fever that may reflect the fact that your blood counts are low and you should seek medical care for antibiotics."
1560,Where to get Medical Care for leukemia?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Leukemia
1561,What to Expect (Outook/Prognosis)?,"Leukemia is a very serious disease which can have many complications. Complications can come from the disease itself and the treatments. Acute leukemia has a much quicker and more dramatic onset, but can sometimes be cured. Chronic Leukiemia has a slower onset and can often be put off for years. However, chronic leukemia is very rarely cured."
1562,What are the symptoms of Acute pancreatitis?,"Abdominal pain that is greatest in the upper abdomen (upper left quadrant or upper middle of the abdomen) Is persistent or chronic May be worse lying flat on the back. May spread (radiate) to the back or below the left shoulder blade. May be worse after eating or drinking (occurs within minutes following meals), especially foods with a high fat content. May be worse after drinking alcohol. Anxiety Fever Mild jaundice Nausea and vomiting Sweating
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Indigestion Clay-colored stools Gaseous abdominal fullness Hiccups Skin rash or lesion Swollen abdomen
Diseases with similar symptoms include:
Gallstones Pancreatic cysts Pseudocysts Chronic pancreatitis"
1563,What are the causes of Acute pancreatitis?,"The main causes of acute pancreatitis in adults are:
Alcohol use Gallbladder (biliary) disease Gallstones
Other causes include:
Certain medications (especially estrogens, corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, and azathioprine) Common bile duct surgical procedures Surgery to the pancreas Traumatic injury Viral infection (mumps, coxsackie B, mycoplasma pneumonia, and campylobacter)
Acute pancreatitis may also be caused by:
An abnormal structure of the pancreas Complications of cystic fibrosis Genetic factors (hereditary pancreatitis) High lipid levels in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia)
What exactly causes pancreatitis is not well known. It is thought that enzymes the pancreas normally releases in an inactive form become activated inside the pancreas and start to digest the pancreatic tissue. This process is called autodigestion. It causes swelling, bleeding (hemorrhage), and damage to the blood vessels.
In children, this disorder may be associated with:
Abdominal trauma Cystic fibrosis Hemolytic uremic syndrome Kawasaki disease Mumps Reye syndrome Some medications Various viral illnesses"
1564,Who is at highest risk for Acute pancreatitis ?,The disease affects men more often than women. Alcohol abuse is an important risk factor.
1565,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute pancreatitis ?,"Call your provider if:
You have intense, constant abdominal pain You develop other symptoms of acute pancreatitis"
1566,What to expect if I have Acute pancreatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases go away in a week. However, some cases develop into a life-threatening illness.
The death rate is high with:
Hemorrhagic pancreatitis Liver, heart, or kidney impairment Necrotizing pancreatitis
It is common for the condition to return."
1567,What are the symptoms of Acuteretinalnecrosis?,"It's important to recognize the symptoms of Acute retinal necrosis and seek medical help if you are experiencing the following:
Eye pain Redness in the eye Vision problems Partial or total vision Loss Excessive sensitivity to bright light Seeing spots when the affected eye is closed Experiencing flu -like symptoms in conjunction with the above"
1568,What causes Acuteretinalnecrosis?,"Acute retinal necrosis is caused by viral infections by the following:
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 & 2 Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Epstein-Barr (EPB) infection"
1569,Who is at highest risk for Acute retinal necrosis ?,"Acute retinal necrosis most often affects those with weakened immune systems, including those suffering from HIV, Diabetes, Chickenpox, Shingles, and Mono. This is particularly the case for those with diseases from the same viruses responsible for Acute retinal necrosis.
Individuals over the age of 50 are most at risk for Acute retinal necrosis from HSV-1, while individuals under the age of 25 are at highest risk for Acute retinal necrosis from HSV-2."
1570,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute retinal necrosis ?,"You should seek urgent medical care if you are experiencing the following:
Severe eye pain Vision loss to any extent Fluid leak from the affected eye"
1571,What to expect if I have Acute retinal necrosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, Acute retinal necrosis can lead to dangerous complications that can be life-threatening, including brain inflammation and meningitis. Permanent partial or total vision loss is likely without treatment due to the erosion and detachment of the retina of the eye. With treatment, there is a much greater chance of preserving eyesight and preventing life-threatening complications.
There is presently no guaranteed cure to reverse the symptoms; prognosis is improved the earlier the disease is diagnosed and treated with antiviral medication."
1572,What are the symptoms of Common cold?,"Cold symptoms usually occur within 2-3 days after you came in contact with the virus, although it could take up to a week. Symptoms mostly affect the nose.
The most common cold symptoms are as followings:
Nasal congestion Runny nose Scratchy throat Sneezing
Adults and older children with colds generally have a low grade fever or no fever. However, young children often run a fever around 100-102°F.
Depending on the virus that caused your cold, you may also have the followings:
Cough Decreased appetite Headache Muscle aches Postnasal drip Sore throat"
1573,What causes Common cold?,"It is called “ common cold ” for good reason. There are over one billion colds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have colds more than any other types of illness. Colds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children. Children typically get up to eight colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares. Colds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons.
A cold virus would being spread through tiny air droplets, released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose.
You can catch a cold if:
A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you. You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.
The disease is most contagious for the first 2-3 days; however, not contagious after the first week."
1574,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute viral nasopharyngitis ?,"Try to treat your cold at home first. Call your doctor if:
Breathing becomes difficult. Your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 7-10 days."
1575,What to expect if I have Acute viral nasopharyngitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The discharge of your runny nose will become thicker, may turn to yellow or green within a few days. This is normal, and not a reason for using antibiotics. Most cold symptoms usually go away within a week. If you still feel sick after 7 days, see your doctor to rule out conditions include: sinus infection, allergies, or other medical problems."
1576,Who is at highest risk for Acute viral nasopharyngitis ?,"Common cold can effect people of all age, gender, and ethnic group."
1577,What are the symptoms of Addison's disease?,"The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency usually begin gradually. Characteristics of the disease are:
Chronic, worsening fatigue Muscle weakness Loss of appetite Weight loss
About 50 percent of the time, one will notice other symptoms such as:
Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea
Other symptoms may be included:
Low blood pressure that falls further when standing, causing dizziness or fainting Skin changes in Addison's disease, with areas of hyperpigmentation, or dark tanning, covering exposed and nonexposed parts of the body; this darkening of the skin is most visible on scars; skin folds; pressure points such as the elbows, knees, knuckles, and toes; lips; and mucous membranes
Addison's disease can cause irritability and depression. Because of salt loss, a craving for salty foods also is common. Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, is more severe in children than in adults. In women, menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Because the symptoms progress slowly, they are usually ignored until a stressful event like an illness or an accident causes them to become worse. This is called an Addisonian crisis, or acute adrenal insufficiency. In most cases, symptoms are severe enough that patients seek medical treatment before a crisis occurs. However, in about 25 percent of patients, symptoms first appear during an addisonian crisis.
Symptoms of an addisonian crisis include;
Sudden penetrating pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs Severe vomiting and diarrhea Dehydration Low blood pressure Loss of consciousness
If left untreated, an addisonian crisis can be fatal."
1578,What causes Addison's disease?,"Failure to produce adequate levels of cortisol can occur for different reasons. The problem may be due to a disorder of the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency) or to inadequate secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency).
Addison's disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people. Most cases are caused by the gradual destruction of the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, by the body's own immune system. About 70 percent of reported cases of Addison's disease are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own tissues or organs and slowly destroy them. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. As a result, often both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldostertone) hormones are lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal gland is affected, as in idiopathic adrenal insufficiency; sometimes other glands also are affected, as in the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome.
The polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into two separate forms, referred to as type I and type II. Type I occurs in children, and adrenal insufficiency may be accompanied by:
Underactive parathyroid glands Slow sexual development Pernicious anemia Chronic Candida infections Chronic active hepatitis Hair loss (in very rare cases)
Type II, often called Schmidt's syndrome, usually afflicts young adults. Features of type II may include:
An underactive thyroid gland Slow sexual development Diabetes Vitiligo Loss of pigment on areas of the skin
Scientists think that the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is inherited because frequently more than one family member tends to have one or more endocrine deficiencies.
Tuberculosis (TB), an infection which can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for about 20 percent of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries. When adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was found at autopsy in 70 to 90 percent of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, however, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands has greatly decreased.
Less common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are
Chronic infection, mainly fungal infections Cancer cells spreading from other parts of the body to the adrenal glands Amyloidosis Surgical removal of the adrenal glands
This form of adrenal insufficiency is much more common than primary adrenal insufficiency and can be traced to a lack of ACTH. Without ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, the adrenal glands' production of cortisol drops, but not aldosterone. A temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been receiving a glucocorticoid hormone such as prednisone for a long time abruptly stops or interrupts taking the medication. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are often used to treat inflammatory illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or ulcerative colitis, block the release of both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Normally, CRH instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH. If CRH levels drop, the pituitary is not stimulated to release ACTH, and the adrenals then fail to secrete sufficient levels of cortisol. Another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the surgical removal of benign, or noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease). In this case, the source of ACTH is suddenly removed, and replacement hormone must be taken until normal ACTH and cortisol production resumes. Less commonly, adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from:
Tumors or infections of the area Loss of blood flow to the pituitary Radiation for the treatment of pituitary tumors Surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus Surgical removal of the pituitary gland"
1579,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Addison%27s disease ?,"It is important to seek medical care if you show signs of any of the symptoms associated with Addison's disease. This is especially important if you experience any of the symptoms of addisonian crisis, as this can be fatal if not treated immediately."
1580,What to expect if I have Addison%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If you don't treat Addison's disease, it can be fatal. You will need to take hormone pills for the rest of your life. If you have Addison's disease, you should carry an emergency ID. It should say that you have the disease, list your medicines and say how much you need in an emergency.
As long as the proper dose of replacement medication is taken every day, an Addisonian can have a normal crisis-free life. There are no specific physical or occupational restrictions. Routine care includes regular physician visits, avoidance of dehydration, and the use of extra medication during illness. Pregnancy is possible, but will require extra monitoring of the replacement medication. Every Addisonian should wear an identification bracelet or preferably a necklace stating that he or she has the disease, to insure proper emergency treatment. An identification card outlining treatment is also suggested."
1581,What are the symptoms of Adenocarcinoma of the lung?,"Common symptoms of adenocarcinoma of the lung include shortness of breath, blood in the sputum, chronic coughing, chest pain, weight loss, and change of voice."
1582,What causes Adenocarcinoma of the lung?,Adenocarcinoma of the lung may caused by genetic mutations.

1584,What to expect if I have Adenocarcinoma of the lung  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung varies with the staging of tumor; Stage IA have the most favorable prognosis. The presence of metastasis is associated with a particularly poor prognosis.
1585,What are the symptoms of Adenoma?,"Symptoms of adenomas vary widely. It depends on the size, the location of the adenomas.
For example, a small breast adenoma may cause no symptoms and may be unable to detect it. Other biger breast adenomas may cause pain. A lung adenoma can cause fever, chill, shortness of breath, and a bloody cough. A liver adenomas may cause abdonial pain, dyspepsia ， nausea, lump in the upper abdomen and abdominal distension."
1586,What causes Adenoma?,"The causes of adenoma are not clear. But heredity and environment may be related to the development of adenoma. For example, studies suggest that person with the family history of colon adenomas has more chance to get the disease than others without famliy history."
1587,Who is at highest risk for Adenoma ?,Women who use oral contraceptives may be at increased risk of developing liver adenomas.
1588,What to expect if I have Adenoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Benign tumors usually don't grow back.
1589,What are the symptoms of Adjustment disorder?,"For a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, a person's symptoms must be severe enough to affect his or her work or social life. Some of the symptoms include:
Agitation Conduct disturbances Depressed mood Palpitations Physical complaints Trembling or twitching
Symptoms of adjustment disorder typically begin within 3 months of the stressor, and usually do not last longer than 6 months, unless the stressor continues to be present (such as an illness or living in a dangerous neighborhood).
On occasion, symptoms can be severe and the person may have thoughts of suicide or make a suicide attempt."
1590,What causes Adjustment disorder?,"Adults often develop adjustment disorder due to marital or financial problems.
In adolescents, common stressors include:
Family conflict School problems Sexuality issues
Other stressors for people of any age include:
Death of a loved one General life changes Unexpected catastrophes
There is no way to predict which people who are affected by the same stress are likely to develop adjustment disorder. Financial conditions, social support, and career and recreational opportunities can influence how well a person reacts to stress.
A person's susceptibility to stress may be influenced by factors such as:
Coping strategies Intelligence Flexibility Genetic factors Social skills"
1591,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Adjustment disorder ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of adjustment disorder.
1592,What to expect if I have Adjustment disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Adjustment disorders usually get better quickly without any remaining symptoms.
1593,What are the symptoms of Adrenal tumor?,Every disease has different symptoms.
1594,What are the symptoms of Adrenocortical carcinoma ?,"Symptoms that suggest increased cortisol or other adrenal gland hormone production:
Fatty, rounded hump high on the back just below the neck (buffalo hump) Flushed rounded face with pudgy cheeks (moon face) Obesity Stunted growth in height (short stature) Virilization - the appearance of male characteristics, including increased body hair (especially on the face), pubic hair, acne, deepening of voice, and enlarged clitoris (girls)
Symptoms that suggest increased aldosterone production are the same as symptoms of low potassium and include:
Increased thirst Muscle cramps Urination Weakness"
1595,What causes Adrenocortical carcinoma ?,"Adrenocortical carcinoma is most common in children younger than 5 and adults in their 30s and 40s.
Adrenocortical carcinoma may be linked to a cancer syndrome that is passed down through families (inherited). Both men and women can develop this tumor.
Adrenocortical carcinoma can produce the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, or testosterone, as well as other hormones. In women the tumor often releases these hormones, which can lead to male characteristics.
The cause is unknown. About 2 people per million develop this type of tumor."
1596,When to contact a Medical Professional ?,"Call your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma, Cushing syndrome, or failure to grow."
1597,What to expect if I have Adrenocortical carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on how early the diagnosis is made and whether the tumor has spread (metastasized). Tumors that have spread usually lead to death within 1 to 3 years.
1598,What are the symptoms of Adrenoleukodystrophy?,"Childhood cerebral type:
Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and spasticity Crossed eyes (strabismus) Decreased understanding of verbal communication (aphasia) Deterioration of handwriting Difficulty at school Difficulty understanding spoken material Hearing loss Hyperactivity Worsening nervous system deterioration Coma Decreased fine motor control Paralysis Seizures Swallowing difficulties Visual impairment or blindness
Adrenomyelopathy:
Difficulty controlling urination Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness Problems with thinking speed and visual memory
Adrenal gland failure (Addison type):
Coma Decreased appetite Increased skin color (pigmentation) Loss of weight, muscle mass (wasting) Muscle weakness Vomiting"
1599,What causes Adrenoleukodystrophy?,"Adrenoleukodystrophy is passed down from parents to their children as an X-linked genetic trait. It therefore affects mostly males, although some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects approximately 1 in 20,000 people from all races.
The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes, which disrupts normal activity. There are three major categories of disease:
Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 - 8) Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones"
1600,Who is at highest risk for Adrenoleukodystrophy ?,"Adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic disorder, so anyone with a family history of the disorder is at risk. Since the disease is passed down from parents to their children as an X-linked genetic trait, males are mostly affected."
1601,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Adrenoleukodystrophy ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse"
1602,What to expect if I have Adrenoleukodystrophy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease that leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after neurological symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs.
The other forms of this disease are milder."
1603,What are the symptoms of Agoraphobia?,"Agoraphobia is considered to be present when places or situations are being avoided.
People with agoraphobia generally do not feel safe in public places. Their fear is worse when the place is crowded.
Symptoms of agoraphobia include:
Becoming housebound for prolonged periods of time Dependence on others Fear of being alone Fear of being in places where escape might be difficult Fear of losing control in a public place Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others Feelings of helplessness Feeling that the body is unreal Feeling that the environment is unreal Unusual temper or agitation"
1604,What causes Agoraphobia?,"The exact causes of panic disorder and agoraphobia are unknown.
Agoraphobia sometimes occurs when a person has had a panic attack and begins to fear situations that might lead to another panic attack."
1605,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Agoraphobia ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of agoraphobia.
1606,What to expect if I have Agoraphobia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most patients can get better with medications or behavioral therapy. However, without early and effective help, the disorder may become more difficult to treat."
1607,What are the symptoms of Agranulocytosis?,Persons with this condition are more likely to have fevers and infections.
1608,What causes Agranulocytosis?,"Agranulocytosis may be caused by:
Autoimmune disorders Bone marrow diseases such as myelodysplasia or large granular lymphocyte leukemia Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation Medications such as rituximab, penicillin, captopril, ranitidine, cimetidine, methimazole, and propylthiouracil Preparation for bone marrow transplant
Agranulocytosis results in a person not having enough of a specific type of white blood cells, called neutrophils or granulocytes. A low neutrophil count (neutropenia) may also occur when white blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be produced."
1609,What are the symptoms of AIDS?,"The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of infections that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy immune systems. These are called opportunistic infections. People with AIDS have had their immune system weakened by HIV and are very susceptible to these opportunistic infections. Some people with HIV infection remain without symptoms for years between the time the are exposed to the virus and when they develop AIDS. Initial infections can present sometimes with Flu like symptoms.
Fevers
Sweats (particularly at night),
Swollen glands, chills, weakness
Weight loss
Sore throat
Diarrhea
Mouth sores including yeast infections."
1610,What causes AIDS?,"Anyone can get HIV. The most important thing to know is how you can get the virus. You can get HIV:
By having unprotected sex- sex without a condom- with someone who has HIV. The virus can be in an infected person’s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions and can enter your body through tiny cuts or sores in your skin, or in the lining of your vagina, penis, rectum, or mouth. By sharing a needle and syringe to inject drugs or sharing drug equipment used to prepare drugs for injection with someone who has HIV. From a blood transfusion or blood clotting factor that you got before 1985. (But today it is unlikely you could get infected that way because all blood in the United States has been tested for HIV since 1985.) Babies born to women with HIV also can become infected during pregnancy, birth, or breast-feeding.
You cannot get HIV:
By working with or being around someone who has HIV. From sweat, spit, tears, clothes, drinking fountains, phones, toilet seats, or through everyday things like sharing a meal. From insect bites or stings. From donating blood. From a closed-mouth kiss (but there is a very small chance of getting it from open-mouthed or ""French"" kissing with an infected person because of possible blood contact)."
1611,Who is at highest risk for AIDS ?,"Persons who are practicing unsafe sexual behavior(unprotected), drug addicts. Sexual partners of those who engage in high risk behavior like anal sex and share needle for drug use. Children born to HIV positive mothers are at increased risks for developing the disease People who received blood transfusion or clotting products between 1977 to 1985 as screening for HIV was not s standard test at that time"
1612,When to seek urgent medical care when I have AIDS ?,"Since HIV weakens the immune system, people with AIDS should consult a doctor and get tested if they believe they have it. If you are diagnosed with AIDS, you should be in constant contact with your doctor. People with AIDS are susceptible to infections and cancers that most healthy adults would not get and so they must be very aware of any new diseases which their bodies acquire, and report them to their physicians as they occur."
1613,What to expect if I have AIDS  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Right now, there is no cure for AIDS. It is always fatal if no treatment is provided. In the US, most patients survive many years after diagnosis because of the availability of medicines such as HAART. HAART and medicines like it have dramatically increased the amount of time people with HIV remain alive.
Research continues in the areas of drug treatments and vaccine development. Unfortunately, HIV medications are not always available in the developing world, where the bulk of cases now occur."
1614,What are the symptoms of AIDS dementia complex?,Confusion Forgetfulness Behavioral changes Headaches Progressive weakness Loss of sensation in the arms and legs Cognitive motor impairment or damage to the peripheral nerves is also common
1615,What causes AIDS dementia complex?,"In the United States, neurological complications are seen in more than 50 percent of adults with AIDS.
The virus does not appear to directly invade nerve cells but it jeopardizes their health and function. The resulting inflammation may damage the brain and spinal cord and cause symptoms.
Research has shown that the HIV infection can significantly alter the size of certain brain structures involved in learning and information processing.
Milder cognitive complaints are common and are termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)."
1616,What to expect if I have AIDS dementia complex  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When left untreated, AIDS dementia complex can be fatal."
1617,What are the symptoms of Alcoholic hepatitis?,Symptoms of Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from mild to severe. The symptoms include: Nausea Malaise Low-grade fever Abdominal Pain Yellow discoloration of skin Increased abdominal girth due to Ascites Gastrointestinal bleeding due to variceal hemorrhage Lack of appetite Confusion Lethargy
1618,What causes Alcoholic hepatitis?,Alcoholic Hepatitis is suspected to occur in patients with excessive drinking over the decades.
1619,Who is at highest risk for Alcoholic hepatitis ?,Alcoholic Hepatitis can also occur after short period of drinking 100 g alcohol daily. Heavy drinking is considered as drinking ≥15 drinks/week in men and ≥8 drinks/week in women. Binge drinking is defined as consumption of ≥5 drinks in men and ≥ four drinks in women in 2 hours. Consumption of > 3 drinks (approximately 40 g) per day in women and 4 drinks (approximately 60 g) per day in men is considered as threshold for Alcoholic hepatitis
1620,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alcoholic hepatitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis You develop symptoms after prolonged or heavy drinking You are concerned that drinking may be damaging your health"
1621,What to expect if I have Alcoholic hepatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Alcohol abstinence improves your prognosis. However, The outcome will likely be poor if you keep drinking."
1622,What are the symptoms of Alcoholic liver disease?,"Changes start in the liver as inflammation (hepatitis) and lead to fatty liver and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the final phase of alcoholic liver disease.
Symptoms may not be present until the disease is advanced, and may include:
Abdominal pain and tenderness Dry mouth Excessive thirst Fatigue Fever Fluid collection in the abdomen (ascites) Jaundice Loss of appetite Mental confusion Nausea Unintentional weight gain (because of fluid collection)
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Abnormally dark or light skin Agitation Bloody, dark black, or tarry bowel movements (melena) Breast development in males Changing mood Confusion (encephalopathy)
Changed level of consciousness Hallucinations Impaired short- or long-term memory
Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit) Impaired ability to concentrate Impaired judgment Light-headedness or fainting, especially when standing Paleness Rapid heart rate (tachycardia) when rising to standing position Redness on feet or hands Slow, sluggish, lethargic movement Vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds
Symptoms vary based on the severity of the disease. They are usually worse after a recent period of heavy drinking."
1623,What are the causes of Alcoholic liver disease?,"Alcoholic liver disease usually occurs after years of excessive drinking. The longer the alcohol use and the more alcohol that was consumed, the greater the likelihood of developing liver disease.
Acute alcoholic hepatitis can result from binge drinking. It may be life-threatening if severe.
People who drink excessively can become malnourished because of the empty calories from alcohol, reduced appetite, and poor absorption (malabsorption) of nutrients in the intestines. Malnutrition contributes to liver disease.
Other factors that contribute to the development of alcoholic liver disease:
Genetic factors Personal susceptibility to alcohol-induced liver disease Toxicity of alcohol (ethanol) to the liver
Alcoholic liver disease does not affect all heavy drinkers. Women may be more susceptible than men. It is not necessary to get drunk for the disease to develop."
1624,Who is at highest risk for Alcoholic liver disease ?,"Risk Factors include:
Heavy drinking/Binge drinking Gender: Women are more susceptible than men Genetic predisposition Personal susceptibility to alcohol-induced liver disease Toxicity of alcohol (ethanol) to the liver"
1625,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alcoholic liver disease ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of alcoholic liver disease You develop symptoms after prolonged or heavy drinking You are concerned that drinking may be damaging your health"
1626,What to expect if I have Alcoholic liver disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Continued excessive drinking can shorten your lifespan. The outcome will likely be poor if you keep drinking.
1627,What are the symptoms of Alkaptonuria?,"Urine in an infant's diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours. However, many persons with this condition may not know they have it until mid-adulthood (around age 40), when joint and other problems occur.
Symptoms may include:
Arthritis (especially of the spine) that gets worse over time Darkening of the ear Dark spots on the white of the eye (sclera) and cornea"
1628,What causes Alkaptonuria?,"A defect in the HGD gene causes alkaptonuria.
The gene defect makes the body unable to properly break down certain amino acids (tyrosine and phenylalanine). As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and other body tissues. The acid leaves the body through the urine. The urine turns brownish-black when it mixes with air.
Alkaptonuria is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to their children. To get this disease, each of your parents must pass you a copy of the faulty HGD gene."
1629,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alkaptonuria ?,Call your health care provider if you notice that your own urine or your child's urine becomes dark brown or black when it is exposed to air.
1630,What to expect if I have Alkaptonuria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome for people affected with alkaptonuria is generally expected to be good. Some possible complications include people with this condition also can get arthritis in adulthood. The build-up of homogentisic acid in the cartilage causes arthritis in about 50% of older adults with alkaptonuria.
Homogentisic acid also can build up on the heart valves, especially the mitral valve. This can sometimes lead to the need for valve replacement. Coronary artery disease may develop earlier in people with alkaptonuria. Kidney stones and prostate stones may be more common in people with alkaptonuria."
1631,What are the symptoms of Allergic conjunctivitis?,"Symptoms may be seasonal and can include:
Intense itching or burning eyes Puffy eyelids, especially in the morning Red eyes Stringy eye discharge Tearing (watery eyes) Widened (dilated) vessels in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye"
1632,What causes Allergic conjunctivitis?,"When your eyes are exposed to anything to which you are allergic, histamine is released and the blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen. Reddening of the eyes develops quickly, along with itching and tearing.
The pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny, hard-to-see pollens that may cause hay fever include:
Grasses Ragweed Trees The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether you develop symptoms. There is more likely to be increased amounts of pollen in the air on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground.
Allergies tend to run in families, although they are not inherited in any obvious way. It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies, because many different conditions are often lumped under the term allergy."
1633,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Allergic conjunctivitis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you experience allergic conjunctivitis and it does not respond to over-the-counter treatment.
1634,What to expect if I have Allergic conjunctivitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treatment often relieves symptoms, but they can return if you continue to be exposed to the allergen."
1635,What are the symptoms of Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency?,"Shortness of breath with and without exertion, and other symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Symptoms of severe liver disease (cirrhosis) Unintentional weight loss Wheezing"
1636,What causes Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency?,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a type of protein called a ""protease inhibitor."" It is made in the liver and it works to protect the lungs and liver.
AAT deficiency means there is not enough of this protein in the body. It is caused by a genetic defect. The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent.
Studies show that AAT deficiency may be more common than was once thought.
Adults with severe deficiency will develop emphysema, often before age 40. Smoking can increase the risk of emphysema. Other patients can have higher levels of AAT in their blood, and therefore have a less severe condition.
Persons with this deficiency may also develop liver disease."
1637,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of AAT deficiency.
1638,What to expect if I have Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some people with this deficiency will not develop liver or lung disease. However, emphysema and cirrhosis can be life threatening."
1639,What are the symptoms of Altitude sickness?,"Symptoms generally associated with mild to moderate altitude sickness include:
Difficulty sleeping Dizziness or light-headedness Fatigue Headache Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Rapid pulse (heart rate) Shortness of breath with exertion
Symptoms generally associated with more severe altitude sickness include:
Bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis) Chest tightness or congestion Confusion Cough Coughing up blood Decreased consciousness or withdrawal from social interaction Gray or pale complexion Inability to walk in a straight line, or to walk at all Shortness of breath at rest"
1640,What causes Altitude sickness?,"Altitude sickness is brought on by the combination of reduced air pressure and lower oxygen concentration that occur at high altitudes. Symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening, and can affect the nervous system, lungs, muscles, and heart.
In most cases the symptoms are mild. In severe cases fluid collects in the lungs (pulmonary edema) causing extreme shortness of breath. This further reduces how much oxygen enters the bloodstream and reaches vital organs and tissue. Brain swelling may also occur (cerebral edema). This can cause confusion, coma, and, if untreated, death.
Approximately 20% of people will develop mild symptoms at altitudes between 6,300 to 9,700 feet, but pulmonary and cerebral edema are extremely rare at these heights. However, above 14,000 feet, a majority of people will experience at least mild symptoms. Some people who stay at this height can develop pulmonary or cerebral edema."
1641,Who is at highest risk for Altitude sickness ?,"The chance of getting altitude sickness increases the faster a person climbs to a high altitude. How severe the symptoms are also depends on this factor, as well as how hard the person pushes (exerts) himself or herself. People who normally live at or near sea level are more prone to altitude sickness."
1642,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Altitude sickness ?,"Call your health care provider if you have or had symptoms of altitude sickness, even if you felt better when you returned to a lower altitude.
Call 911 or your local emergency number, or seek emergency medical assistance if severe difficulty breathing develops, or if you notice a lower level of consciousness, coughing up of blood, or other severe symptoms. If unable to contact emergency help, descend immediately, as rapidly as is safely possible."
1643,What to expect if I have Altitude sickness  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases are mild, and symptoms improve promptly with a return to lower altitude. Severe cases may result in death due to respiratory distress or brain swelling (cerebral edema).
In remote locations, emergency evacuation may not be possible, or treatment may be delayed. These conditions could adversely affect the outcome."
1644,What are the symptoms of Amblyopia?,"Amblyopia can often go undetected to the untrained observer. In fact, many people with amblyopia, especially those who are only mildly so, are not even aware they have the condition until tested at older ages since the vision in their stronger eye is normal. However, people with more severe amblyopia may experience associated visual disorders, most notably poor depth perception. Other symptoms include:
Eyes that turn in or out Eyes that do not appear to work together Poor spatial acuity Low sensitivity to contrast Problems of binocular vision: Limited depth perception Difficulty seeing the three-dimensional images in hidden stereoscopic displays such as autostereograms.  Some ""higher-level"" vision problems, such as reduced sensitivity to motion"
1645,What are the causes of Amblyopia?,"The brain and the eye work together to produce vision. Light enters the eye and is changed into nerve signals that travel along the optic nerve to the brain. Amblyopia is the medical term used when the vision in one of the eyes is reduced because the eye and the brain are not working together properly. The eye itself looks normal, but it is not being used normally because the brain is favoring the other eye. As a result, the affected eye fails to develop normal vision, and therefore has trouble seeing details. It has been estimated to affect 1–5% of the population. 
Amblyopia is caused primarily by one of two factors: improper alignment of the eyes (known as strabismus), or unequal refractive power. If the child's eyes are not properly aligned, the brain will receive two different images from the eyes. Perceiving double vision, the brain will not use the image from the weaker eye. This eye, through lack of use, gradually loses its ability to function.
The second primary cause of amblyopia is significantly unequal refractive power in the two eyes. For example, one eye may be very farsighted or nearsighted while the other eye may have normal vision. Again the brain receives different images from the two eyes and suppresses the image from the weaker eye.
Other causes of amblyopia include:
Family history of amblyopia Astigmatism in both eyes Childhood cataracts
Ambylopia can also occur physiologically after tobacco or alcohol consumption."
1646,Who is at highest risk for Amblyopia ?,"Those with a family history of amblyopia have an increased risk of the disorder. Additionally, young children with an astigmatism in both eyes, childhood cataracts, strabismus, and unequal refractive power are at increased risk of amblyopia. Ambylopia can also occur physiologically after tobacco or alcohol consumption."
1647,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Amblyopia ?,"Although not considered a medical emergency, amblyopia should be treated as early as possible. An ophthalmologist or optometrist should be seen if a vision problem is suspected in a young child so that proper treatment may begin before permanent vision loss occurs."
1648,What to expect if I have Amblyopia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Vision screening by age 4 can successfully detect reduced vision in one or both eyes resulting from amblyopia. Children who receive treatment before age 5 usually have a near complete recovery of normal vision.
Children will not outgrow either amblyopia or strabismus, so early examinations are essential. Delaying treatment can result in permanent vision problems. After age 10, only a partial recovery of vision can be expected. A child whose amblyopia or strabismus is left untreated will grow into an adult who has poor or little vision."
1649,What are the symptoms of amoebic liver abscess ?,"Symptoms of amoebic liver abscess include:
Abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper part of the abdomen; pain is intense, continuous or stabbing Cough Fever and chills Diarrhea (in only one-third of patients) General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) Hiccups that do not stop (rare) Jaundice Loss of appetite Sweating Weight loss"
1650,Who is at highest risk for amoebic liver abscess?,"The following increases your chances of developing amoebic liver abscess:
Alcoholism Cancer Immunosuppression, including HIV infection Malnutrition Old age Pregnancy Recent travel to a tropical region Steroid use"
1651,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Amoebic liver abscess ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of amoebic liver abscess, especially if you have recently traveled to an area where the disease is known to occur. You have amoebic liver abscess and the symptoms continue despite treatment."
1652,What are the symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?,"Symptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people.
Persons with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing.
Breathing or swallowing muscles may be the first muscles affected. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems.
ALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). It only rarely affects bladder or bowel function, or a person's ability to think or reason.
Symptoms include:
Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Choking easily Drooling Gagging Head drop due to weakness of the neck muscles Muscle cramps Muscle contractions called fasciculations Muscle weakness that slowly gets worse Commonly involves one part of the body first, such as the arm or hand Eventually leads to difficulty lifting, climbing stairs, and walking Paralysis Speech problems, such as a slow or abnormal speech pattern (slurring of words) Voice changes, hoarseness Weight loss"
1653,What causes Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?,"In about 10% of cases, ALS is caused by a genetic defect. In the remaining cases, the cause is unknown.
In ALS, nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body.
The condition slowly gets worse. When the muscles in the chest area stop working, it becomes hard or impossible to breathe on one's own.
ALS affects approximately 5 out of every 100,000 people worldwide."
1654,Who is at highest risk for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ?,"There are no known risk factors, except for having a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease."
1655,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of ALS, particularly if you have a family history of the disorder You or someone else has been diagnosed with ALS and symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop
Increased difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and episodes of apnea are symptoms that require immediate attention."
1656,What to expect if I have Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Over time, people with ALS progressively lose the ability to function and care for themselves. Death often occurs within 3 - 5 years of diagnosis. About 25% of patients survive for more than 5 years after diagnosis."
1657,What are the symptoms of Anal cancer?,"Early anal cancer does not make any symptoms. When the cancer grows larger, people with anal cancer may experience the following symptoms. Hemorrhoids or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
Bleeding from the anal area A change in bowel habits or change in the diameter of the stool Pain in the anal area or inferior belly Itching or discharge from the anus A lump or swelling near the anus"
1658,Who is at highest risk for Anal cancer ?,"Studies have found a number of factors that may increase the risk of anal cancer. In recent years, scientists point out that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of anal cancer. HPV infection and other risk factors may act together to increase the risk even more.
Human papillomavirus (HPV): Around the anus skin, some strains of HPV can cause venereal warts which is associated with anal cancer. HPV is often spread through sexual contact, particularly anal intercourse. Multiple sexual partners Anal sex Anal fistulas: presence of abnormal openings along the anal canal Weakened Immune System：Infection with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) or taking drugs that suppress the immune system increases the risk of anal cancer. Gender: Clinical data show women have a higher risk than men. Age: Like other digestive tract tumors, people occur in the age of 50 years or older. Cigarette smoking：Like some cancer, smoking also increases the risk of anal cancer."
1659,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anal cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of anal cancer develop. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain, severe abdominal distension, and stopping defecation: The reason of a person with anal cancer appears these symptoms is mostly because of intestinal obstruction caused by lumps. This is the results of lumps growth on rectum wall. A surgery will be done urgently. Defecation with a lot of blood: This is the result of cancer invading the vessels of rectum or anus walls. An abundant of blood loss may lead to shock and death. You need to go to hospital as soon as possible."
1660,What to expect if I have Anal cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of anal cancer varies widely. It depends on the following:
The size of the tumor Location of the tumor in the anus Whether the cancer has distant spread Whether the patient has Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Whether cancer remains after initial treatment or has recurred"
1661,What are the symptoms of an Anal fissure?,"Anal fissures may cause painful bowel movements and bleeding. There may be blood on the outside of the stool or on the toilet tissue (or baby wipes) following a bowel movement.
Other symptoms may include:
A crack in the skin that can be seen when the area is stretched slightly (the fissure is almost always in the middle) Constipation"
1662,What are the causes of an Anal fissure?,"Anal fissures are extremely common in young infants but may occur at any age. Studies suggest 80% of infants will have had an anal fissure by the end of the first year. The rate of anal fissures decreases rapidly with age. Fissures are much less common among school-aged children than infants.
In adults, fissures may be caused by constipation, the passing of large, hard stools, or by prolonged diarrhea. In older adults, anal fissures may be caused by decreased blood flow to the area.
Anal fissures are also common in women after childbirth and persons with Crohn's disease."
1663,Who is at highest risk for Anal fissure ?,"People who are most at risk for developing an anal fissure include:
Infants Elderly adults Women who just gave birth People with crohn's disease People who have trouble with constipation or chronic diarrhea"
1664,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anal fissure ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms associated with anal fissure are present, or if the fissure does not heal appropriately with treatment."
1665,What to expect if I have Anal fissure  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Anal fissures generally heal quickly without further problems. However, people who develop fissures are more likely to have them in the future."
1666,What are the symptoms of Androgen insensitivity syndrome?,"The typical characteristic of androgen insensitivity syndrome is feminization. It can be divided into two main categories: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and incomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome
At birth, because of external sex characteristics of females, this type of people are usually raised as females and have a female gender identity. During puberty, their female secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts develope. At the same time, they have sparse or absent hair in the pubic area and under the arms. They do not menstruate and testes are undescended. At adult, they are unable to conceive a child for without uterus. Undescended testes can become cancerous later in life if they are not surgically removed.
Incomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome
At birth, they may have normal female sex characteristics, both male and female sex characteristics, or normal male sex characteristics. They may be raised as males or as females, and may have a male or a female gender identity. During puberty, people with mild androgen insensitivity tend to experience female secondary sex characteristics, such as breast enlargement. Many of them have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina but no cervix or uterus. Their testes locate in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. In adult, they are often infertile."
1667,What Causes (disease name)?,"Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene have been shown to cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is characterized by complete or partial resistance to the biological effects of androgens in 46,XY karyotype individuals with normal testis determination and production of age-appropriate androgen concentrations.
AIS may be classified into mild (MAIS), partial (PAIS) or complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS), based on its phenotypic expression, which ranges from a male phenotype with isolated infertility, to ambiguous genitalia, to a completely female external phenotype."
1668,Who is at highest risk for Androgen insensitivity syndrome ?,"Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene is the cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome. This gene controls the making of a protein called androgen receptor. The mutative gene prevents androgen receptors from working properly. Thus, it makes cells less sensitive response to androgens or prevents cells from using these hormones at all. At last, it makes the body unable to respond to the hormones responsible for the male appearance."
1669,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Androgen insensitivity syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you or your child appears to have signs or symptoms of the syndrome.
1670,What to expect if I have Androgen insensitivity syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"For patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, prognosis is good after orchidectomy at the proper time. For incomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome patients, it depends on the presence and severity of ambiguous genitalia."
1671,What are the symptoms of Anemia?,"Possible symptoms include:
Chest pain Dizziness or light-headedness (especially when standing up or with activity) Fatigue or lack of energy Headaches Problems concentrating Shortness of breath (especially during exercise)
Some types of anemia may have other symptoms, such as:
Constipation Problems thinking Tingling"
1672,What causes Anemia?,"While many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form blood cells.
Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.
Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their red color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin.
Possible causes of anemia include:
Certain medications Chronic diseases such as cancer, ulcerative colitis, or rheumatoid arthritis Genetis: Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia, can be inherited Kidney failure Blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers) Poor diet Pregnancy Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma Problems with the immune system that cause the destruction of blood cells (hemolytic anemia) Surgery to the stomach or intestines that reduces the absorption of iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid Too little thyroid hormone (underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism) Testosterone deficiency"
1673,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anemia ?,"Call your health provider if you have any symptoms of anemia, or any unusual bleeding."
1674,What to expect if I have Anemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outlook depends on the cause.
1675,What are the symptoms of anemia of prematurity?,"Symptoms of anemia of prematurity include one or more of the following:
Pale skin Lethargy Decreased activity Difficulty breathing Rapid heart rate Poor weight gain Feeding difficulties"
1676,What causes anemia of prematurity?,Preterm birth Blood loss during phlebotomy for laboratory investigations
1677,Who is at highest risk for Anemia of prematurity ?,Premature infants Extremely low birth weight infants
1678,What to expect if I have Anemia of prematurity  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With prompt diagnosis and early treatment, symptoms resolve without any complications in infants with anemia of prematurity. If left untreated, anemia of prematurity leads to serious complications"
1679,What are the symptoms of Anencephaly?,"Symptoms of anencephaly may include:
Missing bones, especially in the front/sides of the skull Folded cartilage of the ears Cleft palate Congenital heart disease Absence of the bone that covers the back of the head Blindness Deafness Unconsciousness Inability to feel pain
Although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a rudimentary brain stem, the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules out the possibility of ever gaining consciousness. Reflex actions such as breathing and responses to sound or touch may occur."
1680,Who is at highest risk for Anencephaly ?,"The cause of anencephaly is unknown. Although it is thought that a mother's diet and vitamin intake may play a role, scientists believe that many other factors are also involved. Most cases of anencephaly are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of cases have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. For parents who have had a child with anencephaly, the risk of having another affected child is increased compared to the risk in the general population."
1681,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anencephaly ?,"Genetic counseling is recommended for expectant parents with a history of other genetic disorders that may influence the potential for anencephaly. Miscarriage is common in expectant mothers with an anencephalic fetus, seek immediate medical attention if you believe you are experiencing a miscarriage."
1682,What to expect if I have Anencephaly  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis for babies born with anencephaly is extremely poor. If the infant is not stillborn, then he or she will usually die within a few hours or days after birth.
Anencephaly is one of the most common types of neural tube defect, affecting about 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. However, most of these pregnancies end in miscarriage, so the prevalence of this condition in newborns is much lower. An estimated 1 in 10,000 infants in the United States is born with anencephaly."
1683,What are the symptoms of Ankylosing spondylitis?,"Early signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis may limit in your back and hip. When the disease develops, other organs may be involved.
Chronic pain in your lower back and hips, stiffness in your lower back or hip area, especially in the morning and after periods of inactivity. As disease progresses, your symptoms get worse and you may feel pain and stiffness over time. Joint pain Joint swelling Stiff, inflexible spine Eye inflammation or uveitis Restricted expansion of your chest Low fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Weight loss"
1684,What causes Ankylosing spondylitis?,"The cause of ankylosing spondylitis is unknown, but genes seem to play a role.
The disease most often begins between ages 20 and 40 but may begin before age 10. It affects more males than females. Risk factors include:
Family history of ankylosing spondylitis Male gender"
1685,Who is at highest risk for Ankylosing spondylitis ?,"The cause of ankylosing spondylitis is not clear. Researches demonstrate the following factors may be associated with this disease.
Heredity: Almost 90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis are born with the HLA-B27 gene. Recent data demonstrate gene ARTS1 and IL23R are associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Gender: Male Age: 10~40 years old."
1686,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ankylosing spondylitis ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis develop.
1687,What to expect if I have Ankylosing spondylitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of ankylosing spondylitis varies from person to person. Most patients can maintain a good function. Wwhile other patients may lose daily functions. Prognosis depends on:
Onset age: The early onset age, the worse prognosis will be. Whether organs outside joints are affected. Whether the patient is treated in time. Whether the patient is got physical therapy."
1688,What are the symptoms of Annular pancreas?,"Symptoms of annular pancreas include:
Feeding intolerance in newborns Fullness after eating Nausea and vomiting"
1689,What causes Annular pancreas?,"Annular pancreas is caused by malformation during the development of the pancreas, before birth. This condition may result in a narrowing of the duodenum due to squeezing by the ring of pancreas.
Complete obstruction of the duodenum is often seen in newborns with this condition. However, half of cases are not diagnosed until symptoms occur in adulthood. There are probably many cases that go undetected due to mild symptoms.
People with this condition are more like to have a peptic ulcer."
1690,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Annular pancreas ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you or your child have any symptoms of annular pancreas.
1691,What to expect if I have Annular pancreas  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome is usually good with surgery.
1692,What are the symptoms of Antisocial personality disorder?,"A person with antisocial personality disorder may:
Be able to act witty and charming Be good at flattery and manipulating other people's emotions Break the law repeatedly Disregard the safety of self and others Have problems with substance abuse Lie, steal, and fight often Not show guilt or remorse Often be angry or arrogant"
1693,What causes Antisocial personality disorder?,"The causes of antisocial personality disorder are unknown. Genetic factors and child abuse are believed to contribute to the development of this condition. People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are at increased risk. Far more men than women are affected. The condition is common in people who are in prison.
Fire-setting and cruelty to animals during childhood are linked to the development of antisocial personality.
Some people believe that psychopathic personality (psychopathy) is the same disorder. Others believe that psychopathic personality is a similar but more severe disorder."
1694,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Antisocial personality disorder ?,"Call for an appointment with a mental health professional if:
You have symptoms of antisocial personality disorder Your child shows behaviors of this disorder"
1695,What to expect if I have Antisocial personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Symptoms tend to peak during the late teenage years and early 20s. They sometimes improve on their own by a person's 40s.
1696,What are the types of Aphasia?,"1. Wernicke’s aphasia: Damage to the temporal lobe (the side portion) of the brain may result in a fluent aphasia called Wernicke’s aphasia. In most people, the damage occurs in the left temporal lobe, although it can result from damage to the right lobe as well. People with Wernicke’s aphasia may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create made-up words. For example, someone with Wernicke’s aphasia may say, “You know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before.” As a result, it is often difficult to follow what the person is trying to say. People with Wernicke’s aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding speech, and they are often unaware of their mistakes. These individuals usually have no body weakness because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.
2. Broca’s aphasia: A type of non-fluent aphasia is Broca’s aphasia. People with Broca’s aphasia have damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. They frequently speak in short phrases that make sense but are produced with great effort. They often omit small words such as “is,” “and,” and “the.” For example, a person with Broca’s aphasia may say, “Walk dog,” meaning, “I will take the dog for a walk,” or “book book two table,” for “There are two books on the table.” People with Broca’s aphasia typically understand the speech of others fairly well. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated. People with Broca’s aphasia often have right-sided weakness or paralysis of the arm and leg because the frontal lobe is also important for motor movements.
3. Global aphasia: Another type of non-fluent aphasia, results from damage to extensive portions of the language areas of the brain. Individuals with global aphasia have severe communication difficulties and may be extremely limited in their ability to speak or comprehend language."
1697,What are the symptoms of Aphasia?,"Any of the following can be considered symptoms of aphasia:
inability to comprehend language inability to pronounce, not due to muscle paralysis or weakness inability to speak spontaneously inability to form words inability to name objects poor enunciation excessive creation and use of personal neologisms inability to repeat a phrase persistent repetition of phrases paraphasia (substituting letters, syllables or words) agrammatism (inability to speak in a grammatically correct fashion) dysprosody (alterations in inflexion, stress, and rhythm) uncompleted sentences inability to read inability to write"
1698,What causes Aphasia?,"Aphasia is caused by damage to one or more of the language areas of the brain. Many times, the cause of the brain injury is a stroke. A stroke occurs when blood is unable to reach a part of the brain. Brain cells die when they do not receive their normal supply of blood, which carries oxygen and important nutrients. Other causes of brain injury are severe blows to the head, brain tumors, brain infections, and other conditions that affect the brain."
1699,Who is at highest risk for Aphasia ?,"Anyone can acquire aphasia, including children, but most people who have aphasia are middle-aged or older. Men and women are equally affected. According to the National Aphasia Association, approximately 80,000 individuals acquire aphasia each year from strokes. About one million people in the United States currently have aphasia."
1700,What are the symptoms of Aphthous ulcer ?,"The first symptom is usually a tingling or burning sensation that you feel before other symptoms develop. The following symptoms may then occur:
Painful, red spot or bump that develops into an open ulcer Center is colored white or yellow Usually small (under 1 cm) but occasionally larger Single bump or group of bumps (crops) Sore may turn gray just before starting to heal
Less common symptoms include:
Fever General discomfort or uneasiness (malaise) Swollen lymph nodes
Pain decreases in 7 to 10 days, with complete healing in 1 to 3 weeks. Particularly large ulcers (greater than 1 cm in diameter) often take longer to heal (2 to 4 weeks). Occasionally, a severe occurrence may be accompanied by nonspecific symptoms of illness, such as fever. Canker sores often return."
1701,What are the causes of Aphthous ulcer ?,"Aphthous ulcers may be linked to problems with the body's immune (defense) system. The sores may occur after a mouth injury due to dental work, aggressive tooth cleaning, or biting the tongue or cheek. They can also be triggered by emotional stress, dietary deficiencies (especially iron, folic acid, or vitamin B-12), menstrual periods, hormonal changes, food allergies, and similar situations. They occur most commonly with viral infections. In some cases, the cause can not be identified."
1702,Who is at highest risk for Aphthous ulcer ?,"Aphthous ulcers are a common form of mouth ulcer. They occur in women more often than men. They may occur at any age, but usually first appear between the ages of 10 and 40. Aphthous ulcers can run in families."
1703,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Aphthous ulcer ?,"Apply home treatment and call your health care provider if symptoms of canker sores persist or worsen, or canker sores recur more often than 2 or 3 times per year. If you have a mouth ulcer that lasts more that 2 weeks, you should see your doctor to rule out possible cancer. Call your health care provider if symptoms are associated with other problems such as fever, diarrhea, headache, or skin rash."
1704,What to expect if I have Aphthous ulcer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Aphthous ulcers usually heal on their own. The pain usually decreases in a few days. Other symptoms disappear in 10 to 14 days.
1705,What are the symptoms of Appendicitis?,"Most people with appendicitis have classic symptoms that a doctor can easily identify. The main symptom of appendicitis is abdominal pain.
The abdominal pain usually:
Occurs suddenly, often causing a person to wake up at night Occurs before other symptoms Begins near the belly button and then moves lower and to the right Is new and unlike any pain felt before Gets worse in a matter of hours Gets worse when moving around, taking deep breaths, coughing, or sneezing
Other symptoms of Appendicitis may include:
Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Constipation or diarrhea Inability to pass gas Low-grade fever that follows other symptoms The feeling that passing stool will relieve discomfort
Symptoms vary and can mimic other sources of abdominal pain, including:
Intestinal obstruction Inflammatory bowel disease Pelvic inflammatory disease and other gynecological disorders Intestinal adhesions Constipation
Diseases with similar symptoms
According to age group:
Gastroenteritis Mesenteric adenitis Meckel's diverticulum Intussusception Henoch-Schõnlein purpura Lobar pneumonia
Regional enteritis Renal colic Perforated peptic ulcer Testicular torsion Pancreatitis Rectus sheath hematoma Pelvic inflammatory disease Ectopic pregnancy Endometriosis Torsion/rupture of ovarian cyst Ruptured Graafian follicle
Diverticulitis Intestinal obstruction Colonic carcinoma Mesenteric infarction Leaking aortic aneurysm."
1706,What causes Appendicitis?,"Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen causes appendicitis. Mucus backs up in the appendiceal lumen, causing bacteria that normally live inside the appendix to multiply. As a result, the appendix swells and becomes infected. Sources of obstruction include:
Feces, parasites, or growths that clog the appendiceal lumen. Enlarged lymph tissue in the wall of the appendix, caused by infection in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere in the body Inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis Trauma to the abdomen.
An inflamed appendix will likely burst if not removed. Bursting spreads infection throughout the abdomen—a potentially dangerous condition called peritonitis."
1707,Who is at highest risk for Appendicitis ?,"Anyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people 10 to 30 years old. Appendicitis leads to more emergency abdominal surgeries than any other cause."
1708,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Appendicitis ?,Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care. People who think they have appendicitis should see a doctor or go to the emergency room right away. Swift diagnosis and treatment reduce the chances the appendix will burst and improve recovery time.
1709,What to expect if I have Appendicitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most appendicitis patients recover easily with treatment, but complications can occur if treatment is delayed or if peritonitis occurs.
Recovery time depends on age, condition, complications, and other circumstances, including the amount of alcohol consumption, but usually is between 10 and 28 days. For young children (around 10 years old) the recovery takes three weeks.
The real possibility of life-threatening peritonitis is the reason why acute appendicitis warrants speedy evaluation and treatment. The patient may have to undergo a medical evacuation. Appendectomies have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e. outside of a proper hospital), when a timely medical evaluation was impossible.
Typical acute appendicitis responds quickly to appendectomy and occasionally will resolve spontaneously. If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis. Atypical appendicitis (associated with suppurative appendicitis) is more difficult to diagnose and is more apt to be complicated even when operated early. In either condition prompt diagnosis and appendectomy yield the best results with full recovery in two to four weeks usually. Mortality and severe complications are unusual but do occur, especially if peritonitis persists and is untreated."
1710,What are the symptoms of Arthritis?,"The pattern and location of symptoms can vary depending on the type of arthritis. Generally, people with arthritis feel pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The onset of arthritis symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly. Arthritis is most often a chronic disease, so symptoms may come and go, or persist over time."
1711,What causes Arthritis?,"Arthritis involves the breakdown of cartilage. Cartilage normally protects a joint, allowing it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones rub together, causing pain, swelling (inflammation), and stiffness.
Joint inflammation may result from:
An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue) Broken bone General ""wear and tear"" on joints Infection, usually by the bacteria or virus
Usually the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated. Sometimes it does not. When this happens, you have chronic arthritis. Arthritis may occur in men or women. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. See: Osteoarthritis
Other, more common types of arthritis include:
Ankylosing spondylitis Gonococcal arthritis Gout Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (in children) Other bacterial infections (nongonococcal bacterial arthritis) Psoriatic arthritis Reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome) Rheumatoid arthritis (in adults) Scleroderma Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)"
1712,Who is at highest risk for Arthritis ?,"Certain factors are associated with a greater risk of arthritis. Some of these risk factors are modifiable while others are not. Non-modifiable risk factors:
Age: The risk of developing most types of arthritis increases with age. Gender: Most types of arthritis are more common in women; 60% of the people with arthritis are women. Gout is more common in men. Genetic: Specific genes are associated with a higher risk of certain types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ankylosing spondylitis.
Modifiable risk factors
Overweight and Obesity: Excess weight can contribute to both the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis. Joint Injuries: Damage to a joint can contribute to the development of osteoarthritis in that joint. Infection: Many microbial agents can infect joints and potentially cause the development of various forms of arthritis. Occupation: Certain occupations involving repetitive knee bending and squatting are associated with osteoarthritis of the knee."
1713,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Arthritis ?,"If you have pain, stiffness, or swelling in or around one or more of your joints, talk to your doctor. It is important to keep in mind that there are many forms of arthritis, and a specific diagnosis of the type you have may help to direct the proper treatment. Although there is no cure for most types of arthritis, early diagnosis and appropriate management are important, especially for inflammatory types of arthritis. For example, early use of disease-modifying drugs can affect the course of rheumatoid arthritis. An early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can make a difference in pain and joint damage. The earlier you understand your arthritis, the earlier you can start managing your disease and making healthy lifestyle changes to help your arthritis."
1714,What to expect if I have Arthritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A few arthritis-related disorders can be completely cured with proper treatment.
Most forms of arthritis however are long-term (chronic) conditions."
1715,What are the symptoms of Ascariasis?,"Most of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include:
Bloody sputum Cough Low-grade fever Passing worms in stool Shortness of breath Skin rash Stomach pain Vomiting worms Wheezing Worms exiting through the nose or mouth"
1716,Who is at highest risk for Ascariasis ?,"Ascariasis is caused by consuming food or drink contaminated with roundworm eggs. Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is found in association with poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation, and in places where human feces are used as fertilizer.Once consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae within the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae then move through the bloodstream to the lungs, exit up through the large airways of the lungs, and are swallowed back into the stomach and reach the small intestine. During movement through the lungs the larvae may produce an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Once they are back in the small intestine, the larvae mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine where they lay eggs that are present in feces. They can live 10 – 24 months. It is estimated that 1 billion people are infected worldwide. Ascariasis occurs in people of all ages, though children are affected more severely than adults."
1717,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ascariasis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of ascariasis, particularly if you have traveled to a high-risk area. Also call if symptoms get worse, do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms occur."
1718,What to expect if I have Ascariasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most people recover from symptoms of the infection, even without treatment, although they may continue to carry the worms in their body. Complications may be caused by adult worms that move to certain organs such as the bile duct, pancreas, or appendix, or multiply and cause a blockage in the intestine."
1719,What are the symptoms of Asherman’s syndrome?,"The adhesions may cause amenorrhea (lack of menstrual periods), repeated miscarriages, and infertility.
However, such symptoms could be related to several conditions. They are more likely to indicate Asherman syndrome if they occur suddenly after a D&C or other uterine surgery."
1720,What causes Asherman’s syndrome?,"Asherman syndrome is a rare condition.
In most cases, it occurs in women who have had several dilatation and curettage procedures.
A severe pelvic infection unrelated to surgery may also lead to Asherman syndrome.
Intrauterine adhesions can also form after infection with tuberculosis or schistosomiasis. These infections are rare in the United States, and uterine complications such as Asherman syndrome related to these infections are even less common."
1721,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Asherman%27s syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if your menstrual periods do not resume after a gynecologic or obstetrical procedure.
An evaluation for infertility is also warranted if you are unable to achieve a pregnancy after 6 to 12 months of trying."
1722,What to expect if I have Asherman%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Asherman syndrome can be cured in most women with surgery, although sometimes more than one procedure will be necessary.
Women who are infertile because of Asherman syndrome may have a successful pregnancy after treatment.
Successful pregnancy depends on the severity of Asherman syndrome and the difficulty of the treatment, as well as other factors that affect fertility and pregnancy."
1723,What are the symptoms of Astigmatism?,"Astigmatism may cause symptoms such as   :
Blurry vision Squinting Asthenopia Fatigue Headaches Difficulty driving at night
It is possible to have mild astigmatism and not know about it. This is especially true for children, who are not aware of their vision being other than normal. Some adults may also have mild astigmatism without any symptoms. It's important to have comprehensive dilated eye exams to make sure you are seeing at your best."
1724,What are the causes of Astigmatism?,"The cause of astigmatism is unknown. It is usually present from birth, and often occurs together with nearsightedness or farsightedness. A minor degree of astigmatism is considered normal and does not require correction. Astigmatism is very common.
Astigmatism may sometimes develop due after eye surgery or following an eye injury . Additionally, severe astigmatism may result from a somewhat rare condition called keratoconus , which is a degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than its normal gradual curve."
1725,Who is at highest risk for Astigmatism (eye) ?,"Astigmatism can affect both children and adults. According to an American study published in Archives of Ophthalmology, nearly 3 in 10 children between the ages of 5 and 17 have astigmatism . Regarding the prevalence in adults, a recent study in Bangladesh found that nearly 1 in 3 (32.4%) of those over the age of 30 had astigmatism . A number of studies have found that the prevalence of astigmatism increases with age .
Some patients with slight astigmatism will not notice much change in their vision. It is important to have eye examinations at regular intervals in order to detect any astigmatism early on for children."
1726,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Astigmatism (eye) ?,"Call for an appointment with the health care provider or ophthalmologist if vision problems worsen, or do not improve with glasses or contact lenses."
1727,What to expect if I have Astigmatism (eye)  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook of those with an astigmatism is generally very good, provided that treatment is available. Vision is usually normal with the correct glasses or contact lenses."
1728,What are the Symptoms of Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma?,"Some common symptoms of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma include:
Headache Vomiting Nausea Blurred vision Seizure Change in personality/behavior Memory loss"
1729,What Causes Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma?,The exact cause of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is unknown but it is predominantly associated with tuberous sclerosis which is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes.
1730,Who is at highest risk for Astrocytoma ?,People with tuberous sclerosis have the highest risk of developing subependymal giant cell astrocytoma
1731,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Astrocytoma ?,"If acute symptoms such as headache, vomiting, confusion, and blurred vision should develop, or new onset of symptoms, seek urgent care immediately."
1732,What to expect if I have Astrocytoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis is generally poor. A few positive prognostic factors include:
Surgical treatment Age under 18 years"
1733,What are the symptoms of Atrophic vaginitis?,"Burning on urination Light bleeding after intercourse Painful sexual intercourse causing a loss in sexual interest Slight vaginal discharge Vaginal soreness, including itching or burning sensations"
1734,What causes Atrophic vaginitis?,"Atrophic vaginitis is caused by a decrease in estrogen. Estrogen levels normally drop after menopause.
Estrogen is very important in keeping the tissues of the vagina lubricated and healthy. Normally, the lining of the vagina makes a clear, lubricating fluid. This fluid makes sexual intercourse more comfortable and helps decrease vaginal irritation.Thinning or shrinking of the vaginal tissue causes dryness and inflammation.
The following may cause estrogen levels to drop and lead to atrophic vaginitis:
Medications or hormones used to decrease estrogen levels in women, as part of the treatment for breast cancer, endometriosis, fibroids, or infertility Radiation treatment to the pelvic area or chemotherapy Severe stress, depression, or rigorous exercise
Atrophic vaginitis may occur in younger women who have had surgery to remove their ovaries.
Some women develop the condition immediately after childbirth or while breastfeeding, since estrogen levels are lower at these times.
The vagina can also become further irritated from soaps, laundry detergents, lotions, perfumes, or douches. Certain medications, smoking, tampons, and condoms may also cause or worsen vaginal dryness."
1735,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atrophic vaginitis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are experiencing vaginal dryness or soreness, burning, itching, or painful sexual intercourse that is not alleviated with a water-soluble lubricant."
1736,What to expect if I have Atrophic vaginitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Proper treatment will usually relieve the symptoms.
1737,What are the symptoms of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"The symptoms of ADHD fall into three groups:
Lack of attention (inattentiveness) Hyperactivity Impulsive behavior (impulsivity)
Some children with ADHD primarily have the inattentive type. Others may have a combination of types. Those with the inattentive type are less disruptive and are more likely to not be diagnosed with ADHD.
Inattentive symptoms:
Fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork Has difficulty keeping attention during tasks or play Does not seem to listen when spoken to directly Does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace Has difficulty organizing tasks and activities Avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental effort (such as schoolwork) Often loses toys, assignments, pencils, books, or tools needed for tasks or activities Is easily distracted Is often forgetful in daily activities
Hyperactivity symptoms:
Fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat Leaves seat when remaining seated is expected Runs about or climbs in inappropriate situations Has difficulty playing quietly Is often ""on the go,"" acts as if ""driven by a motor,"" talks excessively
Impulsivity symptoms:
Blurts out answers before questions have been completed Has difficulty awaiting turn Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games)"
1738,What causes Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed behavioral disorder of childhood. It affects about 3 - 5% of school aged children. ADHD is diagnosed much more often in boys than in girls.
ADHD may run in families, but it is not clear exactly what causes it. Whatever the cause may be, it seems to be set in motion early in life as the brain is developing. Imaging studies suggest that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of other children.
Depression, lack of sleep, learning disabilities, tic disorders, and behavior problems may be confused with, or appear with, ADHD. Every child suspected of having ADHD should be carefully examined by a doctor to rule out possible other conditions or reasons for the behavior.
Most children with ADHD also have at least one other developmental or behavioral problem. They may also have a psychiatric problem, such as depression or bipolar disorder."
1739,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ?,"Call your doctor if you or your child's school personnel suspect ADHD. You should also tell your doctor about any:
Difficulties at home, school, and in relationships with peers Medication side effects Signs of depression"
1740,What to expect if I have Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"ADHD is a long-term, chronic condition. If it is not treated appropriately, ADHD may lead to:
Drug and alcohol abuse Failure in school Problems keeping a job Trouble with the law
About half of children with ADHD will continue to have troublesome symptoms of inattention or impulsivity as adults. However, adults are often more capable of controlling behavior and masking difficulties."
1741,What are the symptoms of Autism?,"Most parents of autistic children suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old and seek help by the time the child is age 2. Children with autism typically have difficulties in:
Pretend play Social interactions Verbal and nonverbal communication
Some children with autism appear normal before age 1 or 2 and then suddenly regress and lose language or social skills they had previously gained. This is called the regressive type of autism.
People with autism may:
Be overly sensitive in sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste (for example, they may refuse to wear ""itchy"" clothes and become distressed if they are forced to wear the clothes) Have unusual distress when routines are changed Perform repeated body movements Show unusual attachments to objects
The symptoms may vary from moderate to severe.
Communication problems may include:
Cannot start or maintain a social conversation Communicates with gestures instead of words Develops language slowly or not at all Does not adjust gaze to look at objects that others are looking at Does not refer to self correctly (for example, says ""you want water"" when the child means ""I want water"") Does not point to direct others' attention to objects (occurs in the first 14 months of life) Repeats words or memorized passages, such as commercials Uses nonsense rhyming
Social interaction:
Does not make friends Does not play interactive games Is withdrawn May not respond to eye contact or smiles, or may avoid eye contact May treat others as if they are objects Prefers to spend time alone, rather than with others Shows a lack of empathy
Response to sensory information:
Does not startle at loud noises Has heightened or low senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste May find normal noises painful and hold hands over ears May withdraw from physical contact because it is overstimulating or overwhelming Rubs surfaces, mouths or licks objects Seems to have a heightened or low response to pain
Play:
Doesn't imitate the actions of others Prefers solitary or ritualistic play Shows little pretend or imaginative play
Behaviors:
""Acts up"" with intense tantrums Gets stuck on a single topic or task (perseveration) Has a short attention span Has very narrow interests Is overactive or very passive Shows aggression to others or self Shows a strong need for sameness Uses repetitive body movements"
1742,What causes Autism?,"Autism is a physical condition linked to abnormal biology and chemistry in the brain. The exact causes of these abnormalities remain unknown, but this is a very active area of research. There are probably a combination of factors that lead to autism.
Genetic factors seem to be important. For example, identical twins are much more likely than fraternal twins or siblings to both have autism. Similarly, language abnormalities are more common in relatives of autistic children. Chromosomal abnormalities and other nervous system (neurological) problems are also more common in families with autism.
A number of other possible causes have been suspected, but not proven. They involve:
Diet Digestive tract changes Mercury poisoning The body's inability to properly use vitamins and minerals
Autism and Vaccines:
Many parents are worried that some vaccines are not safe and may harm their baby or young child. They may ask their doctor or nurse to wait, or even refuse to have the vaccine. However, it is important to also think about the risks of not having the vaccination.
Some people believe that the small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) that is a common preservative in multidose vaccines causes autism or ADHD. However, studies have NOT shown this risk to be true.
The American Academy of Pediatrics, and The Institute of Medicine (IOM) agree that no vaccine or component of any vaccine is responsible for the number of children who are currently being diagnosed with autism. They conclude that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks.
All of the routine childhood vaccines are available in single-dose forms that do not contain added mercury."
1743,How many children have Autism?,"The exact number of children with autism is not known.
A report released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that autism and related disorders are more common than previously thought. It is unclear whether this is due to an increasing rate of the illness or an increased ability to diagnose the illness.
Autism affects boys 3 - 4 times more often than girls. Family income, education, and lifestyle do not seem to affect the risk of autism.
Some doctors believe the increased incidence in autism is due to newer definitions of autism. The term ""autism"" now includes a wider spectrum of children. For example, a child who is diagnosed with high-functioning autism today may have been thought to simply be odd or strange 30 years ago."
1744,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Autism ?,"Parents usually suspect that there is a developmental problem long before a diagnosis is made.
Call your health care provider with any concerns about autism or if you think that your child is not developing normally."
1745,What to expect if I have Autism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Autism remains a challenging condition for children and their families, but the outlook today is much better than it was a generation ago. At that time, most people with autism were placed in institutions.
Today, with the right therapy, many of the symptoms of autism can be improved, though most people will have some symptoms throughout their lives. Most people with autism are able to live with their families or in the community.
The outlook depends on the severity of the autism and the level of therapy the person receives."
1746,What are the symptoms of Autoimmune hemolytic anemia?,"You may not have symptoms if the anemia is mild. If the problem develops slowly, symptoms that may occur first include:
Feeling grumpy Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise Headaches Problems concentrating or thinking
If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:
Blue color to the whites of the eyes Brittle nails Light-headedness when you stand up Pale skin color (pallor) Shortness of breath Sore tongue"
1747,What causes Autoimmune hemolytic anemia?,"Possible causes include:
Certain chemicals, drugs, and toxins Infections Transfusion of blood from a donor with a blood type that does not match Certain cancers
When antibodies form against red blood cells for no reason, the condition is called idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
The antibodies may also be caused by:
Complication of another disease Past blood transfusions Pregnancy (if the baby's blood type is different from the mother's)
Risk factors are related to the causes."
1748,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Autoimmune hemolytic anemia ?,"Call your healthcare provider if you have unexplained fatigue or chest pain, or signs of infection."
1749,What to expect if I have Autoimmune hemolytic anemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The disease may start quickly and be very serious, or it may stay mild and not need special treatment.
In most people, steroids or splenectomy can totally or partially control anemia."
1750,What are the symptoms of Autoimmune hepatitis?,"The most common symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are:
Fatigue Joint pain Nausea Loss of appetite Abdominal pain Skin Rashes Dark yellow urine Light-colored stools Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin
Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis range from mild to severe. Some people may feel as if they have a mild case of the flu. Others may have no symptoms when a health care provider diagnoses the disease; however, they can develop symptoms later."
1751,What are the causes of Autoimmune hepatitis ?,"A combination of autoimmunity, environmental triggers, and a genetic predisposition can lead to autoimmune hepatitis."
1752,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Autoimmune hepatitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis. You have autoimmune hepatitis and the symptoms continue despite treatment."
1753,What to expect if I have Autoimmune hepatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis is generally excellent, and the 10-year survival rate of patients with autoimmune hepatitis treated with immunosuppressive therapy is approximately 80%.  
Prognosis is poor without treatment, 50% of patients with severe autoimmune hepatitis will die in a 5 years. The presence of young age at presentation, AIH-2, coagulopathy, severe histologic activity is associated with a poor prognosis among patients with autoimmune hepatitis."
1754,What are the symptoms of Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome?,"Type I: fungal infections (chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis), thyroid issues (hypoparathyroidism), autoimmune adrenal insufficency, type 1 diabetes, reproductive issues (hypogonadism), anemia, malabsorption, baldness, and vitiligo
Symptoms may appear as young as five years old (specifically with candidiasis). Hypoparathyroidism commonly appears in people younger than 10 years. Autoimmune adrenal insufficency appears in people younger than 15 years.
Type II: autoimmune disease (Addison's disease), thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, reproductive issues (hypogonadism), digestive issues (Celiac disease) and neuromuscular disease (myasthenia gravis). Type III: digestive issues (Celiac disease and gastric carcinoid tumors), reproductive issues (hypogonadism), autoimmune disorders (sarcoidosis), and rheumatoid arthritis."
1755,Who is at highest risk for Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome ?,"Genetics play a role in the likelihood someone may have Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome.
Type I has been linked to a genetic defect in the 21st chromosome which influences immune tolerance. Type II patients are at a higher risk when they carry a particular HLA genotype. Type III has been linked to an X chromosome defect and is more common in males. Women, too, can be carriers and might suffer mildly from the disease."
1756,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if your child has persistent yeast infections, thyroid issues, reproductive issues, or digestive issues seem unusual for his or her age."
1757,What to expect if I have Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Type I: The prognosis of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I is variable, depending on how organs are affected and the severity of the disease.
Type II: Prognosis of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II depends on whether endocrine end-organ failures occur or not.
Type III: Prognosis of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type III depends on whether glandular failures occur or not."
1758,How is Avian influenza different in animals vs. humans?,"Avian influenza in birds: Avian influenza is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) viruses. These influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.
Human infection with avian influenza viruses: There are many different subtypes of type A influenza viruses. Usually, “avian influenza virus ” refers to influenza A viruses found chiefly in birds, but infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk from avian influenza is generally low to most people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans. However, confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza infection have been reported since 1997. Most cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (e.g., domesticated chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion / excretions from infected birds. The spread of avian influenza viruses from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and has been limited, inefficient and unsustained.
“Human influenza virus ” usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. There are only three known A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating among humans. Influenza A viruses are constantly changing, and they might adapt over time to infect and spread among humans.
During an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry, there is a possible risk to people who have contact with infected birds or surfaces that have been contaminated with secretions or excretions from infected birds."
1759,What are the symptoms of Avian influenza?,"Symptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenza - like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of avian influenza may depend on which virus caused the infection."
1760,What causes Avian influenza?,"The avian influenza is caused by the H5N1 virus, a subtype of type A influenza virus."
1761,Who is at highest risk for Avian influenza ?,"For current information about avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks, see the CDC Outbreaks page."
1762,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Avian influenza ?,"If there is any suspicion of avian influenza infection, it is recommended that medical care is sought immediately."
1763,What to expect if I have Avian influenza  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Of the human cases associated with the ongoing H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in Asia and parts of Europe, the Near East and Africa, more than half of those people reported infected with the virus have died. Most cases have occurred in previously healthy children and young adults and have resulted from direct or close contact with H5N1 - infected poultry or H5N1 - contaminated surfaces. In general, H5N1 remains a very rare disease in people. The H5N1 virus does not infect humans easily, and if a person is infected, it is very difficult for the virus to spread to another person."
1764,What are the symptoms of Avoidant personality disorder?,"People with avoidant personality disorder can't stop thinking about their own shortcomings. They form relationships with other people only if they believe they will not be rejected.
Loss and rejection are so painful that these people will choose to be lonely rather than risk trying to connect with others."
1765,What causes Avoidant personality disorder?,"Personality disorders are lifelong patterns of behavior that cause problems with work and relationships.
About 1% of the population has avoidant personality disorder. Both males and females have the condition equally.
The cause is unknown."
1766,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Avoidant personality disorder ?,See your health care provider or a psychiatrist if shyness or fear of rejection overwhelms your ability to function in life and relationships.
1767,What to expect if I have Avoidant personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with this disorder may develop some ability to relate to others, and this can be improved with treatment."
1768,What are the symptoms of Back pain?,"It is important to understand that back pain is a symptom of a medical condition, not a diagnosis itself. Back pain may occur by itself, or along with other symptoms. Back pain is categorized into acute pain and chronic pain.
Pain that hits you suddenly—after falling from a ladder, being tackled on the football field, or lifting a load that is too heavy, for example—is acute pain. Acute pain comes on quickly and often leaves just as quickly. To be classified as acute, pain should last no longer than 6 weeks. Acute pain is the most common type of back pain.
Chronic pain, on the other hand, may come on either quickly or slowly, and it lingers a long time. In general, pain that lasts longer than 3 months is considered chronic. Chronic pain is much less common than acute pain."
1769,What causes Back pain?,"Medical problems that can cause back pain include the following:
Mechanical problems: A mechanical problem is a problem with the way your spine moves or the way you feel when you move your spine in certain ways. Perhaps the most common mechanical cause of back pain is a condition called intervertebral disk degeneration (such as degenerative disk disease), which simply means that the disks located between the vertebrae of the spine are breaking down with age. As they deteriorate, they lose their cushioning ability. This problem can lead to pain if the back is stressed. Other mechanical causes of back pain include spasms, muscle tension, and ruptured disks, which are also called herniated disks.
Injuries: Spine injuries such as sprains and fractures can cause either short-lived or chronic pain. Sprains are tears in the ligaments that support the spine, and they can occur from twisting or lifting improperly. Fractured vertebrae are often the result of osteoporosis. Less commonly, back pain may be caused by more severe injuries that result from accidents or falls.
Acquired conditions and diseases: Many medical problems can cause or contribute to back pain. They include: Scoliosis, a curvature of the spine that does not usually cause pain until middle age Spondylolisthesis Various forms of arthritis, including: Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis Spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal column that puts pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Kidney stones or kidney infections Endometriosis, which is the buildup of uterine tissue in places outside the uterus. Fibromyalgia, a condition of widespread muscle pain and fatigue.
Additionally, although osteoporosis itself is not painful, it can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae. Pregnancy is also a common cause of back pain.
Infections and tumors: Although they are not common causes of back pain, infections can cause pain when they involve the vertebrae, a condition called osteomyelitis, or when they involve the disks that cushion the vertebrae, which is called diskitis. Tumors also are relatively rare causes of back pain.
Emotional: Although the causes of back pain are usually physical, emotional stress can play a role in how severe pain is and how long it lasts. Stress can affect the body in many ways, including causing back muscles to become tense and painful."
1770,Who is at highest risk for Back pain ?,"Although anyone can have back pain, a number of factors increase your risk. They include:
Age: The first attack of low back pain typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 40. Back pain becomes more common with age.
Fitness level: Back pain is more common among people who are not physically fit. Weak back and abdominal muscles may not properly support the spine. “Weekend warriors”—people who go out and exercise a lot after being inactive all week—are more likely to suffer painful back injuries than people who make moderate physical activity a daily habit. Studies show that low-impact aerobic exercise is good for the disks that cushion the vertebrae, the individual bones that make up the spine.
Diet: A diet high in calories and fat, combined with an inactive lifestyle, can lead to obesity, which can put stress on the back.
Heredity: Some causes of back pain, such as ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that affects the spine, have a genetic component.
Race: Race can be a factor in back problems. African American women, for example, are two to three times more likely than white women to develop spondylolisthesis, a condition in which a vertebra of the lower spine— also called the lumbar spine— slips out of place.
The presence of other diseases: Many diseases can cause or contribute to back pain. These include various forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers elsewhere in the body that may spread to the spine.
Occupational risk factors: Having a job that requires heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling, particularly when this involves twisting or vibrating the spine, can lead to injury and back pain. An inactive job or a desk job may also lead to or contribute to pain, especially if you have poor posture or sit all day in an uncomfortable chair.
Cigarette smoking: Although smoking may not directly cause back pain, it increases your risk of developing low back pain and low back pain with sciatica. For example, smoking may lead to pain by blocking your body’s ability to deliver nutrients to the disks of the lower back. Repeated coughing due to heavy smoking may also cause back pain. It is also possible that smokers are just less physically fit or less healthy than nonsmokers, which increases the likelihood that they will develop back pain. Smoking also increases the risk of osteoporosis, a condition that causes weak, porous bones, which can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae. Furthermore, smoking can slow healing, prolonging pain for people who have had back injuries, back surgery, or broken bones."
1771,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Back pain ?,"In most cases, it is not necessary to see a doctor for back pain because pain usually goes away with or without treatment. However, a trip to the doctor is probably a good idea if you have numbness or tingling, if your pain is severe and doesn’t improve with medication and rest, or if you have pain after a fall or an injury.
In most cases, it is best to see your primary care physician first. In many cases, he or she can treat the problem. In other cases, your doctor may refer you to an appropriate specialist.
It is also important to see your doctor if you have pain along with any of the following problems: trouble urinating; weakness, pain, or numbness in your legs; fever; or unintentional weight loss. Such symptoms could signal a serious problem that requires treatment soon."
1772,What to expect if I have Back pain  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook for acute back pain is very good. Many times it will leave as quickly as it came.
Chronic pain, on the other hand, may come on either quickly or slowly, and it lingers a long time. Outlook varies greatly for chronic pain, and depends on what conditions accompany it and what treatments are required.
For those patients who require surgery, the outcome is generally much more predictable in people with sciatica than in those with predominant low back pain."
1773,What are the symptoms of Bacterial vaginosis?,"Women with BV may have an abnormal vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor. Some women report a strong fish-like odor, especially after intercourse. Discharge, if present, is usually white or gray; it can be thin. Women with BV may also have burning during urination or itching around the outside of the vagina, or both. However, most women with BV report no signs or symptoms at all."
1774,What causes Bacterial vaginosis?,"The cause of BV is not fully understood. BV is associated with an imbalance in the bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. The vagina normally contains mostly ""good"" bacteria, and fewer ""harmful"" bacteria. BV develops when there is an increase in harmful bacteria.
Not much is known about how women get BV. There are many unanswered questions about the role that harmful bacteria play in causing BV.
It is not clear what role sexual activity plays in the development of BV. Women do not get BV from toilet seats, bedding, swimming pools, or from touching objects around them. Women who have never had sexual intercourse may also be affected."
1775,Who is at highest risk for Bacterial vaginosis ?,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. In the United States, BV is common in pregnant women.
Any woman can get BV. However, some activities or behaviors can upset the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina and put women at increased risk including:
Having a new sex partner or multiple sex partners Douching"
1776,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bacterial vaginosis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of uterine prolapse.
1777,What are the symptoms of Baker's cyst?,"A large cyst may cause some discomfort or stiffness, but there are often no symptoms. There may be a painless or painful swelling behind the knee.
The cyst may feel like a water-filled balloon. Sometimes, the cyst may break open (rupture), causing pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf muscle.
It is important to know whether pain or swelling is caused by a Baker's cyst or a blood clot. A blood clot (deep vein thrombosis) can also cause pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf. A blood clot may be dangerous and requires immediate medical attention."
1778,What causes Baker's cyst?,"A Baker's cyst is caused by swelling in the knee. The swelling is due to an increase in synovial fluid - the fluid that lubricates the knee joint. When pressure builds up, fluid bulges into the back of the knee.
Baker's cyst commonly occurs with:
A tear in the meniscal cartilage of the knee Knee arthritis (in older adults) Rheumatoid arthritis Other knee problems"
1779,Who is at highest risk for Baker%27s cyst ?,People with knee problems such as a meniscus tear or arthritis are at higher risk for a Baker's cyst.
1780,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Baker%27s cyst ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have swelling behind the knee that becomes large or painful. Pain could be a sign of infection.
1781,What to expect if I have Baker%27s cyst  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A Baker's cyst will not cause any long-term harm, but it can be annoying and painful. The symptoms of Baker's cysts usually come and go.
Long-term disability is rare. Most people improve with time or arthroscopic surgery."
1782,What are the symptoms of Becker's muscular dystrophy?,"Females rarely develop symptoms. Males will develop symptoms if they inherit the defective gene. Symptoms usually appear in boys at about age 12, but may begin later.
Muscle weakness of the lower body, including the legs and pelvis area, slowly gets worse, causing:
Difficulty walking that gets worse over time; by age 25-30 the person is usually unable to walk Frequent falls Difficulty with running, hopping, and jumping Loss of muscle mass
Muscle weakness in the arms, neck, and other areas is not as severe as in the lower body.
Other symptoms may include:
Breathing problems Cognitive problems (these do not get worse over time) Fatigue Loss of balance and coordination"
1783,What causes Becker's muscular dystrophy?,"Becker muscular dystrophy is very similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, except that it gets worse at a much slower rate.
The disorder is passed down through families (inherited). Having a family history of the condition raises your risk.
Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 3 - 6 out of every 100,000 males. It is less common than Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
1784,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Becker%27s muscular dystrophy ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Symptoms of Becker muscular dystrophy appear A person with Becker muscular dystrophy develops new symptoms (particularly fever with cough or breathing difficulties) You are planning to start a family and you or other family members have been diagnosed with Becker muscular dystrophy"
1785,What to expect if I have Becker%27s muscular dystrophy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Becker muscular dystrophy leads to slowly worsening disability, although the degree of disability varies. Some men may need a wheelchair, while others may only need to use walking aids such as canes or braces."
1786,What are the symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?,"Abdominal wall defect: umbilical hernia or omphalocele Creases in ear lobes Enlargement of organs and tissues External ear (pinna) abnormalities and low-set ears Large size for a newborn (large for gestational age) Large, prominent eyes Large tongue, sometimes protruding Lethargy Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Mild microcephaly Poor feeding Separated abdominal muscles (diastasis recti) Seizures Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism)"
1787,What are the causes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?,"The cause of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is unknown, but it may be genetic. Most cases are associated with a defect in chromosome 11."
1788,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ?,"If you have a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and worrisome symptoms develop, call your pediatrician immediately."
1789,What to expect if I have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome who survive infancy do well, although no long-term follow-up information is available. Mental development appears to be normal to very slightly decreased. Swelling of the tongue can cause problems with feeding and sleeping."
1790,What are the symptoms of Bell's palsy?,"Because the facial nerve has so many functions and is so complex, damage to the nerve or a disruption in its function can lead to many problems. Symptoms of Bell's palsy, which vary from person to person and range in severity from mild weakness to total paralysis, may include twitching, weakness, or paralysis on one or both sides of the face, drooping of the eyelid and corner of the mouth, drooling, dryness of the eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in one eye. Most often these symptoms, which usually begin suddenly and reach their peak within 48 hours, lead to significant facial distortion.
Other symptoms may include pain or discomfort around the jaw and behind the ear, ringing in one or both ears, headache, loss of taste, hypersensitivity to sound on the affected side, impaired speech, dizziness, and difficulty eating or drinking."
1791,What are the causes of Bell's palsy?,"Bell's palsy occurs when the nerve that controls the facial muscles is swollen, inflamed, or compressed, resulting in facial weakness or paralysis. Exactly what causes this damage, however, is unknown.
Most scientists believe that a viral infection such as viral meningitis or the common cold sore virus - herpes simplex - causes the disorder. They believe that the facial nerve swells and becomes inflamed in reaction to the infection, causing pressure within the Fallopian canal and leading to an infarction (the death of nerve cells due to insufficient blood and oxygen supply). In some mild cases (where recovery is rapid), there is damage only to the myelin sheath of the nerve. The myelin sheath is the fatty covering-which acts as an insulator-on nerve fibers in the brain.
The disorder has also been associated with influenza or a flu-like illness, headaches, chronic middle ear infection, high blood pressure, diabetes, sarcoidosis, tumors, Lyme disease, and trauma such as skull fracture or facial injury."
1792,Who is at highest risk for Bell%27s palsy ?,"Bell's palsy afflicts approximately 40,000 Americans each year. It affects men and women equally and can occur at any age, but it is less common before age 15 or after age 60. It disproportionately attacks pregnant women and people who have diabetes or upper respiratory ailments such as the flu or a cold."
1793,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bell%27s palsy ?,"Urgent medical care is not usually necessary for Bell's palsy. However, since some of the symptoms of Bell's palsy resemble the symptoms of stroke, it is important to seek medical care right away and rule out this more serious condition."
1794,What to expect if I have Bell%27s palsy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis for individuals with Bell's palsy is generally very good. The extent of nerve damage determines the extent of recovery. Improvement is gradual and recovery times vary. With or without treatment, most individuals begin to get better within 2 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms and most recover completely, returning to normal function within 3 to 6 months. For some, however, the symptoms may last longer. In a few cases, the symptoms may never completely disappear. In rare cases, the disorder may recur, either on the same or the opposite side of the face."
1795,What are the symptoms of Benign prostatic hyperplasia?,"Less than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease, which include:
Dribbling at the end of urinating Inability to urinate (urinary retention) Incomplete emptying of your bladder Incontinence Needing to urinate two or more times per night Pain with urination or bloody urine (these may indicate infection) Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream Straining to urinate Strong and sudden urge to urinate Weak urine stream"
1796,What causes Benign prostatic hyperplasia?,"The actual cause of prostate enlargement is unknown. Factors linked to aging and the testicles themselves may play a role in the growth of the gland. Men who have had their testicles removed at a young age (for example, as a result of testicular cancer) do not develop BPH.
Similarly, if the testicles are removed after a man develops BPH, the prostate begins to shrink in size."
1797,Who is at highest risk for Benign prostatic hyperplasia ?,The likelihood of developing an enlarged prostate increases with age. BPH is so common that it has been said all men will have an enlarged prostate if they live long enough. A small amount of prostate enlargement is present in many men over age 40 and more than 90% of men over age 80. No risk factors have been identified other than having normally functioning testicles.
1798,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Benign prostatic hyperplasia ?,"Call your doctor right away if you have:
Less urine than usual Fever or chills Back, side, or abdominal pain Blood or pus in your urine
Also call your doctor if:
Your bladder does not feel completely empty after you urinate You take medications that may cause urinary problems, like diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or sedatives. Do NOT stop or adjust your medications on your own without talking to your doctor You have taken self-care measures for 2 months without relief"
1799,What to expect if I have Benign prostatic hyperplasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treatments options as stated above are likely to relieve symptoms. Surgery is slightly more successful in relieving symptoms, but the risk of complications is greater."
1800,What are the symptoms of biliary atresia?,"Newborns with this condition may appear normal at birth. However, jaundice (a yellow color to the skin and mucous membranes) develops by the second or third week of life. The infant may gain weight normally for the first month, but then will lose weight and become irritable, and have worsening jaundice. Other symptoms may include:
Dark urine Enlarged spleen Floating stools Foul-smelling stools Pale or clay-colored stools Slow growth Slow or no weight gain"
1801,Who is at highest risk for Biliary atresia ?,"Biliary atresia is common form of chronic liver disease in newborns, affecting one in every 15,000 live births. As with many congenital conditions, a family history of biliary atresia increases the likelihood of potential for having the condition. Genetically, biliary atresia is linked most frequently to Asian and African American populations. Comparative, as many as two times the number of African Americans are affected with biliary atresia as compared to their Caucasian counterparts."
1802,What causes Biliary atresia?,"Biliary atresia occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not develop normally. It is not known why the biliary system fails to develop normally. The bile ducts help remove waste from the liver and carry salts that help the small intestine break down (digest) fat. In babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which is deadly if not treated."
1803,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Biliary atresia ?,"Call your health care provider if your child appears jaundiced, or if other symptoms of biliary atresia develop."
1804,What to expect if I have Biliary atresia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Early surgery will improve the survival of more than a third of babies with this condition. The long-term benefit of liver transplant is not yet known, but is expected to improve survival."
1805,What are the symptoms of Binge eating disorder?,"A binge eater often:
Eats 5,000 - 15,000 calories in one sitting Frequently snacks, in addition to eating three meals a day Overeats throughout the day, rather than simply consuming large amounts of food during binges
Binge eating by itself usually leads to becoming overweight.
Binge eating may occur on its own or in the context of an eating disorder, such as bulimia. People with bulimia typically eat large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. After this binge eating they often force themselves to vomit or take laxatives."
1806,What causes Binge eating disorder?,"The cause of binge eating is unknown. However, binge eating often begins during or after strict dieting."
1807,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Binge eating ?,Call your health care provider if you think you might have a pattern of binge eating or bulimia.
1808,What are the symptoms of Bipolar disorder ?,"The manic phase may last from days to months. It can include the following symptoms:
Easily distracted Little need for sleep Poor judgment Poor temper control Reckless behavior and lack of self control Binge eating, drinking, and/or drug use Poor judgment Sex with many partners (promiscuity) Spending sprees Very elevated mood Excess activity (hyperactivity) Increased energy Racing thoughts Talking a lot Very high self-esteem (false beliefs about self or abilities) Very involved in activities Very upset (agitated or irritated)
These symptoms of mania occur with bipolar disorder I. In people with bipolar disorder II, the symptoms of mania are similar but less intense.
The depressed phase of both types of bipolar disorder includes the following symptoms:
Daily low mood or sadness Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions Eating problems Loss of appetite and weight loss Overeating and weight gain Fatigue or lack of energy Feeling worthless, hopeless, or guilty Loss of pleasure in activities once enjoyed Loss of self-esteem Thoughts of death and suicide Trouble getting to sleep or sleeping too much Pulling away from friends or activities that were once enjoyed
There is a high risk of suicide with bipolar disorder. Patients may abuse alcohol or other substances, which can make the symptoms and suicide risk worse.
Sometimes the two phases overlap. Manic and depressive symptoms may occur together or quickly one after the other in what is called a mixed state."
1809,What are the causes of Bipolar disorder ?,"Bipolar disorder affects men and women equally. It usually starts between ages 15 - 25. The exact cause is unknown, but it occurs more often in relatives of people with bipolar disorder.
Types of bipolar disorder:
People with bipolar disorder type I have had at least one manic episode and may have had periods of major depression. In the past, bipolar disorder type I was called manic depression. People with bipolar disorder type II have never had full mania. Instead they experience periods of high energy levels and impulsiveness that are not as extreme as mania (called hypomania). These periods alternate with episodes of depression. A mild form of bipolar disorder called cyclothymia involves less severe mood swings. People with this form alternate between hypomania and mild depression. People with bipolar disorder type II or cyclothymia may be wrongly diagnosed as having depression.
In most people with bipolar disorder, there is no clear cause for the manic or depressive episodes. The following may trigger a manic episode in people with bipolar disorder:
Life changes such as childbirth Medications such as antidepressants or steroids Periods of sleeplessness Recreational drug use"
1810,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bipolar disorder ?,"Call your health provider or an emergency number right way if:
You are having thoughts of death or suicide You are experiencing severe symptoms of depression or mania You have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and your symptoms have returned or you are having any new symptoms"
1811,What to expect if I have Bipolar disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Mood stabilizers can help control the symptoms of bipolar disorder. However, patients often need help and support to take medicine properly and to make sure that mania and depression are treated as early as possible.
Some people stop taking the medication as soon as they feel better or because the mania feels good. Stopping medication can cause serious problems.
Suicide is a very real risk during both mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder or think or talk about suicide need immediate emergency attention."
1812,What are the symptoms of Blepharitis?,"The eyelids appear red and irritated, with scales that stick to the base of the eyelashes. The eyelids may be:
Crusty Reddened Swollen Itching Burning
You may feel like you have sand or dust in your eye when you blink. Sometimes, the eyelashes may fall out."
1813,What causes Blepharitis?,"Blepharitis is caused by an overgrowth of the bacteria that is normally found on the skin. It is usually due to seborrheic dermatitis or a bacterial infection. Both may occur at the same time.
The cause is overgrowth of the bacteria that is normally found on the skin.
Allergies and lice that affects the eyelashes may also cause blepharitis, although these causes are less common.
People who have blepharitis have too much oil being produced by the glands near the eyelid. This allows bacteria normally found on the skin to overgrow."
1814,Who is at highest risk for Blepharitis ?,"Blepharitis may be linked to repeated styes and chalazia. You are more likely to develop this condition if you have seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp, rosacea, lice, and allergies."
1815,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Blepharitis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms worsen or do not improve after careful cleansing of the eyelids for several days.
1816,What to expect if I have Blepharitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The likely outcome is good with treatment. Continued attention to lid cleanliness may be required to prevent repeated problems. Continued treatment will typically make the eyes less red and more comfortable.
1817,What causes Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy?,"During the first 3 months, vaginal bleeding may be a sign of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. See the doctor right away.
During months 4 - 9 bleeding may be a sign of:
Abruptio placentae Miscarriage Placenta previa Vasa previa
Other possible causes of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy:
Early labor (bloody show) Ectopic pregnancy Infection of the cervix Trauma to the cervix from intercourse (small amount of bleeding)
Other diseases and medications can cause bleeding during pregnancy. The causes may differ depending on your age.
Characteristics of the bleeding can indicate its causes. These include:
Length of bleeding Quality (light or heavy bleeding, with or without pain) What makes the bleeding better What makes the bleeding worse"
1818,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bloody show ?,"Contact your health care provider if:
There is a chance of miscarriage. You have any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Treat this as a potential emergency. You have vaginal bleeding and have placenta previa (get to the hospital right away)."
1819,What are the symptoms of Body dysmorphic disorder?,"Symptoms can vary according to which body part (or parts) are targeted, but general symptoms of BDD include:
Thinking about the perceived defect for hours every day Worrying about their failure to match the physical perfection of models and celebrities Distress about their preoccupation Constantly asking trusted loved ones for reassurance about their looks, but not believing the answer Constantly looking at their reflection or taking pains to avoid catching their reflection (for example, throwing away or covering up mirrors) Constant dieting and overexercising Grooming to excess (for example, shaving the same patch of skin over and over) Avoiding any situation they feel will call attention to their defect. In extreme cases, this can mean never leaving home Taking great pains to hide or camouflage the defect Squeezing or picking at skin blemishes for hours on end Wanting dermatological treatment or cosmetic surgery, even when professionals believe the treatment is unnecessary Repeat cosmetic surgery procedures, especially if the same body part is being improved with each procedure Depression and anxiety, including suicidal thoughts."
1820,What causes Body dysmorphic disorder?,"About 1 - 2% of the population may have BDD, with men and women equally affected.
BDD usually starts in the teenage years, when concern over physical appearance is common.
The cause of BDD is unknown. Theories include:
A person with BDD has a genetic tendency to develop this type of mental illness. The trigger may be the stress of adolescence. Particular drugs, such as ecstasy, may trigger onset in susceptible people. BDD could be caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. A person with low self-esteem who has impossible standards of perfection judges some part of their body as ugly. Over time, this behaviour becomes more and more compulsive. Western society’s narrow standards of beauty may trigger BDD in vulnerable people."
1821,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Body dysmorphic disorder ?,"If you suspect you have BDD, see your doctor or a mental health professional."
1822,How often does Bone cancer occur?,"Primary bone cancer is rare. It accounts for much less than 1 percent of all cancers. About 2,300 new cases of primary bone cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year (5). Different types of bone cancer are more likely to occur in certain populations:
Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly between ages 10 and 19. However, people over age 40 who have other conditions, such as Paget disease (a benign condition characterized by abnormal development of new bone cells), are at increased risk of developing this cancer.
Chondrosarcoma occurs mainly in older adults (over age 40). The risk increases with advancing age. This disease rarely occurs in children and adolescents.
ESFTs occur most often in children and adolescents under 19 years of age. Boys are affected more often than girls. These tumors are extremely rare in African American children."
1823,What are the symptoms of Bone cancer?,"Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer, but not all bone cancers cause pain (1). Persistent or unusual pain or swelling in or near a bone can be caused by cancer or by other conditions. It is important to see a doctor to determine the cause."
1824,What causes Bone cancer?,"Although bone cancer does not have a clearly defined cause, researchers have identified several factors that increase the likelihood of developing these tumors. Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy or treatment with certain anticancer drugs; children seem to be particularly susceptible. A small number of bone cancers are due to heredity. For example, children who have had hereditary retinoblastoma (an uncommon cancer of the eye) are at a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly if they are treated with radiation. Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones and people with metal implants, which doctors sometimes use to repair fractures, are more likely to develop osteosarcoma (4). Ewing sarcoma is not strongly associated with any heredity cancer syndromes, congenital childhood diseases, or previous radiation exposure (2)."
1825,Are clinical trials (research studies) available for people with Bone cancer?,"Yes. Participation in clinical trials is an important treatment option for many people with bone cancer. To develop new treatments and better ways to use current treatments, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring clinical trials in many hospitals and cancer centers around the country. Clinical trials are a critical step in the development of new methods of treatment. Before any new treatment can be recommended for general use, doctors conduct clinical trials to find out whether the treatment is safe for patients and effective against the disease.
People interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk with their doctor. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI’s Cancer Information Service (CIS) (see below) at 1–800–4–CANCER and in the NCI booklet Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies, which can be found at http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/Taking-Part-in-Cancer-Treatment-Research-Studies on the Internet. This booklet describes how research studies are carried out and explains their possible benefits and risks. Further information about clinical trials is available at http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials on the NCI’s Web site. The Web site offers detailed information about specific ongoing studies by linking to PDQ®, the NCI’s comprehensive cancer information database. The CIS also provides information from PDQ."
1826,What are the symptoms of Borderline personality disorder?,"People with BPD are often uncertain about their identity. As a result, their interests and values may change rapidly.
People with BPD also tend to see things in terms of extremes, such as either all good or all bad. Their views of other people may change quickly. A person who is looked up to one day may be looked down on the next day. These suddenly shifting feelings often lead to intense and unstable relationships.
Other symptoms of BPD include:
Fear of being abandoned Feelings of emptiness and boredom Frequent displays of inappropriate anger Impulsiveness with money, substance abuse, sexual relationships, binge eating, or shoplifting Intolerance of being alone Repeated crises and acts of self-injury, such as wrist cutting or overdosing"
1827,What causes Borderline personality disorder?,"The causes of borderline personality disorder (BPD) are unknown. Genetic, family, and social factors are thought to play roles.
This personality disorder tends to occur more often in women and among hospitalized psychiatric patients."
1828,Who is at highest risk for Borderline personality disorder ?,"Risk factors for BPD include:
Abandonment in childhood or adolescence Disrupted family life Poor communication in the family Sexual abuse"
1829,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Borderline personality disorder ?,Call your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms of borderline personality disorder. It is especially important to seek help right away if you or your child is having thoughts of suicide.
1830,What to expect if I have Borderline personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on how severe the condition is and whether the person is willing to accept help. With long-term talk therapy, the person will often gradually improve."
1831,What are the symptoms of Bornholm disease?,"Symptoms may include fever and headache, but the distinguishing characteristic of this disease is attacks of severe pain in the lower chest, often on one side.  The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase of pain, which makes it very difficult to breathe, and an attack is therefore quite a frightening experience, although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs. The attacks are unpredictable and strike ""out of the blue"" with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as'The Devil's grip' reflect this symptom.
Once inside the body, the coxsackie viruses multiply in the throat and intestines then spread into the bloodstream. At this point, the body's immune defenses often can limit the infection and prevent the person from developing symptoms. If the immune defenses are less successful, the person develops a fever or other symptoms, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and sore throat. Only a few infected people develop the classic muscle pain in the chest and upper abdomen that gives the disease its name. In these people, the coxsackie virus infection has settled in the muscles of the chest and upper abdomen, causing inflammation there. The chest pain usually feels worse with deep breathing, called pleuritic pain. It can be a severe, stabbing pain or it can be a milder cramping in the side. Usually, only one side of the chest or abdomen is affected, although occasionally the pain can include muscles of the neck or arms. The pain usually comes in waves that last 15 to 30 minutes, although some people report having pain episodes that last for several hours. The pain can be so severe that you have trouble breathing, sweat a lot and become anxious."
1832,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bornholm disease ?,Call your doctor immediately if you or someone in your family develops severe chest pain.
1833,What to expect if I have Bornholm disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The illness lasts about a week and is rarely fatal. Relapses during the weeks following the initial episode are a characteristic feature of this disease. Almost all generally healthy individuals recover completely from pleurodynia. However, about 5% of people develop acute viral meningitis as a complication of the coxsackie virus infection, and about 5% of adult males develop orchitis. Less common complications include hepatitis, pericarditis and myocarditis."
1834,What are symptoms of Botulism?,"Symptoms usually appear 8 - 36 hours after consuming contaminated food. There is NO fever with this infection. In adults, symptoms may include:
Abdominal cramps Breathing difficulty that may lead to respiratory failure Difficulty swallowing and speaking Double vision Dry mouth Nausea Temporary lack of breathing Vomiting Weakness with paralysis (equal on both sides of the body)
Symptoms in infants may include:
Constipation Weakness, loss of muscle tone Weak cry Poor feeding and weak sucking Respiratory distress Alertness, despite weakness"
1835,What causes Botulism?,"Clostridium botulinum is found in soil and untreated water throughout the world. It produces spores that survive in improperly preserved or canned food, where they produce toxin. When eaten, even tiny amounts of this toxin can lead to severe poisoning. The foods most commonly contaminated are home-canned vegetables, cured pork and ham, smoked or raw fish, and honey or corn syrup. Botulism may also occur if the organism enters open wounds and produces toxin there. Infant botulism occurs when living bacteria or its spores are eaten and grow within the baby's gastrointestinal tract. The most common cause of infant botulism is eating honey or corn syrup. Clostridium botulinum also occurs normally in the stool of some infants. Approximately 110 cases of botulism occur in the U.S. per year. The majority are in infants."
1836,Who is at highest risk for Botulism ?,"Infants are especially vulnerable to botulism. If you utilize home canning methods you, too, may be at an increased risk for contracting botulism."
1837,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Botulism ?,Botulism can be life-threatening if left untreated. Contact your doctor immediately if you suspect you or your baby have botulism.
1838,What to expect if I have Botulism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prompt treatment significantly reduces the risk of death.
1839,What are the symptoms of Bowel obstruction?,"The symptoms of a bowel obstruction include:
Abdominal distention Abdominal fullness, gaseous Abdominal pain and cramping Breath odor Constipation Diarrhea Vomiting
Upright abdominal X-ray demonstrating a small bowel obstruction. Note multiple air fluid levels."
1840,What causes Bowel obstruction?,"Obstruction of the bowel may due to:
A mechanical cause, which simply means something is in the way Ileus, a condition in which the bowel doesn't work correctly but there is no structural problem
Paralytic ileus, also called pseudo-obstruction, is one of the major causes of bowel obstruction in infants and children. Causes of paralytic ileus may include:
Chemical, electrolyte, or mineral disturbances (such as decreased potassium levels) Complications of intra-abdominal surgery Decreased blood supply to the abdominal area (mesenteric artery ischemia) Injury to the abdominal blood supply Intra-abdominal infection Kidney or lung disease Use of certain medications, especially narcotics
In older children, paralytic ileus may be due to bacterial, viral, or food poisoning (gastroenteritis), which is sometimes associated with secondary peritonitis and appendicitis.
Mechanical causes of a bowel obstruction may include:
Abnormal tissue growth Adhesions or scar tissue that form after surgery Foreign bodies (ingested materials that obstruct the intestines) Gallstones Hernias Impacted feces Intussusception Tumors blocking the intestines Volvulus"
1841,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bowel obstruction ?,"Call your health care provider if persistent abdominal distention develops and you are unable to pass stool or gas, or if other symptoms of bowel obstruction develop."
1842,What are the symptoms of Brain abscess?,"Symptoms may develop slowly, over a period of 2 weeks, or they may develop suddenly. They may include:
Changes in mental status Confusion Decreasing responsiveness Drowsiness Eventual coma Inattention Irritability Slow thought processes Decreased movement Decreased sensation Decreased speech (aphasia) Fever and chills Headache Language difficulties Loss of coordination Loss of muscle function Seizures Stiff neck Vision changes Vomiting"
1843,What causes Brain abscess?,"Brain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. Swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop in response to this infection. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria, and fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass.
While this immune response can protect the brain by isolating the infection, it can also do more harm than good. The brain swells. Because the skull cannot expand, the mass may put pressure on delicate brain tissue. Infected material can block the blood vessels of the brain.
The germs that cause a brain abscess usually reach the brain through the blood. The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is to blame. Germs may also travel from a nearby infected area (for example, an ear infection) or enter the body during an injury (such as a gun or knife wound) or surgery.
In children with heart disease or a birth defect, such as those with tetralogy of fallot, infections are more able to reach the brain from the intestines, teeth, or other body areas."
1844,Who is at highest risk for Brain abscess ?,"The following raise your risk of a brain abscess:
A weakened immune system (such as in AIDS patients) Chronic disease, such as cancer or Osler-weber-rendu syndrome Drugs that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy) Right-to-left heart shunts, usually the result of congenital heart disease"
1845,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Brain abscess ?,Go to a hospital emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of a brain abscess.
1846,What to expect if I have Brain abscess  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If untreated, a brain abscess is almost always deadly. With treatment, the death rate is about 10 - 30%. The earlier treatment is received, the better.
Some patients may have long-term neurological problems after surgery."
1847,What are the symptoms of Brain herniation?,"Symptoms of Brain herniation include:
Coma Lack of energy and tiredness Cardiac arrest (no heartbeat) Respiratory arrest (inability to breathe) Loss of consciousness Loss of brainstem reflexes blinking pupil dilation gag reflex"
1848,What are the causes of Brain herniation?,"Causes of Brain herniation can include:
Brain tumors Metastatic brain tumor Primary brain tumor Hemorrhage Abscess Stroke Hydrocephalus (""water on the brain"")"
1849,Who is at highest risk for Brain herniation ?,People who have suffered a stroke or have a brain tumor are at a high risk of developing Brain herniation.
1850,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Brain herniation ?,Call 911 and seek medical treatment immediately if you suspect Brain herniation or you experience any of the symptoms listed above. Brain herniation is a medical emergency and can result in death if left untreated.
1851,What to expect if I have Brain herniation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Brain herniation is a severe condition that can cause stroke and may lead to impaired breathing, impaired neurological functioning, or death. The outlook will depend on where the herniation is located in the brain and how quickly treatment is sought.
If treatment is not sought death is a likely outcome."
1852,What are the symptoms of Brain tumor?,"Early brain tumor does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Epileptic seizures Decreased sensation of a body area Dysfunctional movement or uncontrollable movement Speech difficulties Double vision or decreased vision Hearing loss Personality and behavior changes Emotional instability Hiccups
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
1853,What are the types of Brain tumor?,"Brain tumors are classified depending on the exact site of the tumor, the type of tissue involved, whether they are noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), and other factors. Sometimes, tumors that start out being less invasive can become more invasive.
Tumors may occur at any age, but many types of tumors are most common in a certain age group. In adults, gliomas and meningiomas are most common.
Gliomas come from glial cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. The gliomas are divided into three types:
Astrocytic tumors include astrocytomas (less malignant), anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas (most malignant). Oligodendroglial tumors also can vary from less malignant to very malignant. Some primary brain tumors are made up of both astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors. These are called mixed gliomas. Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor.
Meningiomas are another type of brain tumor. These tumors:
Occur most commonly between the ages of 40 - 70 Are much more common in women Are usually (90% of the time) benign, but still may cause devastating complications and death due to their size or location. Some are cancerous and aggressive.
Other primary brain tumors in adults are rare. These include:
Ependymomas Craniopharyngiomas Pituitary tumors Primary lymphoma of the brain Pineal gland tumors Primary germ cell tumors of the brain"
1854,Who is at highest risk for Brain tumor ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of brain tumor is related to several factors.
Radiation exposure Family history Immune system disorders Cell phone use: There has been a great deal of debate in recent years."
1855,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Brain tumor ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of brain tumor develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
New, or suddenly develop stupor New, or suddenly develop vision changes New, or suddenly develop speech changes Consciousness disorders"
1856,What to expect if I have Brain tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of brain tumor depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The location of the tumor The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the brain Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred The patient’s general health"
1857,What are the symptoms of Breast cancer?,"Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in size or shape of the breast or discharge from a nipple.
Swelling of all or part of a breast (even if no distinct lump is felt) Skin irritation or dimpling Breast or nipple pain Nipple retraction (turning inward) Redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin A discharge other than breast milk
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
1858,Who is at highest risk for Breast cancer ?,"No one knows the exact causes of breast cancer. Doctors often cannot explain why one woman develops breast cancer and another does not. They do know that bumping, bruising, or touching the breast does not cause cancer. And breast cancer is not contagious. You cannot ""catch"" it from another person.
Research has shown that women with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop breast cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of developing a disease.
Age: The chance of getting breast cancer goes up as a woman gets older. Most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 60. This disease is not common before menopause.
Personal history of breast cancer: A woman who had breast cancer in one breast has an increased risk of getting cancer in her other breast.
Family history: A woman's risk of breast cancer is higher if her mother, sister, or daughter had breast cancer. The risk is higher if her family member got breast cancer before age 40. Having other relatives with breast cancer (in either her mother's or father's family) may also increase a woman's risk.
Certain breast changes: Some women have cells in the breast that look abnormal under a microscope. Having certain types of abnormal cells (atypical hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS) increases the risk of breast cancer.
Gene changes: Changes in certain genes increase the risk of breast cancer. These genes include BRCA1, BRCA2, and others. Tests can sometimes show the presence of specific gene changes in families with many women who have had breast cancer. Health care providers may suggest ways to try to reduce the risk of breast cancer, or to improve the detection of this disease in women who have these changes in their genes. NCI offers publications on gene testing.
Reproductive and menstrual history: The older a woman is when she has her first child, the greater her chance of breast cancer. Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who went through menopause after age 55 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who never had children are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who take menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin after menopause also appear to have an increased risk of breast cancer. Large, well-designed studies have shown no link between abortion or miscarriage and breast cancer.
Race: Breast cancer is diagnosed more often in white women than Latina, Asian, or African American women.
Radiation therapy to the chest: Women who had radiation therapy to the chest (including breasts) before age 30 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. This includes women treated with radiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Studies show that the younger a woman was when she received radiation treatment, the higher her risk of breast cancer later in life.
Breast density: Breast tissue may be dense or fatty. Older women whose mammograms (breast x-rays) show more dense tissue are at increased risk of breast cancer.
Taking DES (diethylstilbestrol): DES was given to some pregnant women in the United States between about 1940 and 1971. (It is no longer given to pregnant women.) Women who took DES during pregnancy may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. The possible effects on their daughters are under study.
Being overweight or obese after menopause: The chance of getting breast cancer after menopause is higher in women who are overweight or obese.
Lack of physical activity: Women who are physically inactive throughout life may have an increased risk of breast cancer. Being active may help reduce risk by preventing weight gain and obesity.
Drinking alcohol: Studies suggest that the more alcohol a woman drinks, the greater her risk of breast cancer."
1859,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Breast cancer ?,"See your health care provider about a breast change when you have:
A lump in or near your breast or under your arm Thick or firm tissue in or near your breast or under your arm Nipple discharge or tenderness A nipple pulled back (inverted) into the breast Itching or skin changes such as redness, scales, dimples, or puckers A change in breast size or shape"
1860,What to expect if I have Breast cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Survival rates for Breast Cancer
80.4% of women with breast cancer survive after 5 years in the US 1983-90 (SEER) Breast cancer survival rates by stage of disease:
100% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected before it starts to spread in the US (The American Cancer Society) 98% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected while it is smaller than 2cm in diameter and hasn’t spread in the US (The American Cancer Society) 88% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected while it is 2-5cm in diameter and has spread to axillary lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 76% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected even over 5cm in diameter if it hasn’t spread to axillary lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 76% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected while it is 2-5cm in diameter and has spread to axillary lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 56% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected after it has spread to axillary lymph nodes and to axillary tissues in the US (The American Cancer Society) 49% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected after it has attached itself to the chest wall and chest lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 16% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected after it has spread to other parts of the body such as bone, lung or liver in the US (The American Cancer Society)"
1861,What causes Breast lumps?,"Lumps in a woman are often caused by fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas, and cysts.
Fibrocystic changes are painful, lumpy breasts. Fibrocystic breast changes do not increase your risk of breast cancer. Symptoms are usually worse right before your menstrual period, and then improve after your period starts.
Fibroadenomas are noncancerous lumps that feel rubbery. They move easily inside the breast tissue. Like fibrocystic changes, they occur most often during the reproductive years. Usually, they are not tender. Except in rare cases, they do not become cancerous later. A doctor can feel during an exam whether a lump is a fibroadenoma. The only way to be sure, however, is to remove or biopsy the lump.
Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that often feel like soft grapes. These can sometimes be tender, especially just before your menstrual period.
Other causes of breast lumps include:
Breast cancer
Injury -- sometimes if your breast is badly bruised, there will be a collection of blood that feels like a lump. These lumps tend to get better on their own in a few days or weeks. If they do not improve, your doctor may have to drain the blood.
Lipoma -- a collection of fatty tissue
Milk cysts (sacs filled with milk) and infections (mastitis), which may turn into an abscess. These typically occur if you are breastfeeding or have recently given birth."
1862,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Breast lumps ?,"Call your doctor if:
The skin on your breast appears dimpled or wrinkled (like the peel of an orange) You find a new breast lump during your monthly self-exam You have bruising on your breast, but did not experience any injury You have nipple discharge, especially if it is bloody or pinkish (blood-tinged) Your nipple is inverted (turned inward) but normally is not inverted
Also call if:
You are a woman, age 20 or older, and want guidance on how to perform a breast self-examination You are a woman over age 40 and have not had a mammogram in the past year"
1863,What are the symptoms of Brief reactive psychosis?,"Symptoms of brief reactive psychosis may include the following:
Disorganized behavior False ideas about what is taking place (delusions) Hearing or seeing things that aren't real (hallucinations) Strange speech or language
The symptoms are not due to alcohol or other drug abuse and they last longer than a day, but less than a month."
1864,What causes Brief reactive psychosis?,"Brief reactive psychosis is triggered by extreme stress (such as a traumatic accident or loss of a loved one), and is followed by a return to the previous level of function. The person may or may not be aware of the strange behavior.
This condition most often affects people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. People who have personality disorders are at greater risk for having a brief reactive psychosis."
1865,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Brief reactive psychosis ?,"Call for an appointment with a mental health professional if you have symptoms of this disorder. If you are concerned for your safety or for the safety of someone else, call the local emergency number (such as 911) or go immediately to the nearest emergency room."
1866,What to expect if I have Brief reactive psychosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most people with this disorder have a good outcome. Repeat episodes may occur in response to stress.
1867,What are the symptoms of Bronchiolitis?,"Some children have infections with few or minor symptoms.
Bronchiolitis begins as a mild upper respiratory infection. Over a period of 2 - 3 days, it can develop into increasing respiratory distress with wheezing and a ""tight"" wheezy cough.
The infant's breathing rate may increase (tachypnea), and the infant may become irritable or anxious-looking. If the disease is severe enough, the infant may turn bluish (cyanotic), which is an emergency.
As the effort of breathing increases, parents may see the child's nostrils flaring with each breath and the muscles between the ribs retracting (intercostal retractions) as the child tries to breathe in air. This can be exhausting for the child, and very young infants may become so tired that they have difficulty maintaining breathing.
Symptoms include:
Bluish skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing Fever Intercostal retractions Nasal flaring in infants Rapid breathing (tachypnea)"
1868,What causes Bronchiolitis?,"Bronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2, with a peak age of 3 - 6 months. It is a common, and sometimes severe illness. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause. Other viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include:
Adenovirus Influenza Parainfluenza
The virus is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with nasal fluids, or by airborne droplets. Although RSV generally causes only mild symptoms in an adult, it can cause severe illness in an infant.
Bronchiolitis is seasonal and appears more often in the fall and winter months. It is a very common reason for infants to be hospitalized during winter and early spring. It is estimated that by their first year, more than half of all infants have been exposed to RSV.
Risk factors include:
Exposure to cigarette smoke Age younger than 6 months old Living in crowded conditions Lack of breast-feeding Prematurity (being born before 37 weeks gestation)"
1869,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bronchiolitis ?,"Call your health care provider immediately, or go to the emergency room if the child with bronchiolitis:
Becomes lethargic Develops a bluish color in the skin, nails, or lips Develops rapid, shallow breathing Has a cold that suddenly worsens Has difficulty breathing Flares nostrils or retracts chest muscles in an effort to breathe"
1870,What to expect if I have Bronchiolitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Usually, the symptoms get better within a week, and breathing difficulty usually improves by the third day. The mortality rate is less than 1%."
1871,What are the symptoms of Brucellosis?,"Acute brucellosis may begin with mild flu -like symptoms, or symptoms such as:
Abdominal pain Back pain Chills Excessive sweating Fatigue Fever Headache Joint pain Loss of appetite Weakness Weight loss
High fever spikes usually occur every afternoon. The name ""undulant"" fever is because the fever rises and falls in waves.
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Muscle pain Swollen glands
The illness may be chronic and last for years."
1872,What causes Brucellosis?,"Brucella can infect cattle, goats, camels, dogs, and pigs. The bacteria can spread to humans if you come in contact with infected meat or the placenta of infected animals, or if you eat or drink unpasteurized milk or cheese. Brucellosis is rare in the United States."
1873,Who is at highest risk for Brucellosis ?,"People working in jobs where they often come in contact with animals or meat such as slaughterhouse workers, farmers, and veterinarians, are at higher risk."
1874,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Brucellosis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of brucellosis Your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment You develop new symptoms"
1875,What to expect if I have Brucellosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Relapses may occur, and symptoms may continue for years. As with tuberculosis, the illness can come back after a long period of time."
1876,What are the symptoms of Bruxism?,"Clenching the teeth puts pressure on the muscles, tissues, and other structures around your jaw. The symptoms can cause temporomandibular joint problems (TMJ).
Grinding can wear down your teeth. Grinding can be noisy enough at night to bother sleeping partners.
Symptoms include:
Anxiety, stress, and tension Depression Earache (due in part because the structures of the temporomandibular joint are very close to the ear canal, and because you can feel pain in a different location than its source; this is called referred pain) Eating disorders Headache Hot, cold, or sweet sensitivity in the teeth Insomnia Sore or painful jaw"
1877,What causes Bruxism?,"People can clench and grind without being aware of it during both the day and night, although sleep-related bruxism is often the bigger problem because it is harder to control.
The cause of bruxism is not completely agreed upon, but daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench their teeth and never feel symptoms.
Whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems may be a complicated mix of factors:
How much stress you are under How long and tightly you clench and grind Whether your teeth are misaligned Your posture Your ability to relax Your diet Your sleeping habits Each person is probably different."
1878,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bruxism ?,"There is no recognized TMJ specialty in dentistry. See a dentist immediately if you are having trouble eating or opening your mouth. Keep in mind that a wide variety of possible conditions can cause TMJ symptoms, from arthritis to whiplash injuries. Therefore, see your dentist for a full evaluation if self-care measures do not help within several weeks.
Grinding and clenching does not fall clearly into one medical disciplines. For a massage-based approach, look for a massage therapist trained in trigger point therapy, neuromuscular therapy, or clinical massage.
Dentists who have more experience in evaluating and treating TMJ disorders will typically take x-rays and prescribe a mouth guard. Surgery is now considered a last resort for TMJ."
1879,What to expect if I have Bruxism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Bruxism is not a dangerous disorder. However, it can cause permanent damage to the teeth and uncomfortable jaw pain, headaches, or ear pain."
1880,What are the symptoms of Bubonic plague?,"Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly, usually after 2 - 5 days of exposure to the bacteria. Symptoms include:
Chills General ill feeling (malaise) High fever Muscle pain Severe headache Seizures Smooth, painful lymph gland swelling called a bubo Commonly found in the groin, but may occur in the armpits or neck, most often at the site of the initial infection (bite or scratch) Pain may occur in the area before the swelling appears"
1881,What causes Bubonic plague?,"Plague is caused by the organism yersinia pestis. Rodents, such as rats, spread the disease to humans. People can get the plague when they are bitten by a flea that carries the plague bacteria from an infected rodent. In rare cases, you may get the disease when handling an infected animal. Certain forms of the plague can be spread from human to human. When someone with pneumonic plague coughs, microscopic droplets carrying the infection move through the air. Anyone who breathes in these particles may catch the disease. An epidemic may be started this way. In the Middle Ages, massive plague epidemics killed millions of people. Today, plague is rare in the United States, but has been known to occur in parts of California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. The time between being infected and developing symptoms is typically 2 to 10 days, but may be as short as a few hours for pneumonic plague."
1882,Who is at highest risk for Bubonic plague ?,"People can get the plague when they are bitten by a flea that carries the plague bacteria from an infected rodent. In rare cases, you may get the disease when handling an infected animal. Risk factors for plague include a recent flea bite and exposure to rodents, especially rabbits, squirrels, or prairie dogs, or scratches or bites from infected domestic cats."
1883,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bubonic plague ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop plague symptoms after exposure to fleas or rodents, especially if you live in or have visited an area where plague occurs."
1884,What to expect if I have Bubonic plague  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, about 50 - 90% of those with bubonic plague die. Almost all people with pneumonic plague die if not treated. Treatment reduces the death rate to 50%."
1885,What are the symptoms of Budd-Chiari syndrome?,"Symptoms of Budd-Chiari syndrome include the following:
Abdominal swelling or stretching Pain in the right upper abdomen Vomiting blood Yellowing of the skin (jaundice)"
1886,What causes Budd-Chiari syndrome?,"Hepatic vein obstruction prevents blood from flowing out of the liver and back to the heart. This blockage can cause liver damage. Obstruction of this vein can be caused by a tumor or growth pressing on the vessel, or by a clot in the vessel (hepatic vein thrombosis).
Most often, it is caused by conditions that make blood clots more likely to form, including:
Abnormal growth of cells in the bone marrow (myeloproliferative disorders) Cancers Chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases Infections Inherited (hereditary) or acquired problems with blood clotting Oral contraceptives Pregnancy
Hepatic vein obstruction is the most common cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome."
1887,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Budd-Chiari syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of hepatic vein obstruction You are being treated for this condition and you develop new symptoms"
1888,What are the symptoms of Bulimia nervosa?,"In bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months.
People with bulimia often eat large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. People can feel a lack of control over their eating during these episodes.
Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include:
Forcing oneself to vomit Excessive exercise Use of laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills)
Purging often brings a sense of relief.
People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder.
Symptoms can include:
Compulsive exercise Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away"
1889,What causes Bulimia nervosa?,"Many more women than men have bulimia. The disorder is most common in adolescent girls and young women.
The affected person is usually aware that her eating pattern is abnormal and may feel fear or guilt with the binge-purge episodes.
The exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Genetic, psychological, trauma, family, society, or cultural factors may play a role. Bulimia is likely due to more than one factor."
1890,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bulimia nervosa ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you (or your child) have symptoms of an eating disorder.
1891,What to expect if I have Bulimia nervosa  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Bulimia is a long-term illness. Many people will still have some symptoms, even with treatment.
People with fewer medical complications of bulimia, and those who are willing and able to take part in therapy have a better chance of recovery."
1892,What are the symptoms of Burkitt's lymphoma?,"Burkitt lymphoma may first be noticed as a swelling of the lymph nodes (glands) in the neck, groin, or under the arm. These swollen lymph nodes are often painless, but can grow very rapidly.
In the types commonly seen in the United States, the cancer usually starts in the belly area (abdomen). The disease can also start in the ovaries, testes, brain, and spinal fluid.
Symptoms include:
Lymph nodes that grow together to form a lump Nontender lymph nodes Rapid growth of the lymph nodes Unexplained swollen lymph nodes"
1893,What causes Burkitt's lymphoma?,"Burkitt lymphoma was first discovered in children in certain parts of Africa, but it also occurs in the United States.
The African type of Burkitt lymphoma is closely associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the main cause of infectious mononucleosis. The North American form of Burkitt lymphoma is not linked to EBV.
Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in males."
1894,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Burkitt%27s lymphoma ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of Burkitt lymphoma.
1895,What to expect if I have Burkitt%27s lymphoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,More than half of those with Burkitt lymphoma can be cured with intensive chemotherapy. The cure rate may be lower if the cancer spreads to the bone marrow or spinal fluid.
1896,What are the symptoms of Bursitis?,"Bursitis most typically occurs in the elbow, shoulder, or hip, although it can also occur in the heel, the knee, or the base of the big toe.
Symptoms may include:
Stiff and aching joint Swollen and red joint Increased pain when the joint is pressed on or manipulated"
1897,What causes Bursitis?,"A bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between a bone and other moving parts: muscles, tendons, or skin. Bursae are found throughout the body. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed (redness and increased fluid in the bursa).
Injuries, overuse, and repetitive stress are common causes of bursitis. Certain diseases, such as arthritis and gout, might also cause it. Bursitis is also commonly caused by direct trauma to a joint. Bursitis may occur at the knee or elbow, from kneeling or leaning on the elbows longer than usual on a hard surface, for example. It occurs more often with age."
1898,Who is at highest risk for Bursitis ?,"Factors that increase your risk for developing bursitis include:
Middle age Diabetes Rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis Thyroid disease Gout Having a hobby or job that involves repetitive motions such as bicycling, playing baseball, gardening, or setting tiles."
1899,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bursitis ?,"Call your doctor to schedule and appointment if:
Joint pain significantly interferes with your daily activities Joint pain lasts over two weeks Joint is extremely swollen Joint is red or bruised, or there is a rash on the joint You experience piercing pain when you partake in physical activity You develop a fever"
1900,What to expect if I have Bursitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook is generally very good for bursitis, although in rare cases your bursa may have to be removed surgically if other treatments are ineffective."
1901,What are the symptoms of Byssinosis?,"Chest tightness Cough Wheezing
Symptoms will get worse at the beginning of the work week, and then improve while you are away from the workplace, or later in the work week."
1902,What causes Byssinosis?,"Breathing in the dust produced by raw cotton can cause byssinosis. It is most common in people who work in the textile industry. Those who are sensitive to the dust can have an asthma -like condition after being exposed. In those with asthma, being exposed to the dust makes breathing more difficult, but in byssinosis, the symptoms usually go away by the end of the work week. After long periods of exposure, symptoms can continue throughout the week without improving.
Methods of prevention in the U.S. have reduced the number of cases, but byssinosis is still common in developing countries."
1903,Who is at highest risk for Byssinosis ?,People who work in the textile industry are at risk due to their exposure to dust. Being exposed to the dust many times can lead to chronic lung disease and shortness of breath or wheezing. Smoking increases the risk for this disease.
1904,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Byssinosis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of byssinosis.
1905,What to expect if I have Byssinosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Symptoms usually improve after stopping exposure to the dust. Continued exposure can lead to damaged lung function. In the U.S., worker's compensation may be available to people with byssinosis."
1906,What are the symptoms of Campylobacteriosis ?,"Symptoms start 2 - 4 days after being exposed to the bacteria. They usually last 1 week, and may include
Cramping abdominal pain Fever Nausea and vomiting Watery diarrhea, sometimes bloody"
1907,What are the causes of Campylobacteriosis ?,"Campylobacter enteritis is a common cause of intestinal infection. These bacteria are also one of the many causes of traveler's diarrhea or food poisoning.
People most often get infected by eating or drinking food or water, often raw poultry, fresh produce, or unpasteurized milk.
A person can also be infected by close contact with infected people or animals."
1908,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Campylobacteriosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have diarrhea that continues for more than 1 week or comes back. There is pus or blood in your stools. You have diarrhea and are unable to drink fluids due to nausea or vomiting. You have a fever above 101°F, or your child has a fever above 100.4°F along with diarrhea. You have signs of dehydration (thirst, dizziness, light-headedness) You have recently traveled to a foreign country and developed diarrhea. Your diarrhea does not get better in 5 days (2 days for an infant or child), or gets worse Your child has been vomiting for more than 12 hours (in a newborn under 3 months you should call as soon as vomiting or diarrhea begins)"
1909,What are the symptoms of Carcinoma of the penis?,"Genital lesions on the penis Painless sore on penis (occasionally, the lesion may cause pain) Penis pain and bleeding from the penis (may occur with advanced disease)"
1910,What causes Carcinoma of the penis?,"The exact cause is unknown.
Smegma, a cheese-like, foul-smelling substance found under the foreskin of the penis may increase the risk of penis cancer.
Uncircumcised men who do not keep the area under the foreskin clean and men with a history of genital warts or human papillomavirus (HPV) are at higher risk for this rare disorder."
1911,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Carcinoma of the penis ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of penis cancer develop.
1912,What to expect if I have Carcinoma of the penis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome can be good with early diagnosis and treatment. The 5-year survival rate for penile cancers is 65%. Urination and sexual function can often be maintained even when a significant portion of the penis is removed.
1913,What are the symptoms of Carpal tunnel syndrome?,"Symptoms usually start gradually, with pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm. As symptoms worsen, people might feel tingling during the day, and decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. A sharp, piercing pain may shoot through the wrist and up your arm.
Patients often report:
Weak grip or difficulty carrying bags Numbness or tingling in the thumb and next two or three fingers of one or both hands Numbness or tingling of the palm of the hand Pain extending to the elbow Pain in the wrist or hand in one or both hands Problems with fine finger movements (coordination) in one or both hands Wasting away of the muscle under the thumb (in advanced or long-term cases) Weakness in one or both hands"
1914,What causes Carpal tunnel syndrome?,"The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway of ligament and bones at the base of your hand that contains nerves and tendons. Sometimes, thickening from irritated tendons or other swelling narrows the tunnel and causes the nerve to be compressed, putting pressure on the median nerve. The median nerve provides feeling and movement to the ""thumb side"" of the hand (the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and thumb side of the ring finger).
In some cases no direct cause of the syndrome can be identified. Most likely the disorder is due to a congenital predisposition - some people have smaller carpal tunnels than other people do. Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in people who perform repetitive motions of the hand and wrist.
Typing on a computer keyboard is probably the most common cause of carpal tunnel. Other causes include:
performing assembly line work Sewing Driving Assembly line work Painting Writing Use of tools (especially hand tools or tools that vibrate) Sports such as racquetball or handball Playing some musical instruments
Other causes include wrist injury, or swelling due to certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. A number of medical problems are associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, including:
Bone fractures and arthritis of the wrist Acromegaly Diabetes Alcoholism Hypothyroidism Kidney failure and dialysis Menopause, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and pregnancy Infections Obesity Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Scleroderma"
1915,Who is at highest risk for Carpal tunnel syndrome ?,"Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men. Additionally, those who perform assembly line work are especially at risk."
1916,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Carpal tunnel syndrome ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome Your symptoms do not respond to regular treatment, such as rest and anti-inflammatory medications, or if there seems to be a loss of muscle mass in your fingers"
1917,What to expect if I have Carpal tunnel syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Symptoms often improve with treatment, but more than 50% of cases eventually require surgery. Surgery is often successful, but full healing can take months.
Recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome following treatment is rare. The majority of patients recover completely."
1918,What are the symptoms of Cat scratch fever?,"A person who has had contact with a cat may show common symptoms, including:
Bump (papule) or blister (pustule) at site of injury (usually the first sign) Fatigue Fever (in some patients) Headache Lymph node swelling near the scratch or bite Overall discomfort (malaise)
Less common symptoms may include:
Draining lymph nodes' Enlarged spleen Loss of appetite Sore throat Weight loss"
1919,What causes Cat scratch fever?,"Cat scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae. The disease is spread through contact with an infected cat (a bite or scratch), or contact with cat saliva on broken skin or the white of the eye. About 2 - 3 weeks after becoming infected, lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy) occurs near the site of the scratch or bite. Occasionally, an infected lymph node may form a tunnel (fistula) through the skin and drain (leak fluid). Cat scratch disease is a common cause of chronic swollen lymph nodes in children."
1920,Who is at highest risk for Cat scratch fever ?,People having cats as pet at are higher risk of getting the disease.
1921,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cat scratch fever ?,Call your health care provider if you have enlarged lymph nodes and a history of exposure to a cat.
1922,What to expect if I have Cat scratch fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In children with normal immune systems, full recovery without treatment is the norm. In immunocompromised people, treatment with antibiotics generally leads to recovery."
1923,What are the symptoms of a cataract?,"Visual problems may include the following changes:
Cloudy, blurry, fuzzy, foggy, or filmy vision Loss of color intensity Double vision or multiple images in one eye Difficulty seeing at night Problems seeing shapes against a background or the difference between shades of colors Seeing halos around lights Being sensitive to glare
Cataracts generally lead to decreased vision, even in daylight. Most people with cataracts have similar changes in both eyes, although one eye may be worse than the other. Many people with this condition have only mild vision changes.
Other symptoms may include:
Frequent changes in eyeglass prescription"
1924,What causes Cataract?,"In many cases, the cause of cataract development is unknown. Adult cataracts usually develop very gradually with advancing age and may run in families. They develop slowly and painlessly, and vision in the affected eye or eyes slowly gets worse. Some researchers suspect that a cataract may form as the protein in the lens changes from the wear and tear it takes over the years
Although most cataracts are related to aging, there are other types and causes of cataract:
Secondary cataract: Cataracts can form after surgery for other eye problems, such as glaucoma. Cataracts also can develop in people who have other health problems, such as diabetes. Cataracts are sometimes linked to use of corticosteroids and certain other medications, such as cortisone. Traumatic cataract: Cataracts can develop after an eye injury, sometimes years later. Congenital cataract Some babies are born with cataracts or develop them in childhood, often in both eyes. These cataracts may be so small that they do not affect vision. If they do, the lenses may need to be removed. Radiation cataract: Cataracts can develop after exposure to some types of radiation.
Cataracts develop more quickly if there are some environmental factors, such as smoking, exposure to other toxic substances, and exposure to excessive ultraviolet light or sunlight."
1925,Who is at highest risk for Cataract ?,"The risk of cataract increases as you get older. Other risk factors for cataract include:
Certain diseases such as diabetes. Personal behavior such as smoking and alcohol use. The environment such as prolonged exposure to UV light and sunlight."
1926,What to expect if I have Cataract  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Vision may not improve to 20/20 after cataract surgery if other eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, are present. Eye doctors can usually, but not always, determine this in advance."
1927,What are the Symptoms of Celiac Disease?,"Symptoms of celiac disease vary from person to person. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system or in other parts of the body. Digestive symptoms are more common in infants and young children and may include:
Abdominal bloating and pain Chronic diarrhea Vomiting Constipation Pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool Weight loss Irritability is another common symptom in children. Malabsorption of nutrients during the years when nutrition is critical to a child’s normal growth and development can result in other problems, such as failure to thrive in infants, delayed growth and short stature, delayed puberty, and dental enamel defects of the permanent teeth.
Adults are less likely to have digestive symptoms and may have one or more of the following, instead:
Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia Fatigue Bone or joint pain Arthritis Bone loss or osteoporosis Depression or anxiety Tingling or numbness in the hands and feet Seizures Missed menstrual periods Infertility or recurrent miscarriage Canker sores inside the mouth An itchy skin rash, called dermatitis herpetiformis"
1928,What Causes Celiac Disease?,"Celiac disease may be due to the following causes:
Gluten allergy Inflammation of the bowel tissue Genetic mutations"
1929,Who is at highest risk for Celiac disease ?,"People with celiac disease tend to have other diseases, in which the immune system attacks the body’s healthy cells and tissues. The connection between celiac disease and these diseases may be genetic background. They include:
Type 1 diabetes Autoimmune thyroid disease Autoimmune liver disease Rheumatoid arthritis Addison’s disease, a condition in which the glands that produce critical hormones are damaged Sjögren’s syndrome, a condition in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed"
1930,Where to find Medical Care for Celiac Disease?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Celiac Disease
1931,What to expect if I have Celiac disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Celiac disease is an incurable and chronic condition. Symptomatic onset may occur at any point during a patient's life and is a lifelong condition. Although incurable, celiac disease is manageable, if the necessary precautions and dietary guidelines are followed. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only known way to treat celiac disease. Prognosis of celiac disease is good with gluten-free diet. Full recovery occurs within few months."
1932,What are the symptoms of Central pontine myelinolysis?,"Confusion, delirium Balance problems Difficulty swallowing Hallucinations Reduced alertness, drowsiness or sleepiness, lethargy, poor responses Speech changes, poor enunciation Tremor Weakness in the face, arms, or legs, usually affecting both sides of the body"
1933,What causes Central pontine myelinolysis?,"The destruction of the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells prevents signals from being properly transmitted in the nerve. This decreases the nerve's ability to communicate with other cells.
The most common cause of central pontine myelinolysis is a quick rise in the body's sodium levels. This most often occurs when someone is being treated for low blood levels of sodium (hyponatremia) and the levels rise too fast. It also can occasionally occur when high levels of sodium in the body (hypernatremia) are corrected too quickly.
This condition does not occur on its own. It is a complication of treatment for other conditions or from the other conditions themselves."
1934,Who is at highest risk for Central pontine myelinolysis ?,"Risks include:
Alcoholism Liver disease Malnutrition from serious illnesses"
1935,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Central pontine myelinolysis ?,"There is no real guideline on when to seek medical attention, because this condition is rare in the general community."
1936,What to expect if I have Central pontine myelinolysis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The nerve damage caused by central pontine myelinolysis is usually long-lasting.
The disorder can cause serious long-term (chronic) disability."
1937,What are the symptoms of Cerebral arteriovenous malformation?,"Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Hemorrhages occur most often in people ages 15 - 20, but can also occur later in life. Some patients with an AVM also have cerebral aneurysms. In about half of patiens with AVMs, the first symptoms are those of a stroke caused by bleeding into the brain.Cerebral AVMs occur in less than 1% of people.
Symptoms of an AVM that has not bled include: Confusion
Ear noise/buzzing (also called pulsatile tinnitus) Headache May be in one area (localized) or the entire head May resemble a migraine headache in some cases Problems walking Seizures of all types and severity Symptoms caused by pressure on one area of the brain Blurred, decreased, or double vision Dizziness Muscle weakness in any part of the body or face Numbness in any part of the body"
1938,What are the causes of Cerebral arteriovenous malformation?,"The cause of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is unknown. The condition occurs when arteries in the brain connect directly to nearby veins without having the normal vessels (capillaries) between them.
Arteriovenous malformations vary in size and location in the brain.
An AVM rupture occurs because of pressure and damage to blood vessel tissue. This allows blood to leak into the brain or surrounding tissues, and reduces blood flow to the brain."
1939,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cerebral arteriovenous malformation ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have:
Numbness in parts of the body Seizures Severe headache Vomiting Weakness Other symptoms of a ruptured AVM
Also seek medical attention if you have a first-time seizure, because AVM may be the cause of seizures."
1940,What to expect if I have Cerebral arteriovenous malformation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"About 10% of cases in which excess bleeding (hemorrhage) is the first symptom are deadly. Some patients may have permanent seizures and brain and nervous system (neurological) problems.
AVMs that do not cause symptoms by the time people reach their late 40s or early 50s are more likely to remain stable and rarely cause symptoms."
1941,What are the symptoms of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ?,"The most common symptoms of cerebral venous thrombosis are
- headache, subacute in nature,developing over several days. Acute headaches also can happen.
- focal or generalized seizure
- papilledema
- focal neurological deficits presenting as monoparesis or hemiparesis
- coma in 10% of patients as the presenting symptom"
1942,What causes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis?,"- multiple pregnancies,
- untreated inflammatory conditions
- infections and injuries of the central nervous system
- venous thromboembolism,
- pregnancy
- oestrogen therapy/ oral contraceptives,
- thrombophilia (especially antithrombin deficiency, protein C and S deficiency and factor V Leiden mutation),
- hypercoagulability
- head trauma,
- local infections
- underlying cancer"
1943,Who is at highest risk for Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ?,"- surgery
- trauma
- pregnancy
- puerperium
- antiphospholipid syndrome
- cancer
- exogenous hormones
- genetic risks (inherited thrombophilia)"
1944,What to expect if I have Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Comparing to other types of stroke, the prognosis of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is more favorable. In 80% of patients with CVT, there are no functional disabilities. In the acute phase of CVT 5-10% of patients die. A significant number of patients suffer from chronic complications as headache, fatigue, memory and concentration deficits, or residual epilepsy."
1945,What are the symptoms of Cervical cancer?,"Early cervical cancers usually do not cause symptoms. When cancer grows larger, women may notice one or more of these symptoms:
Abnormal vaginal bleeding Bleeding that occurs between regular menstrual periods Bleeding after sexual intercourse, douching, or a pelvic exam Menstrual periods that last longer and are heavier than before Bleeding after going through menopause
Increased vaginal discharge Pelvic pain Pain during sex
Infection s or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A woman with any of these symptoms should tell her doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
1946,Who is at highest risk for Cervical cancer ?,"Studies have found a number of factors that may increase the risk of cervical cancer, infection with HPV (human papillomavirus) is the main cause of cervical cancer. HPV infection and other risk factors may act together to increase the risk even more:
HPV Infection:
HPV is a group of viruses that can infect the cervix. An HPV infection that doesn't go away can cause cervical cancer in some women. HPV is the cause of nearly all cervical cancers. These viruses are passed from person to person through sexual contact or skin to skin contact.
Most adults have been infected with HPV at some time in their lives, but most infections clear up on their own. Some types of HPV can cause changes to cells in the cervix. If these changes are found early, cervical cancer can be prevented by removing or killing the changed cells before they can become cancer cells. A vaccine for females ages 9 to 26 protects against two types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer.
Lack of Regular Pap Test:
Cervical cancer is more common among women who don't have regular Pap test s. The Pap test helps doctors find abnormal cells. Removing or killing abnormal cells usually prevents cervical cancer.
Smoking:
Among women who are infected with HPV, smoking cigarettes slightly increases the risk of cervical cancer.
Weakened Immune System:
Infection with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) or taking drugs that suppress the immune system increases the risk of cervical cancer.
Sexual History:
Women who have had many sexual partners have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Also, a woman who has had sex with a man who has had many sexual partners may be at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. In both cases, the risk of developing cervical cancer is higher because these women have a higher risk of HPV infection.
Using Birth Control Pills for a Long Time:
Using birth control pills for a long time (5 or more years) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection. However, the risk decreases quickly when women stop using birth control pills.
Having Many Children:
Studies suggest that giving birth to many children (5 or more) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection.
DES (diethylstilbestrol):
DES may increase the risk of a rare form of cervical cancer in daughters exposed to this drug before birth. DES was given to some pregnant women in the United States between about 1940 and 1971. (It is no longer given to pregnant women.)"
1947,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cervical cancer ?,"You should start getting regular Pap test s at age 21, or within three years of the first time you have sex, which ever happens first. The Pap test is one of the most reliable and effective cancer screening tests available, it also can find other conditions that might need treatment, such as infection or inflammation. In addition to the Pap test; the main test for cervical cancer, the HPV test may be used for screening women aged 30 years and older, or women of any age who have unclear Pap test results. If you are 30 or older, and your screening tests are normal, your chance of getting cervical cancer in the next few years is very low. For that reason, your doctor may tell you that you will not need another screening test for up to three years. But you should still go to the doctor regularly for a check-up that may include a pelvic exam. It also is important for you to continue getting a Pap test regularly, even if you think you are too old to have a child, or are not having sex anymore."
1948,What to expect if I have Cervical cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"It's important for you to take care of yourself by eating well and staying as active as you can during the sometimes rough treatment of cervical cancer. You need the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy. However, you may not feel like eating during or soon after treatment. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of treatment (such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, or mouth sores) can make it hard to eat well. Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to cope with these problems. Research shows that people with cancer feel better when they stay active. Walking, yoga, swimming, and other activities can keep you strong and increase your energy. Exercise may reduce nausea and pain and make treatment easier to handle. It also can help relieve stress. Whatever physical activity you choose, be sure to talk to your doctor before you start. You'll need regular checkups after treatment for cervical cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems with checkups, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will check for the return of cancer. Even when cancer seems to have been completely removed or destroyed, the disease sometimes returns because undetected cancer cells remained somewhere in the body after treatment. Checkups may include a physical exam, Pap tests, and chest x-rays."
1949,What are the symptoms of Cervicitis?,"Abnormal vaginal bleeding After intercourse After menopause Between periods Unusual vaginal discharge Does not go away Gray, white, or yellow color May have an odor Painful sexual intercourse Pain in the vagina Pressure or heaviness in the pelvis
Note: There may be no symptoms, so it is recommended that certain women be tested for chlamydia, even if they do not have symptoms."
1950,What causes Cervicitis?,"Cervicitis is most often caused by an infection, usually caught during sexual activity. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that can cause cervicitis include:
Chlamydia Gonorrhea Herpes virus (genital herpes) Human papilloma virus (genital warts) Trichomoniasis
However, in a few cases it may be due to:
A device inserted into the pelvic area such as: Cervical cap Device to support the uterus (pessary) Diaphragm An allergy to spermicides used for birth control or to latex in condoms Exposure to a chemical"
1951,Who is at highest risk for Cervicitis ?,"Cervicitis is very common, affecting more than half of all women at some point during their adult life. Risks include:
High-risk sexual behavior History of STDs Many sexual partners Sex (intercourse) at an early age Sexual partners who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STD Bacteria (such as staphylococcus and streptococcus) and too much growth of normal bacteria in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) can also cause cervicitis."
1952,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cervicitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of cervicitis.
1953,What to expect if I have Cervicitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Simple cervicitis usually heals with treatment if the cause is found and there is a treatment for that cause.
1954,What causes chancroid?,Chancroid is caused by a bacterium called Haemophilus ducreyi. H. ducreyi is usually found in developing countries but may also be found in endemic areas in devloped countries associated with crack cocaine use and prostitution. H. ducreyi is typically transmitted through sexual intercourse.
1955,What are the symptoms of chancroid?,"Patients can develop chancroid more than once on subsequent exposures to H. ducreyi. Symptoms start to appear 4 to 10 days after exposure to H. ducreyi. Symptoms of chancroid may include:
Red bumps called papules Ulcers Swollen inguinal lymph nodes (these are lymph nodes located in the fold between the leg and lower abdomen) Pain with urination and intercourse in females"
1956,What are the symptoms of Chemical pneumonitis?,"Acute:
Air hunger (feeling that you cannot get enough air) Cough Difficulty breathing Possibly wet or gurgle sounding breathing (abnormal lung sounds) Unusual sensation (possibly burning feeling) in the chest
Chronic:
Cough may or may not occur Progressive disability (related to shortness of breath Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Shortness of breath with only mild exercise"
1957,What causes Chemical pneumonitis?,"Many household and industrial chemicals are capable of producing both an acute and a chronic form of inflammation in the lungs. Some of the most common dangerous, inhaled substances include:
Chlorine gas (during use of cleaning materials such as chlorine bleach, in industrial accidents, or near swimming pools) Grain and fertilizer dust Noxious fumes from pesticides Smoke (from house fires and wildfires)
Chronic chemical pneumonitis can occur after only low levels of exposure to the irritant over extended periods of time. This causes inflammation and may lead to stiffness of the lungs, which decreases the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body. Unchecked, this condition may ultimately lead to respiratory failure and death. Chronic aspiration of acid from the stomach can also lead to chemical pneumonitis."
1958,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chemical pneumonitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have trouble breathing after inhaling (or possibly inhaling) any substance.
1959,What to expect if I have Chemical pneumonitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on the chemical agent involved, the severity of exposure, and whether the problem is acute or chronic."
1960,What are the symptoms of Chickenpox?,"Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears: Fever Headache Loss of appetite Fatigue Malaise
The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. The average child develops 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin.
The blisters are usually first seen on the face, chest, back, scalp and then to the rest of the body associated with intense itch.
After one or two days, the blisters become cloudy and form scabs. The newly formed blisters occur in groups. They are usually seen on the eyelids, in the mouth and in the vagina.
Numerous blisters are observed in children suffering from eczema.
Scars are usually not formed unless the pox is infected with bacteria from scratching.
Despite receiving a vaccine, some children may still develop a mild case of chickenpox. Recovery is usually much quicker and they are left with only a few pox (fewer than 30). Such cases are often harder to diagnose. These children can still spread chickenpox to others."
1961,What causes Chickenpox?,"In children, chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus of Herpes virus family. The same virus also causes herpes zoster (shingles) in adults.
Chickenpox spreads easily to others by touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister, or if someone with chickenpox in the vicinity coughs or sneezes. People with mild illness may be contagious.
An individual with chickenpox is contagious one to two days even before the blisters appear. Infected individuals remain contagious until all the blisters have turned into crusts.
Most cases of chickenpox are observed in children younger than ten years old. The disease is usually mild, although serious complications sometimes occur. Older children and adolescents usually get sicker than younger children.
Children born to mothers who have had chickenpox or who have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to get chickenpox before they are 1 year old. If in case the children get chickenpox, it's often a mild form. The reason for this would be the antibodies from their mother's blood help protect the children. Children under 1-year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox in their lifetime or if they hadn't received the vaccination against chickenpox can get severe chickenpox.
Suffering from illness or the use of medications such as in chemotherapy and the use of steroids may lead severe chickenpox symptoms more commonly in children whose immune system is compromised."
1962,Who is at highest risk for Chickenpox ?,"As chickenpox is contagious, anyone in close proximity to someone with the disease is at risk."
1963,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chickenpox ?,Call your health care provider or visit your nearest hospital if you think that your child has chickenpox or if your child is over 12 months of age and has not been vaccinated against chickenpox.
1964,What to expect if I have Chickenpox  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Usually, a person recovers without complications.
Once you have had chickenpox, the virus usually remains dormant or asleep in your body for your lifetime. About 1 in 10 adults will have shingles when the virus reemerges during a period of stress."
1965,What are the symptoms of Chikungunya?,"Most people infected with Chikungunya virus will develop some symptoms. Symptoms usually begin 3–7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Chikungunya disease does not often result in death, but the symptoms can be severe and disabling. Most patients feel better within a week. In some people, the joint pain may persist for months."
1966,What causes Chikungunya?,Chikungunya virus is transmitted to people through mosquito bites. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person already infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites. Chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. These are the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus. They bite mostly during the daytime.
1967,Who is at highest risk for Chikungunya ?,"People at risk for more severe disease include newborns infected around the time of birth, older adults (≥65 years), and people with medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Travelers who visit the following Caribbean countries are at risk of getting Chikungunya.
Anguilla Antigua British Virgin Islands Dominica Dominican Republic French Guiana Guadeloupe Guyana Haiti Martinique Puerto Rico Saint Barthelemy Saint Kitts Saint Lucia Saint Martin (French) Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Sint Maarten (Dutch)
In addition, travelers to Africa, Asia, and islands in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific are also at risk, as the virus is present in many of these areas. The mosquito that carries Chikungunya virus can bite during the day and night, both indoors and outdoors, and often lives around buildings in urban areas."
1968,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chikungunya ?,"See your doctor if you develop any of the following symptoms:
Fever persisting for more than five days Intractable pain Postural dizziness, cold extremities Decreased urine output Any bleeding under the skin or through any orifice Incessant vomiting"
1969,What to expect if I have Chikungunya  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Often symptoms in infected individuals are mild and the infection may go unrecognized, or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue occurs. Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections."
1970,What are the symptoms of Childhood disintegrative disorder?,Delay or lack of spoken language Impairment in nonverbal behaviors Inability to start or maintain a conversation Lack of play Loss of bowel and bladder control Loss of language or communication skills Loss of motor skills Loss of social skills Problems forming relationships with other children and family members

1978,What causes Cholangiocarcinoma?,"Cancerous tumors of the bile ducts are usually slow-growing and do not spread (metastasize) quickly. However, many of these tumors are already advanced by the time they are found.
A cholangiocarcinoma may start anywhere along the bile ducts. These tumors block off the bile ducts.
They affect both men and women. Most patients are older than 65.
Risks for this condition include:
Bile duct (choledochal) cysts Chronic biliary irritation History of infection with the parasitic worm, liver flukes Primary sclerosing cholangitis Ulcerative colitis
Cholangiocarcinoma is rare. It occurs in approximately 2 out of 100,000 people."
1979,Who is at highest risk for Cholangiocarcinoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of cholangiocarcinoma is related to several factors.
Chronic inflammation of the bile duct: Clinical data suggest patients who have chronic inflammation of the bile duct such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis, bile duct stones, choledochal cysts and cirrhosis have high risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
Liver fluke infections: Liver fluke infection is a major cause of cholangiocarcinoma in some Asian countries.
Exposure to thorotrast: Thorotrast, widely used as a contrast agent for x-rays until 1950s, was found to lead to hepatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.
Obesity: Epidemiological survey show being overweight or obese can increase the risk of developing cancers of cholangiocarcinoma.
Age: Clinical data show old people are more likely to developing cholangiocarcinoma."

Pain or discomfort in both breasts The pain commonly comes and goes with the period, but can last through the whole month Breasts that feel full, swollen, and heavy Pain or discomfort under the arms Thick or lumpy breasts You may have a lump in the same area of the breast that becomes larger before each period and shrinks afterward. This type of lump moves when it is pushed with your fingers. It does not feel stuck or fixed to the tissue around it. This lump is common with fibrocystic breasts.
You may have discharge from the nipple. If the discharge is clear, red, or bloody, talk to your health care provider right away."
2024,What causes Chronic cystic mastitis ?,"The exact cause is not known. It is believed that hormones made in the ovaries can make a woman's breasts feel swollen, lumpy, or painful before or during menstruation each month.
Up to half of women have this problem at some time during their life. It is most common between the ages of 20 and 45. It is rare in women after menopause, unless they are taking estrogen.
Some women feel that eating chocolate, drinking caffeine, or eating high-fat foods cause their symptoms. But there is no clear proof of this."
2025,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic cystic mastitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You find new or different lumps during your breast self exam
You have new discharge from the nipple or any discharge that is bloody or clear
You have redness or puckering of the skin, or flattening or indentation of the nipple"
2026,What to expect if I have Chronic cystic mastitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If your breast exams and mammograms are normal, you do not need to worry about your symptoms. Fibrocystic breast changes do not increase your risk of breast cancer. Symptoms usually improve after menopause."
2027,Who is at highest risk for Chronic diarrhea ?,"The risk of serious complications from chronic diarrhea depends on the cause of the diarrhea and the age and general health of the patient. Chronic diarrhea from some causes can result in serious nutritional disorders and malnutrition. Severely immunocompromised persons, including those with HIV/AIDS and those receiving chemotherapy for cancer or organ transplantation can be at risk for serious chronic diarrhea. Determining the correct cause of chronic diarrhea is necessary in order to select proper treatment and reduce the risk of serious complications."
2028,How are infections that can cause chronic diarrhea spread?,"Infections that can cause chronic diarrhea usually are spread by ingesting food or water or touching objects contaminated with stool. In general, chronic diarrhea not caused by an infection is not spread to other people."
2029,What are the symptoms of Chronic fatigue syndrome?,"Symptoms of CFS are similar to those of the flu and other common viral infections, and include muscle aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. However, symptoms of CFS last for 6 months or more.
The main symptom of CFS is extreme tiredness (fatigue), which is:
New Lasts at least 6 months Not relieved by bed rest Severe enough to keep you from participating in certain activities
Other symptoms include:
Feeling extremely tired for more than 24 hours after exercise that would normally be considered easy Feeling unrefreshed after sleeping for a proper amount of time Forgetfulness Concentration problems Confusion Joint pain but no swelling or redness Headaches that differ from those you have had in the past Irritability Mild fever (101 degrees F or less) Muscle aches (myalgias) Muscle weakness, all over or multiple locations, not explained by any known disorder Sore throat Sore lymph nodes in the neck or under the arms"
2030,What causes Chronic fatigue syndrome?,"The exact cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is unknown.
Some theories suggest CFS may be due to:
Epstein-Barr virus or human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6); however, no specific virus has been identified as the cause Inflammation in the nervous system, because of a faulty immune system response
The following may also play a role in the development of CFS:
Age Previous illnesses Stress Genetics Environmental factors
CFS most commonly occurs in women ages 30 to 50."
2031,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic fatigue syndrome ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you experience persistent, severe fatigue, with or without other symptoms of this disorder.
Other more serious disorders can cause similar symptoms and should be ruled out."
2032,What to expect if I have Chronic fatigue syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The long-term outlook for patients with CFS varies and is difficult to predict when symptoms first start.
Some patients completely recover after 6 months to a year.
Some patients never feel like they did before they developed CFS. Studies suggest that you are more likely to get better if you receive extensive rehabilitation."
2033,What are the symptoms of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ?,"Early chronic lymphocytic leukemia does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Weakness and fatigue Weight loss Fever and infection Night sweats Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, or groin Pain or fullness below the ribs
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2034,Who is at highest risk for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is related to several factors.
Certain chemical exposures: Studies suggest that some herbicides and insecticides used in farming may increase the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Family history: Epidemic survey show that first-degree relatives of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients have an increased risk for this cancer.
Gender: Clinical data show chronic lymphocytic leukemia is more common in men than women.
Race: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is more common in North America and Europe than in Asia."

Hyperpyrexia Severe infection Severe abdominal pain"
2036,What to expect if I have Chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia depends on:
The stage of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whether lymphocytes are spread throughout the bone marrow, whether the chronic lymphocytic leukemia progresses to lymphoma or prolymphocytic leukemia.
Treatment response: Whether the chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient gets better with treatment or has come back.
The patient's general health."
2037,What are the symptoms of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Symptoms of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include: cough with mucus, shortness of breath (dyspnea) that gets worse with mild activity, fatigue, frequent respiratory infections, and wheezing. Since the symptoms of COPD develop slowly, some people may be unaware that they are sick."
2038,What causes Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. The more a person smokes, the more likely that person will develop COPD although some people smoke for years and never get COPD.
In rare cases, nonsmokers who lack a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin can develop emphysema."
2039,Who is at highest risk for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ?,"Risk factors for COPD are:

2040,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ?,Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a rapid increase in shortness of breath.
2041,What to expect if I have Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"This condition is a long-term (chronic) illness. The disease will get worse more quickly if one continues to smoke.
Patients with severe COPD will be short of breath with most activities and will be admitted to the hospital more often. These patients should talk with their doctor about the use of breathing machines and end-of-life care."
2042,What are the symptoms of Chronic tic disorder?,"Symptoms include:
Excessive blinking Grimaces of the face Quick movements of the arms, legs, or other areas Sounds (grunts, throat clearing, contractions of the abdomen or diaphragm)
People can hold off these symptoms for a short period of time, but they feel a sense of relief when they carry out these movements. Patients typically describe them as responding to an inner urge and may have abnormal sensations in the area of the tic prior to the tic occurring.
Tics may continue during all stages of sleep. They may get worse with:
Excitement Fatigue Heat Stress"
2043,What causes Chronic tic disorder?,"About 1 to 2% of the population has chronic motor tic disorder.

Chronic tics may be forms of Tourette syndrome."
2044,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic tic disorder ?,"There is usually no need to see the health care provider for a tic unless it is severe or disrupts your life.
If you cannot tell whether your movements are a tic or something more serious (such as a seizure), call your health care provider."
2045,What to expect if I have Chronic tic disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Children who develop this disorder between ages 6 and 8 usually do very well. Symptoms may last 4 to 6 years, and then stop without treatment in early adolescence.
When the disorder begins in older children and continues into the 20s, it may become a life-long condition"
2046,What causes Churg-Strauss syndrome?,"There are no established causes for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, various allergens, infections, vaccinations and drugs may act as a triggering agents, and are responsible for developing disease. Genetics may also play a role."
2047,Who is at highest risk for Churg-Strauss syndrome ?,"Any one can develop eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Studies shown, it occurs mostly between 40-60 years with people having chronic history of asthma and allergic manifestations."

Worsening asthma Severe breathing difficulties Worsening sinusitis, facial pain and rhinitis Severe abdominal pain Blood in urine severe urticarial rash
The above symptoms may also present in association with other diseases, but they have to be evaluated properly by medical professional."
2049,What to expect if I have Churg-Strauss syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, people with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis can die within a few months.
With treatment, the outlook for most patients is good. Studies have shown that most people who receive and cyclophosphamide are doing much better. However, the disease relapses are common."
2050,What are the symptoms of Depression?,"Symptoms of depression include:
Low or irritable mood most of the time A loss of pleasure in usual activities Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much A big change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss Tiredness and lack of energy Feelings of worthlessness, self-hate, and guilt Difficulty concentrating Slow or fast movements Lack of activity and avoiding usual activities Feeling hopeless or helpless Repeated thoughts of death or suicide
Low self-esteem is common with depression. It is also common to have sudden bursts of anger and a lack of pleasure from activities that normally make you happy, including sex.
Depressed children may not have the same symptoms as adult depression. Watch for changes in school work, sleep, and behavior. If you wonder whether your child might be depressed, it's worth talking to a health care provider."
2051,What causes Depression?,"Depression often runs in families. This may be due to your genes (inherited), behaviors you learn at home, or both. Even if your genes make you more likely to develop depression, a stressful or unhappy life event usually triggers the depression.
Many factors can cause depression, including:
Alcohol or drug abuse
Medical conditions and treatments, such as: Certain types of cancer Long-term pain Sleeping problems Steroid medications Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Stressful life events, such as: Abuse or neglect Breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend Certain types of cancer Death of a relative or friend Divorce, including a parent's divorce Failing a class Illness in the family Job loss Long-term pain Social isolation (common cause of depression in the elderly)"
2052,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Clinical depression ?,"Call 911, a suicide hotline, or go to a nearby emergency room if you have thoughts of harming yourself or others.
Call your doctor if:
You hear voices that are not there You cry often without cause Your depression has affected your work, school, or family life for longer than 2 weeks You have three or more symptoms of depression You think one of your current medications may be making you feel depressed. DO NOT change or stop taking any medications without talking to your doctor You think you should cut back on drinking, a family member or friend has asked you to cut back, you feel guilty about the amount of alcohol you drink, or you drink alcohol first thing in the morning"
2053,What are the symptoms of Clostridium?,"Symptoms-
Frequent, watery diarrhea (may be 3-4 in mild diseases and can go up to 15 in severe infection) Abdominal pain Decrease appetite Low-grade fever Blood or pus in the stool Sepsis(infection that spreads through the blood) or a perforation (a hole) in the intestines."
2054,What causes Clostridium?,"Most people will never have any problems with C. diff, but in case the balance is hampered the bacteria start to release toxins that attack the lining of the intestines. This is what leads to symptoms of C. diff. infection."
2055,Who is at highest risk for Clostridium ?,"Kids, immunocompromised patients are at highest risks"
2056,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Clostridium ?,Call your doctor if your symptoms begin after you started taking an antibiotic. Also call if you have symptoms that last longer than three days or get worse

2058,What are the symptoms of Coccidioidomycosis?,"Most people with this infection never have symptoms. Others may have cold- or flu -like symptoms or symptoms of pneumonia. If symptoms occur, they typically start 5 to 21 days after being exposed to the fungus. They include:
Change in mental status Chest pain (can vary from mild to severe) Cough, possibly producing blood Fever Headache Joint stiffness and pain Loss of appetite Muscle aches Neck stiffness Night sweats Painful, red lumps on lower legs (erythema nodosum) Sensitivity to light Weight loss Wheezing Additional symptoms associated with this disease: Ankle or feet swelling Enlarged or draning lymph nodes Joint swelling"
2059,What causes Coccidioidomycosis?,"Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection most commonly seen in the desert regions of the southwestern United States, and in Central and South America. You get it by breathing in fungal particles from soil. The infection starts in the lungs. There are three forms of coccidioidomycosis: acute, chronic, or disseminated.
Acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. It almost always mild, with few or no symptoms, and goes away without treatment. The incubation period -- the time between breathing in the spores and becoming sick -- is 7 to 21 days. Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis can develop 20 or more years after initial infection. Infections (lung abscesses) can form and rupture, releasing pus (empyema) between the lungs and ribs (pleural space). Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is a widespread form of the disease. Infection spreads to other parts of the body, including the skin, brain, bones, and heart. Meningitis occurs in up to half of all people with disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Traveling to an area where the fungus is commonly seen raises your risk for this infection. You are more likely to develop a serious infection if: You are of Native American, African or Philippine descent You have a weakened immune systems due to AIDS, diabetes, or medications that suppress the immune system."
2060,Who is at highest risk for Coccidioidomycosis ?,People with decreased immunity are at increased risks.
2061,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Coccidioidomycosis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of coccidioidomycosis or if your condition does not improve with treatment.
2062,What to expect if I have Coccidioidomycosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well the person does depends on the form of the disease they have and their overall health. The outcome in acute disease is likely to be good. With treatment, the outcome is usually good for chronic or severe disease (although relapses may occur). People with disseminated disease have a high death rate."
2063,What are the symptoms of Color blindness?,"Symptoms vary from person to person, but may include:
Trouble seeing colors and the brightness of colors in the usual way Trouble telling the difference between red and green Trouble telling the difference between blue and yellow Inability to tell the difference between shades of the same or similar colors
Often, the symptoms may be so mild that some persons do not know they are color blind. A parent may notice signs of color blindness when a child is learning his or her colors.
Rapid, side-to-side eye movements and other symptoms may occur in severe cases."
2064,What causes Color blindness?,"Color blindness occurs when there is a problem with the color-sensing materials (pigments) in certain nerve cells of the eye. These cells are called cones. They are found in the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. If you are missing just one pigment, you might have trouble telling the difference between red and green. This is the most common type of color blindness. Other times, people have trouble seeing blue-yellow colors. People with blue-yellow color blindness almost always have problems identify reds and greens, too.
Color blindness is often inherited genetically. It is most commonly inherited from mutations in a X-linked recessive fashion, but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations – mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and many different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database at Johns Hopkins University).
Inherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Some of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness are:
Cone dystrophy Cone-rod dystrophy Achromatopsia (aka rod monochromatism, aka stationary cone dystrophy, aka cone dysfunction syndrome) Blue cone monochromatism Leber's congenital amaurosis Retinitis pigmentosa (initially affects rods but can later progress to cones and therefore color blindness)
Other causes of color blindness include:
Brain or retinal damage caused by shaken baby syndrome or other accidents and trauma which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe Damage to the retina caused by exposure to ultraviolet light The drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions"
2065,Who is at highest risk for Color blindness ?,"Men are at a higher risk for color blindness than women. As color blindness is commonly inherited in a X-linked recessive fashion, about 8 percent of males, but only 0.5 percent of females, are color blind in some way or another, whether it be one color, a color combination, or another mutation.   The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is because males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome being significantly shorter than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one which carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome which carries the mutation. If 5% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 5%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.05 × 0.05 = 0.0025, or just 0.25%.
In addition to those who are genetically predisposed to color blindness, people who suffer from brain or retinal damage, or who take the drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), are at an increased risk of color blindness."
2066,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Color blindness ?,"Color blindness is not considered a medical emergency.
However, make an appointment with your optometrist or ophthalmologist if you think you (or your child) have color blindness."
2067,What to expect if I have Color blindness  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Color blindness is a life-long condition. Most persons are able to adjust without difficulty or disability.
Although those who are colorblind can succeed at many jobs, they may not be able to get a job that requires color vision. For example, a pilot needs to be able to see color"
2068,What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?,"Early colorectal cancer does not make any symptoms. When the cancer grows larger, people with colorectal cancer may experience the following symptoms.
Changes in bowel habits such as diarrhea, constipation, or narrowing of the stool that lasts for more than a few days
Cramping, abdominal pain and abdominal distention
Rectal bleeding, dark stools, or blood in the stool
Weakness and fatigue
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2069,Who is at highest risk for Colorectal cancer ?,"There are some factors may increase the risk of acquiring the colorectal cancer potentially. These risk factors are outlined in the table below:
Colorectal polyps: Person with a history of adenomatous polyps (adenomas) is at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, especially with large or many of them.
Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: Clinical surveys has show the close relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.
Family history of colorectal cancer: The reasons are not clear in all cases. Inherited genes, shared environmental factors and some combination of these may contribute to the development of colorectal cancer.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): FAP is caused by changes (mutations) in the APC gene that a person inherits from his or her parents. About 1% of all colorectal cancers are due to FAP.
Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC): Clinical survey suggest that the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer in people with this condition may be as high as 70% to 80%.
Turcot syndrome: This is a rare inherited condition in which people are at increased risk of adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer.
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: People with this syndrome are at greatly increased risk for multiple kind of cancer besides colorectal cancer.
Type 2 diabetes: Clinical data show that people with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Lifestyle-related factors such as diets high in red meats and poor in vegetables and fruits, physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol abuse, obesity and so on.
Racial and ethnic background: Among all racial groups in the United States, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates to develope colorectal cancer. The reason is not yet clear.
Age: Both youth and aged can develop colorectal cancer. But the chances increase markedly after age 50."
2070,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Colorectal cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of colorectal cancer develop. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain, severe abdominal distension, and stopping defecation: The reason of a person with colorectal cancer appears these symptoms is mostly because of intestinal obstruction caused by lumps. This is the results of lumps growth on rectum wall. A surgery will be done urgently.
Defecation with a lot of blood: This is the result of cancer invading the vessels of rectum or colon walls. An abundant of blood loss may lead to shock and death. You need to go to hospital as soon as possible."
2071,What to expect if I have Colorectal cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of colorectal cancer varies widely. For patients whose tumor is caught early may often be curable. It depends on the following:
The size of the tumor
Location of the tumor in the colrectal
Whether the cancer has distant spread
Patients's general health
Whether cancer remains after initial treatment or has recurred"
2072,What are the symptoms of Common cold?,"Cold symptoms usually occur within 2-3 days after you came in contact with the virus, although it could take up to a week. Symptoms mostly affect the nose.
The most common cold symptoms are as followings:
Nasal congestion Runny nose Scratchy throat Sneezing
Adults and older children with colds generally have a low grade fever or no fever. However, young children often run a fever around 100-102°F.
Depending on the virus that caused your cold, you may also have the followings:
Cough Decreased appetite Headache Muscle aches Postnasal drip Sore throat"
2073,What causes Common cold?,"It is called “ common cold ” for good reason. There are over one billion colds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have colds more than any other types of illness. Colds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children. Children typically get up to eight colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares. Colds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons.
A cold virus would being spread through tiny air droplets, released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose.
You can catch a cold if:
A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you. You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.
The disease is most contagious for the first 2-3 days; however, not contagious after the first week."
2074,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Common cold ?,"Try to treat your cold at home first. Call your doctor if:
Breathing becomes difficult. Your symptoms get worse or do not improve after 7-10 days."
2075,What to expect if I have Common cold  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The discharge of your runny nose will become thicker, may turn to yellow or green within a few days. This is normal, and not a reason for using antibiotics. Most cold symptoms usually go away within a week. If you still feel sick after 7 days, see your doctor to rule out conditions include: sinus infection, allergies, or other medical problems."
2076,Who is at highest risk for Common cold ?,"Common cold can effect people of all age, gender, and ethnic group."
2077,What are the symptoms of Complex regional pain syndrome?,"The key symptom is pain that:
Is intense and burning, and is much stronger than would be expected for the type of injury that occurred Gets worse, rather than better over time Begins at the point of injury, but often spreads to the whole limb, or to the arm or leg on the opposite side of the body
In most cases, CRPS has three stages. However, CRPS does not always follow this pattern. Some people develop severe symptoms almost right away. Others stay in the first stage.
Stage 1 (lasts 1 - 3 months):
Changes in skin temperature, switching between warm or cold Faster growth of nails and hair Muscle spasms and joint pain Severe burning, aching pain that worsens with the slightest touch or breeze Skin that slowly becomes blotchy, purple, pale, or red; thin and shiny; swollen; more sweaty
Stage 2 (lasts 3 - 6 months):
Continued changes in the skin Nails that are cracked and break more easily Pain that is becoming worse Slower hair growth Stiff joints and weak muscles
Stage 3 (irreversible changes can be seen)
Limited movement in limb because of tightened muscles and tendons (contracture) Muscle wasting Pain in the entire limb
If pain and other symptoms are severe or long-lasting, many people may experience depression or anxiety."
2078,What causes Complex regional pain syndrome?,"Doctors aren't sure what causes CRPS. In some cases, the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the pain. Another theory is that CRPS is caused by a triggering of the immune response, which leads to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area.
CRPS has two forms:
CRPS 1 is a chronic nerve disorder that occurs most often in the arms or legs after a minor injury. CRPS 2 is caused by an injury to the nerve.
CRPS is thought to result from damage to the nervous system, including the nerves that control the blood vessels and sweat glands.
The damaged nerves are no longer able to properly control blood flow, feeling (sensation), and temperature to the affected area. This leads to medical problems in the:
Blood vessels Bones Muscles Nerves Skin
Possible causes of CRPS:
Injury directly to a nerve Injury or infection in an arm or leg
Rarely, sudden illnesses such as a heart attack or stroke can cause CSPS. The condition can sometimes appear without obvious injury to the affected limb."
2079,Who is at highest risk for Complex regional pain syndrome ?,"This condition is more common in people ages 40 - 60, but it has been seen in younger people too."
2080,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Complex regional pain syndrome ?,"Contact your health care provider if you develop constant, burning pain in an arm, leg, hand, or foot."
2081,What to expect if I have Complex regional pain syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook is better with an early diagnosis. If the doctor diagnoses the condition within the first stage, sometimes signs of the disease may disappear (remission) and normal movement is possible.
If the condition is not diagnosed quickly, changes to the bone and muscle may get worse and may not be reversible.
In some people, symptoms go away on their own. In other people, even with treatment the pain continues and the condition causes crippling, irreversible changes."
2082,What are the symptoms of Conduct disorder?,"Children with conduct disorder tend to be impulsive, hard to control, and not concerned about the feelings of other people.
Symptoms may include:
Breaking rules without obvious reason Cruel or aggressive behavior toward people or animals (for example: bullying, fighting, using dangerous weapons, forcing sexual activity, and stealing) Failure to attend school (truancy -- beginning before age 13) Heavy drinking and/or heavy illicit drug use Intentionally setting fires Lying to get a favor or avoid things they have to do Running away Vandalizing or destroying property
These children often make no effort to hide their aggressive behaviors. They may have a hard time making real friends."
2083,What causes Conduct disorder?,"Conduct disorder has been associated with:
Child abuse Drug addiction or alcoholism in the parents Family conflicts Genetic defects Poverty
The diagnosis is more common among boys.
It is hard to know how common the disorder is, because many of the qualities needed to make the diagnosis (such as defiance and rule breaking) can be hard to define. For an accurate diagnosis, the behavior must be far more extreme than simple adolescent rebellion or boyish enthusiasm.
Conduct disorder is often associated with attention-deficit disorder. Both conditions carry a risk for alcohol or other drug addiction.
Conduct disorder also can be an early sign of depression or bipolar disorder."
2084,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Conduct disorder ?,"See your health care provider if your child:
Regularly gets in trouble Has mood swings Is bullying others or cruel to animals Is being victimized Seems to be overly aggressive
Early treatment may help."
2085,What to expect if I have Conduct disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Children who have severe or frequent symptoms tend to have the poorest outlook. Expectations are also worse for those who have other illnesses, such as mood and drug abuse disorders."
2086,What are the symptoms of Congenital hypothyroidism?,"Some babies with congenital hypothyroidism do not appear any signs at birth.
Some may have one or more of the following symptoms:
Weight gain Puffy face Swollen tongue Hoarse cry Low muscle tone Cold intolerance Persistent constipation Fatigue and weakness Little to no growth Without therapy, the child later may show signs of neurological impairment."
2087,What causes Congenital hypothyroidism?,"Hypothyroidism in the newborn may be caused by:
A missing or abnormally developed thyroid gland Pituitary gland's failure to stimulate the thyroid Defective or abnormal formation of thyroid hormones
Incomplete development of the thyroid is the most common defect and occurs in about 1 out of every 3,000 births. Girls are affected twice as often than boys."
2088,Who is at highest risk for Congenital hypothyroidism ?,"Mutations in the DUOX2, PAX8, SLC5A5, TG, TPO, TSHB, and TSHR genes result in congenital hypothyroidism."
2089,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital hypothyroidism ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You feel your infant shows signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism You are pregnant and have been exposed to antithyroid drugs or procedures"
2090,What to expect if I have Congenital hypothyroidism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of congenital hypothyroidism depends on whether the baby starts thyroid hormone replacement therapy early.
The earlier the treatment begins, the better outcome the baby will be."
2091,What are the symptoms of Protein C or S deficiency?,"If you have this condition, you are more likely to develop blood clots. The symptoms are the same as for deep venous thrombosis, and include:
Pain or tenderness in the affected area Redness or swelling in the affected area"
2092,What causes Protein C or S deficiency?,"Congenital protein C or S deficiency is an inherited disorder, which means it is passed down through families. Congenital means it is present at birth.
The disorder causes abnormal blood clotting.
About 1 out of every 300 people has one normal gene and one faulty gene for protein C deficiency.
Protein S deficiency occurs in about 1 in 20,000 people."
2093,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital protein C or S deficiency ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of clotting in a vein (such as swelling and redness of the leg).
2094,What to expect if I have Congenital protein C or S deficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually good with treatment, but symptoms may return."
2095,What are the symptoms of Congenital rubella syndrome?,"Symptoms in the infant may include:
Cloudy corneas or white appearance to pupil Deafness Developmental delay Excessive sleepiness Irritability Low birth weight Mental retardation Seizures Small head size Skin rash at birth"
2096,What causes Congenital rubella syndrome?,"Congenital rubella occurs when the rubella virus in the mother affects the developing baby at a critical time, in the first 3 months of pregnancy. After the fourth month, the mother's rubella infection is less likely to harm the developing baby.
The number of babies born with congenital rubella has decreased dramatically since the introduction of the rubella vaccine.
Pregnant women who are not vaccinated for rubella and who have not had the disease in the past risk infecting themself and their unborn baby."
2097,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital rubella syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider:
if you have concerns about congenital rubella, if you are unsure of your vaccination status, or if you or your children need a rubella vaccine."
2098,What to expect if I have Congenital rubella syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome for a child with congenital rubella depends on the severity of problems present. Heart defects can often be corrected. Damage to the nervous system is permanent.
2099,What are the symptoms of Congenital syphilis?,"Symptoms in newborns may include:
Failure to gain weight or failure to thrive Fever Irritability No bridge to nose (saddle nose) Early rash - small blisters on the palms and soles Later rash - copper-colored, flat or bumpy rash on the face, palms, and soles Rash of the mouth, genitalia, and anus Watery discharge from the nose
Symptoms in older infants and young children may include:
Abnormal notched and peg-shaped teeth, called Hutchinson's teeth Bone pain Blindness Clouding of the cornea Decreased hearing or deafness Gray, mucus-like patches on the anus and outer vagina Joint swelling Refusal to move a painful arm or leg Saber shins (bone problem of the lower leg) Scarring of the skin around the mouth, genitalia, and anus"
2100,What causes Congenital syphilis?,"Congenital syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, which is passed from mother to child during fetal development or at birth. Nearly half of all children infected with syphilis while they are in the womb die shortly before or after birth.
Despite the fact that this disease can be cured with antibiotics if caught early, rising rates of syphilis among pregnant women in the United States have increased the number of infants born with congenital syphilis."
2101,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital syphilis ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has signs or symptoms of this condition.
If you think that you may have syphilis and are pregnant (or anticipate becoming pregnant), call your health care provider immediately."
2102,What to expect if I have Congenital syphilis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many infants who were infected early in the pregnancy are stillborn.
Treatment of the expectant mother lowers the risk of congenital syphilis in the infant.
Babies who become infected when passing through the birth canal have a better outlook."
2103,What are the symptoms of Conjunctivitis?,"Redness (hyperaemia), irritation (chemosis) and watering (epiphora) of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis. Additionally, symptoms vary based on the specific type of conjunctivitis:
Allergic conjunctivitis: Main article: Allergic conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis is typically itchy, sometimes distressingly so, and often involves some eye swelling. Chronic allergy often causes just itching or irritation. Allergic conjunctivitis often causes pale watery swelling of the conjunctiva and sometimes the whole eyelid. There is frequently a sticky mucus discharge, and there is variable redness. Viral conjunctivitis: Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, and/or a sore throat. Its symptoms include watery discharge and variable itch. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other. Viral conjunctivitis is commonly known as ""pink eye."" Bacterial conjunctivitis: Bacterial conjunctivitis due to the common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, grey or yellowish mucopurulent discharge (mucus, gowl, goop, gunk, eye crust, or other regional names, officially known as' gound') that may cause the lids to stick together (matting), especially after sleeping. Another symptom that could be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis is severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin. However, discharge is not essential to the diagnosis, contrary to popular belief. Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness. The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Like viral conjunctivitis, it usually affects only one eye but may spread easily to the other eye. However, it is dormant in the eye for three days before the patient shows signs of symptoms. Chemical conjunctivitis: Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is irritable or painful when the infected eye is pointed far down or far up. Discharge and itch are usually absent. It show primarily marked redness. This is the only group in which severe pain may occur."
2104,What causes Conjunctivitis?,"Conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by viruses, often adenovirus, but many other factors can lead to its occurrence. Other causes include:
Allergies (allergic conjunctivitis) Bacteria Certain diseases Chemical exposure Chlamydia Fungi Parasites (rarely) Use of contact lenses (especially extended-wear lenses)
Conjunctivitis is spread from person-to-person by:
Direct contact with the infected person’s eye drainage or drainage from the person’s cough, sneeze, or runny nose. Indirect contact with objects that may have the infected person’s drainage on them (e.g. eye makeup applicators, towels, shared eye medications). Contact with the infected person’s fingers or hands which may contain the virus or bacteria.
Newborns can be infected by bacteria in the birth canal. This condition is called ophthalmia neonatorum, and it must be treated immediately to preserve eyesight. Additionally, neonatal conjunctivitis is a red eye in a newborn caused by irritation, a blocked tear duct, or infection."
2105,Who is at highest risk for Conjunctivitis ?,"People who are exposed to someone infected with the viral or bacterial form of conjunctivitis are at risk for developing conjunctivitis. Children and adults can develop both bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, however bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in young children. Additionally, babies born to mothers infected with either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are at an increased risk for conjunctivitis. During delivery, these babies can contract ophthalmia neonatorum, a form of bacterial conjunctivitis when their eyes are exposed to the bacteria in the birth canal. It must be treated immediately to prevent blindness."
2106,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Conjunctivitis ?,"Urgent medical care is not usually necessary for conjunctivitis. However, newborns with ophthalmia neonatorum must be treated immediately to prevent blindness."
2107,What to expect if I have Conjunctivitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually good with treatment. Conjunctivitis resolves, in 65% of cases, within 2 – 5 days."
2108,What are the symptoms of Conversion disorder?,"Symptoms of a conversion disorder include the loss of one or more bodily functions, such as:
Blindness Inability to speak Numbness Paralysis
Diagnostic testing does not find any physical cause for the symptoms."
2109,What causes Conversion disorder?,"Conversion disorder symptoms may occur because of a psychological conflict.
Symptoms usually begin suddenly after a stressful experience. People are more at risk for a conversion disorder if they also have a medical illness, dissociative disorder, or a personality disorder.
It is important to understand that patients are not making up their symptoms (malingering). Some doctors falsely believe that conversion disorder is not a real condition, and may tell patients the problem is all in their head. However, these conditions are real. They cause distress and cannot be turned on and off at will.
The physical symptoms are thought to be an attempt to resolve the conflict the person feels inside. For example, a woman who believes it is not acceptable to have violent feelings may suddenly feel numbness in her arms after becoming so angry that she wanted to hit someone. Instead of allowing herself to have violent thoughts about hitting someone, she may experience the physical symptom of numbness in her arms."
2110,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Conversion disorder ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you or someone you know has symptoms of a conversion disorder.
2111,What to expect if I have Conversion disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Symptoms usually last for days to weeks and may suddenly go away. Usually the symptom itself is not life threatening, but complications can be debilitating."
2112,What are the symptoms of Corneal ulcer?,"Corneal ulcers are extremely painful due to nerve exposure, and can cause tearing and squinting.
Other symptoms include:
Eye burning, itching and discharge Eye pain Eye redness Impaired vision Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Watery eyes White patch on the cornea Signs of anterior uveitis, such as miosis (small pupil), aqueous flare (protein in the aqueous humour), and redness of the eye"
2113,What causes Corneal ulcer?,"Corneal ulcers are most commonly caused by an infection with bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Because bacteria can more easily penetrate a damaged cornea than a healthy one, a corneal ulcer is more likely to occur after some type of injury or trauma to the eye (e.g. tiny scratches from foreign particles that enter the eye).
Inappropriate contact lens wear (e.g. wearing the lenses overnight or not using proper hygiene when handling the lenses) may also lead to a corneal ulcer. Furthermore, a contact lens may damage the cornea as it scratches against the surface upon removal, thereby allowing easier bacterial penetration. Examples of viruses, fungi, and parasites that can cause corneal ulcers are:
Herpes simplex - This virus can lead to herpes simplex keratitis, which is a serious viral infection that may cause repeated attacks that are triggered by stress, exposure to sunlight, or any condition that impairs the immune system.
Fusarium - These fungi have been associated with fungal keratitis. The infection can occur after a corneal injury involving plant material, such as from a tree branch, or in immunosuppressed people.
Acanthamoeba - These parasites can lead to acanthamoeba keratitis mostly in contact lens users, especially those who attempt to make their own homemade cleaning solutions. It can also cause problems for people who wear their contact lenses while swimming.
Other causes of corneal ulcers include:
Abrasions (scratches) Foreign bodies in the eye Inadequate eyelid closure Severely dry eyes Severe eye allergies Various inflammatory disorders Chemical burns that can injure the cornea"
2114,Who is at highest risk for Corneal ulcer ?,"People with poor eye hygiene and contact lens abusers (e.g. those who wear contact lenses overnight) are at an increased risk of developing corneal ulcers.
Corneal ulcers are a common condition in humans, particularly those living in the tropics and in agrarian societies.
In developing countries, children afflicted by vitamin A deficiency are at a high risk for corneal ulcer and may become blind in both eyes, which may persist lifelong if not treated."
2115,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Corneal ulcer ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop impaired vision, severe light sensitivity, or eye pain."
2116,What to expect if I have Corneal ulcer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With proper, prompt treatment, the outlook is very good. However, if left untreated, a corneal ulcer or infection can permanently damage the cornea. Untreated corneal ulcers may also perforate the eye (cause holes), resulting in the spread of the infection inside, increasing the risk of permanent visual problems."
2117,What are the symptoms of Corticobasal degeneration?,"Initial symptoms, which typically begin at or around age 60, may first appear on one side of the body (unilateral), but eventually affect both sides as the disease progresses.
Symptoms include:
Poor coordination, Akinesia (an absence of movements), Rigidity (a resistance to imposed movement), Disequilibrium (impaired balance), Limb dystonia (abnormal muscle postures).
Other symptoms:
Cognitive and visual-spatial impairments, Apraxia (loss of the ability to make familiar, purposeful movements), Hesitant and halting speech, Myoclonus (muscular jerks), Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)."
2118,What to expect if I have Corticobasal degeneration  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Corticobasal degeneration usually progresses slowly over the course of 6 to 8 years.
An individual with corticobasal degeneration eventually becomes unable to walk."
2119,What are the symptoms of Costello syndrome?,"An excess of amniotic fluid Increased birth weight Subsequent weight loss and a failure to thrive Difficulty feeding Short stature
Oversized features, particularly the head and mouth Curly, thin hair Wide, short nose Deep, hoarse voice Loose, soft skin Increased pigmentation A large amount of warts on the face, may be absent during infancy and appear during early childhood Hair loss Splayed fingers Abnormal fingernails Abnormal feet positioning
Developmental delay, mental retardation Sociable personality
Tight Achilles tendons Abnormal curvature of the spine Assymetric rib cage
Increased heart tissue Heart defects present since birth Arrhythmia, abnormal electrical activity of the heart, causing irregular heart beats, faster or slower than normal
Hydrocephalus, an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain Seizures
In addition, there is a 15% chance that children and young adults with Costello syndrome suffer from malignant, solid tumors most commonly found in connective tissue, developing nerve cells, and the bladder."
2120,What are the causes of Costello syndrome?,"Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Almost all cases have resulted from new mutations, however, and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.
Geneticists believe that the symptoms associated with Costello syndrome are a result of a missense mutation in the HRAS gene. The HRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control cell growth and division. Mutations that cause Costello syndrome lead to the production of an HRAS protein that is permanently active. Instead of triggering cell growth in response to particular signals from outside the cell, the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly. This unchecked cell division may predispose to the development of benign and malignant tumors. It remains unclear how mutations in the HRAS gene cause the other features of Costello syndrome, but many of the signs and symptoms may result from cell overgrowth and abnormal cell division."
2121,Who is at highest risk for Costello syndrome ?,"Because Costello syndrome typically occurs as the result of a new mutation, family members are, for the most part, not at increased risk. In some cases, however, depending on the genetic make-up of the parents, siblings of people with Costello syndrome may be at risk for the condition.
In addition, although people with Costello syndrome typically do not reproduce, if they were to reproduce, the chance of passing the condition to their offspring is 50%."
2122,How to know you have Costello syndrome?,"Diagnosis of Costello syndrome is based on the presence of multiple, characteristic symptoms and is confirmed by molecular genetic testing. Sequence analysis of HRAS, the only gene currently known to be associated with Costello syndrome, detects missense mutations in 80%-90% of individuals with the clinical diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis should be reconsidered if no HRAS mutation is identified, and other genetic syndromes should be considered as alternative diagnoses."
2123,What are the symptoms of craniopharyngioma?,"Early craniopharyngioma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, functions about hormone making, growth, and vision may be affected. 
Symptoms by increasing the pressure on the brain
Headache Balance disorder Nausea and vomiting
Symptoms by disrupting the function of the pituitary gland
Increased thirst Increased urination Short stature Weight gain Menstrual irregularities
Symptoms by damaging the optic nerve
Double vision Vision loss
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2124,Who is at highest risk for Craniopharyngioma ?,The cause of craniopharyngioma is not clear at present. More studies need to done about it.
2125,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Craniopharyngioma ?,"Call your doctor if there are any signs of increased intracranial pressure such as headache, nausea, vomiting or imbalance, any visual changes, or increased thirst and urination, or poor growth in a child."
2126,What to expect if I have Craniopharyngioma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In general as a benign tumor, the prognosis of craniopharyngioma is good.  The outlook depends on:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The neurological deficits and hormonal imbalances caused by the tumor and the treatment The patient’s general health"
2127,What are the symptoms of Craniosynostosis?,"Absence of the normal feeling of a ""soft spot"" (fontanelle) on the newborn's skull Disappearance of the fontanelle early A raised hard ridge along the affected sutures Unusual head shape Slow or no increase in the head size over time as the baby grows"
2128,What causes Craniosynostosis?,"The cause of craniosynostosis is unknown. Which suture is involved determines the abnormal shape of the head.
A person's genes may play a role in craniosynostosis. The hereditary form often occurs with other defects that can cause seizures, diminished intellectual capacity, and blindness. Genetic disorders commonly associated with craniosynostosis include Crouzon syndrome, Apert syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, Chotzen syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome.
However, most cases of craniosynostosis occur in a family with no history of the condition, and children with craniosynostosis are otherwise healthy and have normal intelligence.
There are different types of craniosynostosis. Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly) is the most common type. It affects the main (sagittal) suture on the very top of the head. The early closing forces the head to grow long and narrow, instead of wide. Babies with this type of craniosynostosis tend to have a broad forehead. It is more common in boys than girls.
Frontal plagiocephaly is the next most common form. It is the closure of one side of the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head. It is more common in girls.
Metopic synostosis is a rare form of craniosynostosis that affects the suture close to the forehead. The child's head shape may be described as trigonocephaly, and varies in severity."
2129,Who is at highest risk for Craniosynostosis ?,"Craniosynostosis occurs more often in males than in females.
Children affected by certain genetic disorders may also be affected by craniosynostosis."
2130,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Craniosynostosis ?,Call your health care provider if you think your child's head has an unusual shape. A referral to a pediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon should follow.
2131,What to expect if I have Craniosynostosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well a person does depends on how many sutures are involved and whether other defects are present. Patients who have surgery usually do well, especially those whose condition is not associated with a genetic syndrome."
2132,What are the symptoms of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease?,"Rapidly developing delirium or dementia (over the course of a few weeks or months) Blurred vision (sometimes) Changes in gait (walking) Hallucinations Lack of coordination (for example, stumbling and falling) Muscle twitching Muscle stiffness Myoclonic jerks or seizures Nervous, jumpy feelings Personality changes Profound confusion, disorientation Sleepiness Speech impairment
CJD is rarely confused with other types of dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) because in CJD, symptoms progress much more rapidly. Both forms of CJD are distinguished by extremely rapid progression from onset of symptoms to disability and death."
2133,What causes Creutzfeldt Jakob disease?,"CJD is believed to result from a protein called a prion. A prion causes normal proteins to fold abnormally. This affects the other proteins' ability to function.
There are several types of CJD. The disorder is very rare, occurring in about 1 out of 1 million people. It usually first appears between ages 20 and 70, with average age at onset of symptoms in the late 50s.
CJD can be grouped into classic or new variant disease.
The classic types of CJD are:
Sporadic CJD makes up the majority of cases. It occurs for no known reason. Average age at onset is 65 Familial CJD results when a person inherited the abnormal prion (inherited CJD is rare) Classic CJD is not related to mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalitis).
New variant CJD (nvCJD):
New variant CJD is an infectious form that is related to mad cow disease. The infection responsible for the disease in cows is believed to be the same one responsible for vCJD in humans.
New variant CJD accounts for less than 1% of cases, and tends to affect younger people. It can result when someone is exposed to contaminated products. Other nvCJD cases have occurred when people were given corneal transplants from infected donors, and from contaminated electrodes that were used in brain surgery (before it was known how to properly disinfect instruments). There have not been any cases of nvCJD reported in the U.S.
CJD may be related to several other diseases also thought to be caused by prions, including kuru (seen in New Guinea women who ate the brains of deceased relatives as part of a funerary ritual), scrapie (found in sheep), chronic wasting disease (found in deer), and other rare human diseases, such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia."
2134,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ?,"CJD is not a medical emergency, but early diagnosis and treatment may make the symptoms easier to control, allow patients time to make advance directives, and give families additional time to come to terms with the condition."
2135,What to expect if I have Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually very poor. Within 6 months or less of the onset of symptoms, the person will become incapable of self-care.
The disorder is fatal in a short time, usually within 8 months, but a few people survive as long as 1 or 2 years after diagnosis.
The cause of death is usually infection, heart failure, or respiratory failure."
2136,What are the symptoms of Cri du chat?,Cry that is high-pitched and sounds like a cat Downward slant to the eyes Low birth weight and slow growth Low-set or abnormally shaped ears Mental retardation Partial webbing or fusing of fingers or toes Single line in the palm of the hand (simian crease) Skin tags just in front of the ear Slow or incomplete development of motor skills Small head (microcephaly) Small jaw (micrognathia) Wide-set eyes
2137,What are the causes of Cri du chat?,"Cri du chat syndrome is rare. It happens when genetic information on chromosome 5 is missing. One missing piece, called TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) is involved in control of cell growth, and may play a role in how some of the features of this syndrome develop.
Most cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A minority of cases result from one parent carrying a rearrangement of chromosome 5 called a translocation and passing this on to the baby.
Most cases of cri-du-chat syndrome are not inherited. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.
About 10 percent of people with cri-du-chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with cri-du-chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5, which results in the intellectual disability and health problems characteristic of this disorder."
2138,How to know you have cri du chat?,"In addition to symptoms listed above, the physical examination may show:
Inguinal hernia Diastasis recti (separated abdominal muscles) Low muscle tone Epicanthal folds, an extra fold of skin over the inner corner of the eye Incompletely or abnormally folded external ears
Genetic tests can show a missing part of chromosome 5. Skull x-ray may reveal an abnormal angle to the base of the skull."
2139,What to expect if I have Cri du chat  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"What can be expected varies, but mental retardation is usual. Half of children with Cri du chat syndrome learn sufficient verbal skills to communicate. The cat-like cry becomes less apparent over time."
2140,What are the symptoms of Crigler-Najjar syndrome?,"Confusion and changes in thinking Yellow skin (jaundice) and yellow in the whites of the eyes (icterus), which begin a few days after birth and get worse over time"
2141,What causes Crigler-Najjar syndrome?,"Crigler-Najjar syndrome is caused by an abnormal gene. The gene fails to make the enzyme that normally converts bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from the body. Without this enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin and eyes) and damage to the brain, muscles, and nerves.
Crigler-Najjar (type 1) is the early-onset form of the disease. Arias syndrome (type 2) is a later-onset condition.
The syndrome runs in families (inherited). A child must get the defective gene from both parents to develop the severe form of the condition. Parents who are carriers (with just one defective gene) have about half the enzyme activity of a normal adult."
2142,Who is at highest risk for Crigler-Najjar syndrome ?,The syndrome runs in families (inherited). A child must get the defective gene from both parents to develop the severe form of the condition. Parents who are carriers (with just one defective gene) have about half the enzyme activity of a normal adult.
2143,How to know you have Crigler-Najjar syndrome?,"Tests used to evaluate liver function include:
Conjugated (bound) bilirubin Liver biopsy, enzyme assay Total bilirubin level Unconjugated (unbound) bilirubin in blood"
2144,What are the symptoms of Crohn's disease?,"Symptoms depend on what part of the gastrointestinal tract is affected. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and can come and go with periods of flare-ups.
The main symptoms of Crohn's disease are:
Crampy abdominal (belly area) pain Fever Fatigue Persistent, watery diarrhea
Other symptoms may include:
Abdominal fullness and gas Clotting problems (deep vein thrombosis) Constipation Eye inflammation Fistulas (usually around the rectal area, may cause draining of pus, mucus, or stools) Gastrointestinal bleeding Joint pain Kidney stones Liver inflammation Loss of appetite Pain with passing stool (tenesmus) Rectal bleeding and bloody stools Skin rash Swollen gums Unintentional weight loss"
2145,What causes Crohn's disease?,"Several theories exist about what causes Crohn’s disease, but none have been proven. The human immune system is made from cells and different proteins that protect people from infection. The most popular theory is that the body’s immune system reacts abnormally in people with Crohn’s disease, mistaking bacteria, foods, and other substances for being foreign. The immune system’s response is to attack these “invaders.” During this process, white blood cells accumulate in the lining of the intestines, producing chronic inflammation, which leads to ulcerations and bowel injury.
Scientists do not know if the abnormality in the functioning of the immune system in people with Crohn’s disease is a cause, or a result, of the disease. Research shows that the inflammation seen in the GI tract of people with Crohn’s disease involves several factors: the genes the patient has inherited, the immune system itself, and the environment. Foreign substances, also referred to as antigens, are found in the environment. One possible cause for inflammation may be the body’s reaction to these antigens, or that the antigens themselves are the cause for the inflammation. Scientists have found that high levels of a protein produced by the immune system, called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), are present in people with Crohn’s disease."
2146,Who is at highest risk for Crohn%27s disease ?,"The disease may occur at any age, but it usually occurs in people between ages 15 - 35. Risk factors include:
Family history of Crohn's disease Jewish ancestry Smoking"
2147,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Crohn%27s disease ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of Crohn's disease You are already diagnosed with Crohn's disease and your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment You are already diagnosed with Crohn's disease and you develop new symptoms"
2148,What to expect if I have Crohn%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"There is no cure for Crohn's disease. The condition is marked by periods of improvement followed by flare-ups of symptoms.
It is very important to stay on medications long-term to try to keep the disease symptoms from returning. If you stop or change your medications for any reason, let your doctor know right away.
You have a higher risk for small bowel and colon cancer if you have Crohn's disease."
2149,What are the symptoms of croup?,"Croup features a cough that sounds like a seal barking. Most children have what appears to be a mild cold for several days before the barking cough becomes evident. As the cough gets more frequent, the child may have labored breathing or stridor (a harsh, crowing noise made during inspiration).
Croup is typically much worse at night. It often lasts 5 or 6 nights, but the first night or two are usually the most severe. Rarely, croup can last for weeks. Croup that lasts longer than a week or recurs frequently should be discussed with your doctor to determine the cause."
2150,What causes croup?,"Viral croup is the most common. Other possible causes include bacteria, allergies, and inhaled irritants. Acid reflux from the stomach can trigger croup. Viral croup is usually caused by human parainfluenza virus, but RSV, measles, adenovirus, and influenza can all cause croup as well."
2151,Who is at highest risk for Croup ?,"People with the following characteristics are at the highest risk for croup:
Infants and children between 6 months and 6 years old Males People living in densely populated regions People traveling to and from developing countries People without an influenza vaccine"
2152,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Croup ?,"Most croup can be safely managed at home with telephone support from your health care provider. Call 911 if:
The croup is possibly being caused by an insect sting or inhaled object The child has bluish lips or skin color The child is drooling The child is having trouble swallowing
Depending on the severity of the symptoms, call 911 or your health care provider for any of the following:
Stridor (noise when breathing in) Retractions (tugging-in between the ribs when breathing in) Struggling to breathe Agitation or extreme irritability Not responding to home treatment
Do NOT wait until morning to address the problem."
2153,What to expect if I have Croup  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Croup usually goes away in 3 to 7 days upon infection. Most symptoms will resolve by 1 to 2 days after manifestation. The outlook for croup is good with prompt treatment of symptoms. For milder cases, prognosis is good even if absence of treatment. For more severe cases, prompt treatment is necessary to prevent airway obstruction that can lead to life-threatening respiratory distress, (severe difficulty breathing), and respiratory failure."
2154,What are the Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome?,"Signs and symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome vary, but most people with the disorder have:
Upper body obesity A rounded face Increased fat around the neck Relatively slender arms and legs Children tend to be obese with slowed growth rates.
Other signs appear in the skin, which becomes fragile and thin, bruises easily, and heals poorly. Purple or pink stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms, and breasts. The bones are weakened, and routine activities such as bending, lifting, or rising from a chair may lead to backaches and rib or spinal column fractures. Women with Cushing’s syndrome usually have excess hair growth on their face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs. Their menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Men may have decreased fertility with diminished or absent desire for sex and, sometimes, erectile dysfunction. Other common signs and symptoms include:
Severe fatigue Weak muscles Hypertension High blood glucose Increased thirst and urination Irritability, anxiety, or depression A fatty hump between the shoulders"
2155,What causes Cushing's syndrome?,"Cushing’s syndrome occurs when the body’s tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. Many people develop Cushing’s syndrome because they take glucocorticoids—steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisol—such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue. Other people develop Cushing’s syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.
These benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing’s disease, affects women five times more often than men.
Some benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women.
In rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes Cushing’s syndrome. Adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. Most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood. Adrenocortical carcinomas—adrenal cancers—are the least common cause of Cushing’s syndrome. With adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.
Most cases of Cushing’s syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing’s syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. With primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. With multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; Cushing’s syndrome in MEN1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors."
2156,What are the symptoms of Cyclothymia?,"Episodes of hypomania and mild depression occur for at least 2 years (1 or more years in children and adolescents)
Mood swings are less severe than in bipolar disorder, major depression, or mania
Symptoms are persistent, with no more than 2 symptom-free months in a row"
2157,What causes Cyclothymia?,"The causes of cyclothymic disorder are unknown.
Major depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia often occur together in families. This suggests that these mood disorders share similar causes.
Cyclothymia usually begins early in life. It appears to be equally common in men and women."
2158,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cyclothymia ?,"Call a mental health professional if you or a loved one has persistent alternating periods of depression and excitement that negatively affect work, school, or social life.
Seek immediate help if you or a loved one is having thoughts of suicide."
2159,What to expect if I have Cyclothymia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Less than half of people with cyclothymic disorder will eventually develop bipolar disorder.
In other people, cyclothymia will continue as a chronic condition or disappear with time."
2160,Premature closing of deletion review?,"Per the Deletion review comment which you removed , to echo your comment, I'm not sure what part of ""five days"" you don't understand. What is the correct venue to complain when an AFD is closed out of process and the history is removed, then the deletion review is closed out of process. The rules for deletion review say it should stay up for 5 days, and this one was closed after 13 hours, with the vast majority of editors opposed to the speedy deletion and removal of all traces of the AFD. If you don't want people appending comments to the ""closed"" deletion review, then don't allow people to close it 13 hours after it is opened, when their viewpint is losing. Allow editors such as myself a chance to add our views. Did the owner of the Super Secret Number the Wikipedia Foundation and demand that all traces of it be removed? Did the Wikipedia legal counsel ask that oversight be applied? Is there any log to show when oversight actions are taken? Do you feel that when oversight removes something a comment to the effect should be added to the discussion page for the affected AFD? I am just checking to see if there is a process and that it is being followed. Thanks. Edison 03:45, 3 May 2007 (UTC)
Please read this thread to get an idea of what's going on. Long story short, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not an activism zone, publishing the key exposes us to danger, and there's no encyclopedic merit in doing so anyway. -- Cyde Weys 11:49, 3 May 2007 (UTC)
(I happened to notice this because your talk page is on my watchlist) I think it should also be noted that, although it appears to have come out after that discussion, there is advice from the EFF at this point stating that their interpretation of the DMCA points to the publication of the key being illegal and the safe harbor provision being inapplicable; in other words, we can't just wait for a notice. -- Philosophus T 12:10, 3 May 2007 (UTC) In the absence of the Office saying anything, I'd much rather listen to the Electronic Frontier Foundation for my advice on this issue than some self-styled legal ""buff"" on WP:ANI. The EFF employs real lawyers. The people saying it's okay on ANI are not, and are just speaking from an amateur (and potentially very harmful) understanding of law. -- Cyde Weys 20:20, 3 May 2007 (UTC)"
2161,What are the symptoms of Cystitis?,"The symptoms of a cystitis (bladder infection) include:
Cloudy or bloody urine, which may have a foul or strong odor Low fever (not everyone will have a fever) Pain or burning with urination Pressure or cramping in the lower abdomen (usually middle) or back Strong need to urinate often, even right after the bladder has been emptied
Often in an elderly person, mental changes or confusion are the only signs of a possible urinary tract infection."
2162,What causes Cystitis?,"Cystitis is caused by germs, usually bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. These bacteria can lead to infection, most commonly in the bladder. The infection can spread to the kidneys.
Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria when you urinate. However, sometimes the bacteria can stick to the wall of the urethra or bladder, or grow so fast that some bacteria stay in the bladder.
Women tend to get infections more often than men because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. For this reason, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual intercourse or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk for a urinary tract infection.
Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of bacteria found in the intestines."
2163,Who is at highest risk for Cystitis ?,"The following increase your chances of developing cystitis:
A tube called a urinary catheter inserted in your bladder Blockage of the bladder or urethra Diabetes Enlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urine Loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence) Older age (especially in people who live in nursing homes) Pregnancy Problems fully emptying your bladder (urinary retention) Procedures that involve the urinary tract Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, when you are recovering from a hip fracture)"

2170,What to expect if I have Cytomegalovirus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,It depends on the immune level of the patient.
2171,What are the causes of Cytomegalovirus infection?,"Cytomegalovirus infection is a viral infection caused by cytomegalovirus. Infection with CMV is very common. The infection is spread by:
Blood transfusions Organ transplants Respiratory droplets Saliva Sexual contact Urine Tears Most people come into contact with CMV in their lifetime. But usually, it's people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS, who become ill from CMV infection. Some otherwise healthy people with CMV infection develop a mononucleosis-like syndrome. CMV is a type of herpes virus. All herpes viruses remain in your body for the rest of your life. If your immune system becomes weakened in the future, this virus may have the chance to reactivate, causing symptoms."

2180,What are the symptoms of Dementia ?,"Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:
Language Memory Perception Emotional behavior or personality Cognitive skills (such as calculation, abstract thinking, or judgment)
Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness.
Mild cognitive impairment is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of dementia.
The early symptoms of dementia can include:
Language problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects Misplacing items  Getting lost on familiar routes Personality changes and loss of social skills Losing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat mood Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines
As the dementia becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of yourself. The symptoms may include:
Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you are Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night More difficulty reading or writing Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior Having delusions, depression, Agitation (patient information)|agitation Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving
People with severe dementia can no longer:
Understand language Recognize family members Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing
Other symptoms that may occur with dementia:
Incontinence Swallowing problems"
2181,What are the causes of Dementia ?,"Most types of dementia are nonreversible (degenerative). Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.
Lewy body disease is a leading cause of dementia in elderly adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain.
Dementia also can be due to many small strokes. This is called vascular dementia.
The following medical conditions also can lead to dementia:
Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Huntington's disease Pick's disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Infections that can affect the brain, such as HIV / AIDS and Lyme disease
Some causes of dementia may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including:
Brain tumors Changes in blood glucose, sodium, and calcium levels Low vitamin B12 levels Normal pressure hydrocephalus Use of certain medications, including cimetadine and some cholesterol-lowering medications Chronic alcohol abuse
Dementia usually occurs in older age. It is rare in people under age 60. The risk for dementia increases as a person gets older."

2184,What to expect if I have Dementia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with mild cognitive impairment do not always develop dementia. However, when dementia does occur, it usually gets worse and often decreases quality of life and lifespan."
2185,What causes Dementia with Lewy bodies?,"The symptoms of DLB are caused by the build-up of Lewy bodies which are accumulated bits of alpha-synuclein protein inside the nuclei of neurons in areas of the brain that control particular aspects of memory and motor control.
Researchers don’t know exactly why alpha-synuclein accumulates into Lewy bodies or how Lewy bodies cause the symptoms of DLB, but they do know that alpha-synuclein accumulation is also linked to Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and several other disorders, which are referred to as the synucleinopathies.
DLB usually occurs sporadically, in people with no known family history of the disease. However, rare familial cases have occasionally been reported."
2186,What are the symptoms of Dementia with Lewy bodies?,"Brief episodes of confusion and orientation to time or place Mild memory problems Well defined, vivid hallucinations Tremors or rigidity (especially if Haldol or other anti-psychotics given) Person has rigid, false beliefs that can’t be changed by convincing Unexplained loss of consciousness, frequent falls Symptoms can be temporary - vary from day to day or even throughout the day"
2187,What to expect if I have Dementia with Lewy bodies  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, DLB is a neuro-degenerative disorder that results in progressive intellectual and functional deterioration.
There are no known therapies to stop or slow the progression of DLB.
Average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that in Alzheimer’s disease, about 8 years, with progressively increasing disability."

Acting-out behaviors (missing curfews, unusual defiance) Criminal behavior (such as shoplifting) Irresponsible behavior Poor school performance, grades dropping Pulling away from family and friends, spending more time alone Use of alcohol or other illegal substances
If these symptoms last for at least 2 weeks and affect your mood or ability to function, get treatment.
Suicide is a risk for all teenagers with depression."
2193,What causes Adolescent depression?,"Depression can be a response to many situations and stresses. In teenagers, depressed mood is common because of:
The normal process of maturing and the stress that occurs with it The influence of sex hormones Independence conflicts with parents
It may also be a reaction to a disturbing event, such as:
The death of a friend or relative A breakup with a boyfriend or girlfriend Failure at school
Teens who are most likely to become depressed when they experience stressful events:
Have low self-esteem Are very critical of themselves Feel little control over negative events
Adolescent girls are twice as likely as boys to experience depression. A family history of depression also puts teenagers at greater risk.
The following events or situations can cause depression:

2196,What are the symptoms of Depression in Elderly?,"Many of the usual symptoms of depression may be present in the elderly.
Depression in the elderly may be hard to detect. Common symptoms such as fatigue, appetite loss, and trouble sleeping can be part of the aging process or a physical illness. As a result, early depression may be ignored, or confused with other conditions that are common in the elderly.
Clues to depression in the elderly may include:
Being more confused or forgetful. Eating less. The refrigerator may be empty or contain spoiled food. Not bathing or shaving as often. Visitors may notice smells of urine or stool. Clothes may be dirty and wrinkled. Not taking care of the home. Stopping medicines or not taking them correctly. Withdrawing from others. Not talking as much, and not answering the phone or returning phone calls."
2197,What causes Depression in Elderly?,"In the elderly, a number of life changes can increase the risk for depression, or make existing depression worse. Some of these changes are:
Adapting to a move from home to an apartment or retirement facility Chronic pain Feelings of isolation or loneliness as children move away and their spouse and close friends die Loss of independence (problems getting around, caring for themselves, or driving) Multiple illnesses Struggles with memory loss and problems thinking clearly
Elderly people often use alcohol to self-treat depression, but this may make symptoms worse.
Depression can be a sign of a physical illness. It can be a psychological reaction to the illness, or directly caused by the physical illness.
Physical illnesses that increase the risk for depression include: thyroid disorders, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Symptoms of depression may occur as part of dementia (Alzheimer's disease). Symptoms of depression are also a side effect of many drugs commonly prescribed for the elderly.
Many older people will not admit to feeling depressed, for fear that they will be seen as weak or crazy. Some older people will not report their depression because they believe that feeling sad is normal, or that nothing can be done about it."
2198,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Depression in elderly ?,"Call your health care provider if you feel persistently sad, worthless, or hopeless, or if you cry often. Also call if you are having trouble coping with stresses in your life and want to be referred for talk therapy.

2209,What are the symptoms of Diabetes insipidus?,Excessive thirst and intake of fluids Excessive urination Bedwetting Waking up in the middle of the night to urinate Diabetes mellitus can also present with similar symptoms.
2210,What causes Diabetes insipidus?,"There are 4 Types of Diabetes insipidus
The most common form of serious DI, central DI, results from damage to the pituitary gland, which disrupts the normal storage and release of ADH. Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times. The drug prevents water excretion, and water can build up now that the kidneys are making less urine and are less responsive to changes in body fluids.
Nephrogenic DI results when the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH. The kidneys ’ ability to respond to ADH can be impaired by drugs —like lithium, for example—and by chronic disorders including polycystic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, kidney failure, partial blockage of the ureters, and inherited genetic disorders. Sometimes the cause of nephrogenic DI is never discovered. Desmopressin will not work for this form of DI. Instead, a person with nephrogenic DI may be given hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or indomethacin. HCTZ is sometimes combined with another drug called amiloride. The combination of HCTZ and amiloride is sold under the brand name Moduretic. Again, with this combination of drugs, one should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times.
Dipsogenic DI is caused by a defect in or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in an abnormal increase in thirst and fluid intake that suppresses ADH secretion and increases urine output. Desmopressin or other drugs should not be used to treat dipsogenic DI because they may decrease urine output but not thirst and fluid intake. This fluid overload can lead to water intoxication, a condition that lowers the concentration of sodium in the blood and can seriously damage the brain. Scientists have not yet found an effective treatment for dipsogenic DI.
Gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and results when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in the mother. The placenta is the system of blood vessels and other tissue that develops with the fetus. The placenta allows exchange of nutrients and waste products between mother and fetus.Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used."
2211,Who is at highest risk for Diabetes insipidus ?,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus presenting at or shortly after birth can have a genetic cause. It usually affects males, though women can be a carrier and pass the gene on to their children."
2212,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diabetes insipidus ?,Tell your doctor if you are experiencing any of the symptoms associated with diabetes insipidus.
2213,What to expect if I have Diabetes insipidus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on the underlying disorder. If treated, diabetes insipidus does not cause severe problems or reduce life expectancy."
2214,What are the symptoms of Diabetic coma?,The same symptoms of all kinds of causes may be consciousness disorders.
2215,What causes Diabetic coma?,"The cause may severe diabetic hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma."
2216,Who is at highest risk for Diabetic coma ?,Anyone who has diabetes is at risk of a diabetic coma.
2217,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diabetic coma ?,It is an urgent condition that needs to go to the emergency department as soon as possible.
2218,What to expect if I have Diabetic coma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Left untreated, a diabetic coma can be fatal. Prognosis of diabetic coma depends on whether the patient is treated promptly and properly."
2219,What are the symptoms of Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma?,"Coma Confusion Convulsions Fever Increased thirst Increased urination (at the beginning of the syndrome) Lethargy Nausea Weakness Weight loss
Symptoms may get worse over a period of days or weeks.
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Dysfunctional movement Loss of feeling or function of muscles Speech impairment"
2220,What causes Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma?,"Diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome is a condition of:
Extremely high blood sugar (glucose) levels Extreme lack of water (dehydration) Decreased consciousness
The buildup of ketones in the body (ketoacidosis) may also occur. However, it is unusual and often mild.
This condition is usually seen in people with type 2 diabetes. It may occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes, or in people who have not been able to control their diabetes. The condition may be brought on by:
* Infection
Other illness such as heart attack or stroke Medications that lower glucose tolerance or increase fluid loss (in people who are losing or not getting enough fluid)
Normally, the kidneys try to make up for high glucose levels in the blood by allowing the extra glucose to leave the body in the urine. If you do not drink enough fluids, or you drink fluids that contain sugar, the kidneys can no longer get rid of the extra glucose. Glucose levels in the blood can become very high as a result. The blood then becomes much more concentrated than normal (hyperosmolarity).
Hyperosmolarity is a condition in which the blood has a high concentration of salt (sodium), glucose, and other substances that normally cause water to move into the bloodstream. This draws the water out of the body's other organs, including the brain. Hyperosmolarity creates a cycle of increasing blood glucose levels and dehydration."
2221,Who is at highest risk for Diabetic coma Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma?,"Risk factors include:
A stressful event such as infection, heart attack, stroke, or recent surgery Congestive heart failure Impaired thirst Limited access to water (especially in patients with dementia or who are bedbound) Older age Poor kidney function Poor management of diabetes -- not following the treatment plan as directed Stopping insulin or other medications that lower glucose levels"
2222,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diabetic coma Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma?,This condition is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you develop symptoms of diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.
2223,What to expect if I have Diabetic coma Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Patients who develop this syndrome are often already ill. The death rate with this condition is as high as 40%.
2224,What are the symptoms of Diabetic ketoacidosis?,"The following signs and symptoms are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis:
Shortness of breath Fruity breath Nausea and vomiting Excessive thirst Dry skin and mouth Flushed face Frequent urination Stomach pain Fatigue Loss of appetite Weakness or fatigue Confusion, stupor that may progress to coma"
2225,What causes Diabetic ketoacidosis?,"Sugar which is the main source of energy for cells, needs insulin to enter inside the cells. When the patient lacks enough insulin, sugar will not be able to enter inside the cell. This situation prompts the release of certain hormones that break down fat. The breakdown of fat produces ketone bodies. This process may be triggered in the presence of any infection, illness or drugs."
2226,Who is at highest risk for Diabetic ketoacidosis ?,"For patients with type 1 diabetes, stresses such as infection, trauma, heart attack, surgery or missing insulin doses can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients with type 2 diabetes who suffer a severe illness are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis."
2227,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diabetic ketoacidosis ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Vomiting or nausea Shortness of breath or fruity breath Decreased consciousness or mental stupor"
2228,What to expect if I have Diabetic ketoacidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of diabetic ketoacidosis depends on:
Whether the patient is diagnised or treated in time The age of the patient: Older people have worse outcomes than the young. Whether complications, such as heart attack, renal failure and hypokalemia occur."
2229,What are the symptoms of Diphyllobothriasis?,"Most people who are infected have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they may include:
Abdominal discomfort or pain Diarrhea Weakness Weight loss"
2230,What causes Diphyllobothriasis?,"The fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum), is the largest parasite that infects humans. Humans become infected when they eat raw or undercooked freshwater fish that contain fish tapeworm cysts. The infection is seen in many areas where humans eat uncooked or undercooked fish from rivers or lakes such as:
Eastern Europe North and South America Scandinavia Some Asian countries
After a person has eaten infected fish, the larva begins to grow in the intestine. Larvae are fully grown in 3 - 6 weeks. The adult worm, which is segmented, may reach a length of 30 feet. Eggs are formed in each segment of the worm and are passed in the stool. Sometimes, parts of the worm may also be passed in the stool. Fish tapeworm infection may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia."
2231,Who is at highest risk for Diphyllobothriasis ?,"Diphyllobothrium infection generally occurs in the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, newly independent states of the Former Soviet Union, North America, Asia), but has been reported in Uganda and Chile. Fish infected with Diphyllobothrium larvae may be transported to and consumed in any area of the world."
2232,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diphyllobothriasis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have noticed a worm or segments of a worm in your stool Any family members have symptoms of pernicious anemia"
2233,What to expect if I have Diphyllobothriasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Fish tapeworms can be removed with a single treatment dose. There are no lasting effects.
2234,What are the symptoms of dislocated patella?,"Knee appears to be deformed Knee is bent and cannot straighten Knee pain and / or knee swelling Sloppy or ""hypermobile"" knees"
2235,What causes dislocated patella?,"A dislocated patella is often caused by a sudden change in direction which puts the kneecap under stress. Dislocation of the knee may also occur as a direct result of injury. When the patella is dislocated, it slips out of the joint and around the knee region."
2236,Who is at highest risk for Dislocated patella ?,"Mainly, the people at highest risk of dislocation of the patella are people with ""sloppy"" or ""hypermobile"" knees, which means that you can easily move the kneecap around the joint, and that it may slide around every once in a while."
2237,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dislocated patella ?,"You should seek urgent medical care if you have dislocated your knee multiple times, or if you dislocate your knee and cannot fix it."
2238,What to expect if I have Dislocated patella  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If you have dislocated your knee, then there's always the possibility that it could pop out or dislocate again, so you want to be cautious as to physical activity to make sure that you do not re-injure the knee."
2239,What are the symptoms of Disorder of written expression?,Errors in grammar and punctuation Poor handwriting Poor spelling
2240,What causes Disorder of written expression?,"Although no studies have been conducted to determine how common this disorder is, it is thought to be about as common as learning and reading disorders.

2243,What are the symptoms of Disorganized schizophrenia?,"Active behavior, but in an aimless and not constructive way Bizarre and inappropriate emotional responses Difficulty feeling pleasure False, fixed beliefs (delusions) Lack of motivation Seeing or hearing things that aren't there (hallucinations) Strange or silly behavior Speech that makes no sense
Some of these symptoms are also seen in other types of schizophrenia. The main difference is that in disorganized schizophrenia, there is a lot of strange, aimless behavior and often speech that does not make sense."
2244,What causes Disorganized schizophrenia?,The cause is unknown. This type of schizophrenia usually begins before age 25.
2245,What are the symptoms of Diverticulitis?,"Abdominal pain, usually in the left lower abdomen but can be anywhere Chills Fever Nausea Vomiting Weight loss"
2246,What are the causes of Diverticulitis?,"Although not proven, the dominant theory is that a low-fiber diet causes diverticular disease. The disease was first noticed in the United States in the early 1900s, around the time processed foods were introduced into the American diet. Consumption of processed foods greatly reduced Americans’ fiber intake.
Diverticular disease is common in developed or industrialized countries—particularly the United States, England, and Australia —where low-fiber diets are consumed. The disease is rare in Asia and Africa, where most people eat high-fiber diets.
Fiber is the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains that the body cannot digest. Some fiber, called soluble fiber, dissolves easily in water. It takes on a soft, jelly-like texture in the intestines. Insoluble fiber passes almost unchanged through the intestines. Both kinds of fiber help prevent constipation by making stools soft and easy to pass.
Constipation —or hard stool—may cause people to strain when passing stool during a bowel movement. Straining may cause increased pressure in the colon, which may cause the colon lining to bulge out through weak spots in the colon wall. These bulges are diverticula.
Lack of exercise also may be associated with a greater risk of forming diverticula, although the reasons for this are not well understood.
Doctors are not certain what causes diverticula to become inflamed. The inflammation may begin when bacteria or stool are caught in the diverticula. An attack of diverticulitis can develop suddenly and without warning."
2247,Who is at risk for Diverticulitis?,Risk factors for diverticulosis may include older age or a low-fiber diet.
2248,How to know you have Diverticulitis?,"To diagnose diverticular disease, the doctor asks about medical history, does a physical exam, and may perform one or more diagnostic tests. Because most people do not have symptoms, diverticulosis is often found through tests ordered for another ailment. For example, diverticulosis is often found during a colonoscopy done to screen for cancer or polyps or to evaluate complaints of pain or rectal bleeding.
When taking a medical history, the doctor may ask about bowel habits, pain, other symptoms, diet, and medications. The physical exam usually involves a digital rectal exam. To perform this test, the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to detect tenderness, blockage, or blood. The doctor may check stool for signs of bleeding and test blood for signs of infection. If diverticulitis is suspected, the doctor may order one of the following radiologic tests:
Abdominal ultrasound. Sound waves are sent toward the colon through a handheld device that a technician glides over the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the colon and other organs, and their echoes make electrical impulses that create a picture—called a sonogram —on a video monitor. If the diverticula are inflamed, the sound waves will also bounce off of them and show the location. Computerized tomography (CT) scan. The CT scan is a noninvasive x ray that produces cross-section images of the body. The doctor may inject dye into a vein and the person may be given a similar mixture to swallow. The person lies on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The dye helps to show complications of diverticulitis such as perforations and abscesses."
2249,What are the symptoms of Donovanosis?,"Symptoms can occur 1 to 12 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria that cause the disease. About half of infected men and women have sores in the anal area. Small, beefy-red bumps appear on the genitals or around the anus. The skin gradually wears away, and the bumps turn into raised, beefy-red, velvety nodules called granulation tissue. They are usually painless, but they bleed easily if injured. The disease slowly spreads and destroys genital tissue. Tissue damage may spread to the area where the legs meet the torso. This area is called the inguinal folds. The genitals and the skin around them lose skin color. In its early stages, it may be hard to tell the difference between donovanosis and chancroid. In the later stages, donovanosis may look like advanced genital cancers, lymphogranuloma venereum, and anogenital cutaneous amebiasis."
2250,What causes Donovanosis?,"Donovanosis (granuloma inguinale) is caused by the bacteria Klebsiella granulomatis. The disease is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas such as Southeast India, Guyana, and New Guinea. However, it can sometimes occur in the United States, typically in the Southeast. There are about 100 cases reported per year in the United States. The disease spreads mostly through vaginal or anal intercourse. Very rarely, it spreads during oral sex.
Men are affected more than twice as often as women. Most infections occur in people ages 20-40. The disease is rarely seen in children or the elderly."
2251,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Donovanosis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if: You have had sexual contact with a person who is known to have donovanosis You develop symptoms of donovanosis
2252,What to expect if I have Donovanosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Treating this disease early decreases the chances of tissue damage or scarring. Untreated disease leads to damage of the genital tissue.
2253,What are the symptoms of Drug induced hemolytic anemia?,Dark urine Fatigue Pale skin color Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Yellow skin color (jaundice)
2254,What causes Drug induced hemolytic anemia?,"In some cases, a drug can cause the immune system to mistakenly think your own red blood cells are dangerous, foreign substances. Antibodies then develop against the red blood cells. The antibodies attach to red blood cells and cause them to break down too early.
Drugs that can cause this type of hemolytic anemia include:
Cephalosporins (a class of antibiotics) is the most common cause Dapsone Levodopa Levofloxacin Methyldopa Nitrofurantoin Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Penicillin and its derivatives Phenazopyridine (pyridium) Quinidine
There are other, rarer causes of drug-induced hemolytic anemia. This includes hemolytic anemia associated with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In this case, the breakdown of red blood cells is due to a certain type of stress in the cell, rather than the body's immune system.
Drug-induced hemolytic anemia is rare in children."
2255,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Drug induced hemolytic anemia ?,See your health care provider if you have symptoms of this condition.
2256,What to expect if I have Drug induced hemolytic anemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most patients have a good outcome if they stop taking the drug that is causing the problem.
2257,What are the symptoms of Drug-induced lupus erythematosus?,"Symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus always occur after taking the drug for at least 3 to 6 months. Common symptoms are similar to systemic lupus erythemathosus.
Fatigue and weakness Low fever Muscle pain Joint pain Loss of appetite Facial butterfly rash Sensitivity to sunlight Chest pain Swollen lymph nodes"
2258,What causes Drug-induced lupus erythematosus?,"Drug-induced lupus erythematosus is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to a medication. Several following medications are known to cause drug-induced lupus:
Procainamide Hydralazine Quinidine Chlorpromazine Isoniazid Methyldopa Penicillamine Sulfasalazine"
2259,Who is at highest risk for Drug-induced lupus erythematosus ?,"The major risk factor for developing drug-induced lupus is chronic, long-term use of a drug known to cause Drug induced lupus."
2260,What to expect if I have Drug-induced lupus erythematosus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis of drug-induced lupus erythematosus is better than systemic lupus erythemathosus. Symptoms usually disappear within several days to weeks after stopping the medication that caused the condition.
2261,What are the symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,"Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. They may include:
Fatigue Mental retardation (possible, but does not worsen over time) Muscle weakness
Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the body Difficulty with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping) Frequent falls Rapidly worsening weakness
Progressive difficulty walking: Ability to walk may be lost by age 12
By age 10, the person may need braces for walking. By age 12, most patients are confined to a wheelchair."
2262,What causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rapidly-worsening form of muscular dystrophy. Other muscular dystrophies (including Becker's muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition.
Because of the way the disease is inherited, males are more likely to develop symptoms than are women. The sons of females who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
2263,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Duchenne muscular dystrophy ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Your child has symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy Symptoms worsen, or new symptoms develop, particularly fever with cough or breathing difficulties"
2264,What to expect if I have Duchenne muscular dystrophy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy leads to quickly worsening disability.
Death usually occurs by age 25, typically from lung disorders."
2265,What are the symptoms of duodenitis?,"Signs and symptoms vary widely. Some patients do not have any symptoms. Some may experience the following symptoms:
Stomach pain or chest pain or back pain Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Loss of weight Bleeding from the intestine Intestinal obstruction: rarely
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2266,What causes duodenitis?,"There are many things that can cause duodenitis.
High acid secretion, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Some drugs, such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) Stress Irritative diet Alcohol abuse H. pylori or giardia infection"

Severe stomach pain Bleeding from the intestine"
2268,What to expect if I have Duodenitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"General speaking, the prognosis of duodenitis is good. The rehabilitation time of the lining of the duodenum depends on the treatment effectiveness for the underlying cause of the duodenitis."
2269,What are the symptoms of Dyscalculia?,"Early difficulties with arithmetic are noticed, as well as low scores in math classes and tests
Some of the problems seen include:
Trouble with reading, writing, and copying numbers Problems counting and adding numbers, often making simple mistakes Difficulty telling the difference between addition and subtraction Problems understanding math symbols and word problems Unable to line up numbers properly to add, subtract, or multiply Unable to arrange numbers from smallest to largest, or the opposite Unable to understand graphs"
2270,What causes Dyscalculia?,"Children who have mathematics disorder may have trouble performing simple mathematical equations, such as counting and adding.
Mathematical disorder may appear with:

2271,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dyscalculia ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have any concerns about your child's development.
2272,What to expect if I have Dyscalculia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Early intervention improves the chances of a better outcome.
2273,What are the symptoms of Dysfunctional uterine bleeding?,"A woman with dysfunctional uterine bleeding may notice the following changes in her menstrual cycle:
Bleeding or spotting from the vagina occurs between periods Menstrual periods may be less than 28 days (more common) or more than 35 days apart Time between menstrual periods changes with each cycle Bleeding is heavier (passing large clots, needing to change protection during the night, soaking through a sanitary pad or tampon every hour for 2 - 3 hours in a row) Bleeding lasts for more days than normal or for more than 7 days
Other symptoms caused by changes in hormone levels are:
Excessive growth of body hair in a male pattern (hirsutism) Hot flashes Mood swings Tenderness and dryness of the vagina
A woman may feel tiredness or fatigue if she is losing too much blood over time and becomes anemic."
2274,What causes Dysfunctional uterine bleeding?,"The menstrual cycle, or period, is not the same for every woman. On average, menstrual flow occurs every 28 days (most women have cycles between 24 and 34 days apart), and lasts 4 - 7 days.
The menstrual cycle of young girls who are just starting to have their periods can range from 21 to 45 days or more apart. Women in their 40s will often notice their menstrual cycles occurring less often.
During a normal menstrual cycle, levels of different female hormones made by your body go up and down. Estrogen and progesterone are two very important hormones.
Ovulation is the part of the normal menstrual cycle when an egg is released from the ovaries. The most common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is when your ovaries do not release an egg. When this occurs, the hormone levels in your body are not the same, causing your period to be later or earlier and heavier than normal.
Other changes in hormones may also cause changes in your period."
2275,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dysfunctional uterine bleeding ?,Call your health care provider if you have unusual vaginal bleeding.
2276,What to expect if I have Dysfunctional uterine bleeding  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hormone therapy usually relieves symptoms.
As long as there is no problem with anemia (low blood count), no treatment is needed."
2277,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dysmenorrhea ?,"Call your doctor right away if:
Vaginal discharge is increased in amount or is foul-smelling. You have a fever. Your pain is significant, your period is more than one week late, and you have been sexually active.
Also call your doctor if:
Self-care measures don't relieve your pain after 3 months. You have an IUD that was placed more than 3 months ago. You pass blood clots or have other symptoms with the pain. Your pain is severe or sudden. Your pain occurs at times other than menstruation, begins more than 5 days before your period, or continues after your period is over."
2278,What are the symptoms of Dysthymia?,"The main symptom of dysthymia is a low, dark, or sad mood on most days for at least 2 years. In children and adolescents, the mood can be irritable instead of depressed and may last for at least 1 year.
In addition, two or more of the following symptoms will be present almost all of the time that the person has dysthymia:
Feelings of hopelessness Too little or too much sleep Low energy or fatigue Low self-esteem Poor appetite or overeating Poor concentration
People with dysthymia will often take a negative or discouraging view of themselves, their future, other people, and life events. Problems often seem more difficult to solve."
2279,What causes Dysthymia?,"The exact cause of dysthymia is unknown. It tends to run in families. Dysthymia occurs more often in women than in men and affects up to 5% of the general population.
Many people with dysthymia have a long-term medical problem or another mental health disorder, such as anxiety, alcohol abuse, or drug addiction.
About half of people with dysthymia will also have an episode of major depression at some point in their lives.
Dysthymia in the elderly is often caused by:
Difficulty caring for themselves Isolation Mental decline Medical illnesses"
2280,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dysthymia ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You regularly feel depressed or low Your symptoms are getting worse
Call for help immediately if you or someone you know develops these symptoms, which are signs of a suicide risk:
Giving away belongings, or talking about going away and the need to get ""affairs in order"" Performing self-destructive behaviors, such as injuring themselves Suddenly changing behaviors, especially being calm after a period of anxiety Talking about death or suicide, or even stating the desire to harm themselves Withdrawing from friends or being unwilling to go out anywhere"
2281,What to expect if I have Dysthymia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Dysthymia is a chronic condition that lasts many years. Though some people completely recover, others continue to have some symptoms, even with treatment.
Although it is not as severe as major depression, dysthymia symptoms can affect a person's ability to function in their family, and at work.
Dysthymia also increases the risk for suicide."
2282,What are the symptoms of Dystonia?,"Dystonia can affect many different parts of the body.
Symptoms may include:
deterioration in handwriting after writing several lines foot cramps tendency of one foot to pull up or drag; this may occur ""out of the blue"" or may occur after running or walking some distance. the neck may turn or pull involuntarily, especially when the patient is tired or stressed. both eyes may sometimes blink rapidly and uncontrollably, rendering a person functionally blind tremor voice or speech difficulties, possibly with a hoarse voice Tiredness and soreness due to the excessive muscle contractions
The initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or fatigue. Over a period of time, the symptoms may become more noticeable and widespread and be unrelenting. Sometimes, however, there is little or no progression.
Dystonias are sometimes classified according to the parts of the body they affect:
Generalized dystonia affects most or all of the body. Focal dystonia is localized to a specific part of the body. Multifocal dystonia involves two or more unrelated body parts. Segmental dystonia affects two or more adjacent parts of the body. Hemidystonia involves the arm and leg on the same side of the body."
2283,What causes Dystonia?,"It is not exactly clear what causes dystonias. There are two types of dystonia: acquired dystonia and idiopathic dystonia.
Acquired dystonia, also called secondary dystonia, results from environmental or disease-related damage to the basal ganglia. Birth injury (particularly due to lack of oxygen), certain infections, reactions to certain drugs, heavy-metal or carbon monoxide poisoning, trauma, or stroke can cause dystonic symptoms. Dystonias can also be symptoms of other diseases, some of which may be hereditary.
About half the cases of dystonia have no connection to disease or injury and are called primary or idiopathic dystonia. Of the primary dystonias, many cases appear to be inherited in a dominant manner; i.e., only one carrier parent need contribute the dystonia gene for the disease to occur, each child having a 50% chance of being a carrier. In dystonia, however, a carrier may or may not develop a dystonia and the symptoms may vary widely even among members of the same family. The product of one defective gene appears to be sufficient to cause the chemical imbalances that may lead to dystonia; but the possibility exists that another gene or genes and environmental factors may play a role. Researchers have identified more than 15 different genetic mutations that may contribute to dystonia.
Whether you have acquired or idiopathic dystonia, researchers think that it is caused by a problem in the part of the brain that handles messages about muscle contractions. Scientists suspect a defect in the body's ability to process a group of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help cells in the brain communicate with each other.
The ultimate goals of research are to find the cause(s) of the dystonias so that they can be prevented, and to find ways to cure and/or more effectively treat people now affected. Scientists at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) laboratories have conducted detailed investigations of the pattern of muscle activity in persons with focal dystonias. One of the most important characteristics is the failure of reciprocal inhibition, a normal process in which muscles with opposite actions work without opposing each other. In dystonia, the tightening of muscles is associated with an abnormal pattern of muscles fighting each other. The search for the gene or genes responsible for some forms of dominantly inherited dystonias continues."
2284,Who is at highest risk for Dystonia ?,Different dystonias are caused by different factors. Those who have a family history of idiopathic dystonia have a higher risk of inheriting it. Some cases of primary dystonia may have different types of hereditary patterns. Knowing the pattern of inheritance can help families understand the risk of passing dystonia along to future generations.
2285,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dystonia ?,"Call your doctor is you are having any type of involuntary muscle contractions, even if they are mild or occur irregularly."
2286,What to expect if I have Dystonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or fatigue. Dystonias often progress through various stages. Initially, dystonic movements are intermittent and appear only during voluntary movements or stress. Later, individuals may show dystonic postures and movements while walking and ultimately even while they are relaxed.
Response to treatment is different for every person, and can even change for a person over time."
2287,What causes Ebola?,"Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebola fever) is caused by a virus belonging to the family called Filoviridae. Scientists have identified four types of the Ebola virus. Three have been reported to cause disease in humans: Ebola-Zaire virus, Ebola-Sudan virus, and Ebola-Ivory Coast virus. The human disease has so far been limited to parts of Africa. A very small number of people in the United States, who were infected with the fourth type of the virus, known as Ebola Reston, did not develop any signs of disease. The disease can be passed to humans from infected animals and animal materials. Ebola can also be spread between humans, by close contact with infected bodily fluids, or through infected needles at the hospital. A person infected with Ebola is contagious from the moment he/she begins to show symptoms."
2288,How does Ebola cause infection?,"Ebola virus is able to infect someone by the following mechanism:
Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa, infection has occurred through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. It is important to reduce contact with high-risk animals, including not picking up dead animals, found lying in the forest or handling their raw meat.
Once a person comes into contact with an animal that has Ebola, it can spread within the community from human to human.
Infection occurs from direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, or other bodily fluids or secretions (stool, urine, saliva, semen) of infected people. Infection can also occur if broken skin or mucous membranes of a healthy person come into contact with environments that have become contaminated with an Ebola patient’s infectious fluids, such as soiled clothing, bed linen, or used needles.
People are infectious, as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. For this reason, infected patients receive close monitoring from medical professionals and receive laboratory tests to ensure the virus is no longer circulating in their systems before they return home. When the medical professionals determine it is okay for the patient to return home, they are no longer infectious and cannot infect anyone else in their communities."
2289,What are the symptoms of Ebola?,"During the incubation period, which can last from 2 to 21 days, symptoms may include:
Sudden onset of fever Chills Malaise Severe weakness Muscle pain Low back pain Headache Arthritis Sore throat Vomiting Diarrhea Nausea Skin rash
Late symptoms include:
Impaired kidney function Impaired liver function Internal and external bleeding, commonly:
Bleeding from eyes, ears, and nose Bleeding from the mouth and rectum (gastrointestinal bleeding)
Depression Eye inflammation (conjunctivitis) Genital swelling (labia and scrotum) Increased feeling of pain in skin Rash over the entire body, often containing blood (hemorrhagic) Roof of mouth looks red Seizures, coma, delirium
As many as 90% of patients die from the disease. Patients usually die from shock rather than from blood loss."
2290,Who is at highest risk for Ebola ?,"Persons at an increased risk for Ebola include:
Travelers to an area of the world where Ebola occurs frequently (such as Central Africa) Hospital staff/caregivers for patients with Ebola Family members or close contacts of infected people People who have close contact with the body of a deceased person, infected with ebola virus, during burial ceremonies Hunters in rain forests who contact with abandoned dead animals Research is being conducted to evaluate the risk of immunocompromised people or those with underlying diseases, to contacting the Ebola virus"
2291,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ebola ?,"A person should seek urgent medical care when:
Has traveled to Africa Has been in an area known to have Ebola virus disease Has been in contact with another person who is known or suspected to have Ebola and is beginning to show symptoms Has been exposed to Ebola fever Develops symptoms of the disorder
Urgent medical care is fundamental to improve the survival rateand to control the spread of the disease. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve the chances of survival."
2292,What to expect if I have Ebola  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,As many as 90% of patients die from the disease. Patients usually die from shock rather than blood loss.
2293,What are the symptoms of Echinococcosis?,"A liver cyst may produce no symptoms for 10 - 20 years until it is large enough to be felt by physical examination. Symptoms include:

2301,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Eclampsia ?,"Call your health care provider or go to the emergency room if you have any symptoms of eclampsia or preeclampsia.
Emergency symptoms include seizures or decreased consciousness."
2302,What to expect if I have Eclampsia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Women in the United States rarely die from eclampsia.
2303,What are the symptoms of Ectopic pregnancy?,"Symptoms include:
Abnormal vaginal bleeding Amenorrhea Breast tenderness Low back pain Mild cramping on one side of the pelvis Nausea Pain in the lower abdomen or pelvic area
If the area of the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include:
Feeling faint or actually fainting Intense pressure in the rectum Pain that is felt in the shoulder area Severe, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen
Internal bleeding due to a rupture may lead to low blood pressure and fainting in around 1 out of 10 women."
2304,What causes Ectopic pregnancy?,"An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a pregnancy starts outside the womb (uterus). The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is within one of the tubes through which the egg passes from the ovary to the uterus (fallopian tube). However, in rare cases, ectopic pregnancies can occur in the ovary, stomach area, or cervix.
An ectopic pregnancy is often caused by a condition that blocks or slows the movement of a fertilized egg through the fallopian tube to the uterus. This may be caused by a physical blockage in the tube by hormonal factors and by other factors, such as smoking.
Most cases of scarring are caused by:
Past ectopic pregnancy Past infection in the fallopian tubes Surgery of the fallopian tubes
Up to 50% of women who have ectopic pregnancies have had swelling (inflammation) of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis) or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
Some ectopic pregnancies can be due to:
Birth defects of the fallopian tubes Complications of a ruptured appendix Endometriosis Scarring caused by previous pelvic surgery
In a few cases, the cause is unknown.
Sometimes, a woman will become pregnant after having her tubes tied (tubal sterilization). Ectopic pregnancies are more likely to occur 2 or more years after the procedure, rather than right after it. In the first year after sterilization, only about 6% of pregnancies will be ectopic, but most pregnancies that occur 2 - 3 years after tubal sterilization will be ectopic.
Ectopic pregnancy is also more likely in women who have:
Had surgery to reverse tubal sterilization in order to become pregnant Had an intrauterine device (IUD) and became pregnant (very unlikely when IUDs are in place)
Ectopic pregnancies occur in 1 in every 40 to 1 in every 100 pregnancies."
2305,Who is at highest risk for Ectopic pregnancy ?,"The following may also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy:
Age over 35 Having had many sexual partners In vitro fertilization"
2306,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ectopic pregnancy ?,"If you have symptoms of ectopic pregnancy (especially lower abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding), call your health care provider.
You can have an ectopic pregnancy if you are able to get pregnant (fertile) and are sexually active, even if you use birth control."
2307,What to expect if I have Ectopic pregnancy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"One-third of women who have had one ectopic pregnancy are later able to have a baby. A repeated ectopic pregnancy may occur in one-third of women. Some women do not become pregnant again.
The likelihood of a successful pregnancy depends on:
The woman's age Whether she has already had children Why the first ectopic pregnancy occurred
The rate of death due to an ectopic pregnancy in the United States has dropped in the last 30 years to less than 0.1%."
2308,What are the symptoms of Edwards syndrome?,Clenched hands Crossed legs (preferred position) Feet with a rounded bottom (rocker-bottom feet) Low birth weight Low-set ears Mental deficiency Small jaw (micrognathia) Underdeveloped fingernails Undescended testicle Unusual shaped chest (pectus carinatum)
2309,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Edwards syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider and genetic counselor if you have had a child with Trisomy 18 and you plan to have another child. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risks of inheriting it, and how to care for the patient."
2310,What to expect if I have Edwards syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Fifty percent of infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life. Some children have survived to the teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems."
2311,What are the symptoms of Emphysema?,"Symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion, and an expanded chest. Signs of emphysema include pursed-lipped breathing and central cyanosis. The chest has hyperresonant percussion notes, particularly just above the liver, and a difficult to palpate apex beat, both due to hyperinflation. There may be decreased breath sounds and audible expiratory wheeze. In advanced disease, there are signs of fluid overload such as pitting peripheral edema. The face has a ruddy complexion if there is a secondary polycythemia. Sufferers who retain carbon dioxide have asterixis (metabolic flap) at the wrist."
2312,What causes Emphysema?,The most common cause is cigarette smoking.
2313,Who is at risk for Emphysema?,"Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) are more likely to suffer from emphysema. A1AD allows inflammatory enzymes (such as elastase) to destroy the alveolar tissue. Most A1AD patients do not develop clinically significant emphysema, but smoking and severely decreased A1AT levels (10-15%) can cause emphysema at a young age. The type of emphysema caused by A1AD is known as panacinar emphysema (involving the entire acinus) as opposed to centrilobular emphysema, which is caused by smoking. Panacinar emphysema typically affects the lower lungs, while centrilobular emphysema affects the upper lungs. A1AD causes about 2% of all emphysema. Smokers with A1AD are at the greatest risk for emphysema. Mild emphysema can often develop into a severe case over a short period of time (1–2 weeks)."
2314,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Emphysema ?,Patients who think they may have contracted the disease are recommended to seek medical attention as soon as possible.
2315,What to expect if I have Emphysema  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Emphysema is an irreversible degenerative condition, but its progression can be slowed if the patient adheres to proper treatment methods."
2316,What are the symptoms of Empty sella syndrome?,"Often, there are no symptoms or loss of pituitary function.
Patients with empty sella syndrome may have symptoms caused by a partial or complete loss of pituitary gland function. For more information, see hypopituitarism.
Symptoms include:
Erectile dysfunction (impotence) Headaches Irregular or absent menstruation Low sexual desire (low libido) Nipple discharge"
2317,What causes Empty sella syndrome?,"The pituitary gland is a small gland located at the base of the brain. It sits in a saddle-like compartment in the skull called the "" sella turcica,"" which in Latin means ""Turkish saddle.""
When the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, it cannot be seen on MRI scans, giving the appearance of an ""empty sella."" This is referred to as empty sella syndrome.
The pituitary makes several hormones that control the other glands in the body, including the:
Adrenal glands Ovaries Testicles Thyroid
Primary empty sella syndrome occurs when a hole in the membrane covering the pituitary gland allows fluid in, which presses on the pituitary.
Secondary empty sella syndrome occurs when the sella is empty because the pituitary gland has been damaged by:
A tumor Radiation therapy Surgery"
2318,Who is at highest risk for Empty sella syndrome ?,Empty sella syndrome may be seen in a condition called pseudotumor cerebri. This is a condition seen most commonly in obese women.
2319,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Empty sella syndrome ?,"Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms of abnormal pituitary function, such as a disrupted menstrual cycle or impotence."
2320,What to expect if I have Empty sella syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Primary empty sella syndrome does not cause health problems, and it does not affect life expectancy."
2321,What are the symptoms of empyema?,"Chest pain, which worsens when you breathe in deeply (pleurisy) Dry cough Excessive sweating, especially night sweats Fever and chills General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) Shortness of breath Weight loss (unintentional)"
2322,What causes empyema?,"Empyema is usually caused by an infection that spreads from the lung. It leads to a buildup of pus in the pleural space.
There can be a pint or more of infected fluid. This fluid puts pressure on the lungs.
Risk factors include:
Bacterial pneumonia Chest surgery Lung abscess Trauma or injury to the chest
In rare cases, empyema can occur after a needle is inserted through the chest wall to draw off fluid in the pleural space for medical diagnosis or treatment (thoracentesis)."
2323,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Empyema ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of empyema.
2324,What to expect if I have Empyema  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When empyema complicates pneumonia, the risk of permanent lung damage and death goes up. Patients will need long-term treatment with antibiotics and drainage. However, most people fully recover from empyema."
2325,What are the symptoms of Encephalitis?,"Some patients may have symptoms of a cold or stomach infection before encephalitis symptoms begin.
When a case of encephalitis is not very severe, the symptoms may be similar to those of other illnesses, including:
Fever that is not very high Mild headache Low energy and a poor appetite
Other symptoms include:
Clumsiness, unsteady gait Confusion, disorientation Drowsiness Irritability or poor temper control Light sensitivity Stiff neck and back (occasionally) Vomiting
Symptoms in newborns and younger infants may not be as easy to recognize:
Body stiffness Irritability and crying more often (these symptoms may get worse when the baby is picked up) Poor feeding Soft spot on the top of the head may bulge out more Vomiting
Emergency symptoms:
Loss of consciousness, poor responsiveness, stupor, coma Muscle weakness or paralysis Seizures Severe headache Sudden change in mental functions: ""Flat"" mood, lack of mood, or mood that is inappropriate for the situation Impaired judgment Inflexibility, extreme self-centeredness, inability to make a decision, or withdrawal from social interaction Less interest in daily activities Memory loss (amnesia), impaired short-term or long-term memory"
2326,What causes Encephalitis?,"Encephalitis is a rare condition. It occurs more often in the first year of life and decreases with age. The very young and the elderly are more likely to have a severe case.
Encephalitis is most often caused by a viral infection. Many types of viruses may cause it. Exposure to viruses can occur through:
Breathing in respiratory droplets from an infected person Contaminated food or drink Mosquito, tick, and other insect bites Skin contact
Different viruses will occur in different locations. Many cases will tend to cluster in a certain season.
Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the leading cause of more severe cases in all ages, including newborns.
A number of viruses for which there is now a vaccine may also cause encephalitis. These include:
Measles Mumps Polio Rabies Rubella Varicella (chickenpox)
Other viruses that cause encephalitis include:
Adenovirus Coxsackievirus Cytomegalovirus Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Echovirus West Nile virus
The virus causes inflammation of brain tissue. The brain tissue swells (cerebral edema), which may destroy nerve cells, cause bleeding in the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage), and brain damage."
2327,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Encephalitis ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have:
Sudden fever Other symptoms of encephalitis"
2328,What to expect if I have Encephalitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies. Some cases are mild and short, and the person fully recovers. Other cases are severe, and permanent impairment or death is possible.
The acute phase normally lasts for 1 - 2 weeks. Fever and symptoms gradually or suddenly disappear. Some people may take several months to fully recover."
2329,What are the symptoms of Encopresis?,Inability to retain feces (bowel incontinence) Passing stool in inappropriate places (generally in the child's clothes) Secretive behavior associated with bowel movements Constipation and hard stools Occasional passage of very large stool that almost blocks up the toilet
2330,What causes Encopresis?,"Encopresis is frequently associated with constipation and fecal impaction. Often, hard fecal material remains in the colon and the child only passes a soft or semi-liquid stool around the impacted stool. Leakage of stool may occur during the day or night. There are rarely physical causes other than constipation (sometimes present since infancy).
Other causes may be related to:
A lack of toilet training Toilet training at too early an age Emotional disturbance such as oppositional defiant disorder Conduct disorder
Whatever the cause the child may develop associated shame, guilt, or loss of self-esteem. The child may try to hide the discovery of the problem."
2331,Who is at highest risk for Encopresis ?,"The following may increase the risk for encopresis:
Being male Chronic constipation Low socioeconomic status"
2332,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Encopresis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if this behavior is noted in a child over 4 years old.
2333,What to expect if I have Encopresis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most children respond to treatment.
2334,What are the symptoms of Endodermal sinus tumor?,"The symptoms of endodermal sinus tumor include abdominal distention, acute/sub acute abdominal pain."
2335,What to expect if I have Endodermal sinus tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis is good with treatment.
2336,What are the symptoms of Endometrial cancer?,"Possible signs of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal discharge, pain in the pelvis, bleeding or discharge not related to menstruation (periods), difficult or painful urination and pain during sexual intercourse. Since other conditions may cause the same symptoms, you should always consult your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms."
2337,Who is at highest risk for Endometrial cancer ?,"Endometrial cancer usually occurs in women after menopause, and affects more white women than black women. Black women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are more likely to have more advanced disease at diagnosis, and are more likely to die from endometrial cancer than white women.
Some of the risk factors for endometrial cancer are:
Estrogen Exposure
Estrogen exposure through estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy. A combination estrogen-progestin replacement therapy in post menopausal women, however, has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
Beginning to have menstrual periods at an early age also increases the number of years the body is exposed to estrogen and increases a woman's risk of endometrial cancer. Similarly, women who reach menopause at an older age are exposed to estrogen for a longer time and have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.
Never being pregnant is also a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for a longer time than women who have been pregnant. This increases the risk of endometrial cancer.
Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen is one of a group of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. Tamoxifen is used to prevent breast cancer in women who are at high risk for the disease, but it increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This risk is greater in postmenopausal women.
Another drug in the SERM group, raloxifene, is used to prevent bone weakness in postmenopausal women and has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
Inherited risk
Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by changes in certain genes. Women who have HNPCC syndrome have a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than women who do not have HNPCC syndrome.
Polycystic ovary syndrome
Women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (a disorder of the hormones made by the ovaries) have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.
Body fat
Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This may be because obesity is related to other risk factors such as estrogen levels, polycystic ovary syndrome, lack of physical activity, and a diet that is high in saturated fats.
It is not known if losing weight decreases the risk of endometrial cancer."
2338,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Endometrial cancer ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding or any other symptoms of endometrial cancer. This is particularly important if you have any associated risk factors or if you have not had routine pelvic exams.
Any of the following symptoms should be reported immediately to the doctor:
Bleeding or spotting after intercourse or douching Bleeding lasting longer than 7 days Periods that occur every 21 days or more Bleeding or spotting after 6 months or more of no bleeding at all"
2339,What to expect if I have Endometrial cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Endometrial cancer is usually diagnosed at an early stage. The 1-year survival rate is about 92%. The 5-year survival rate for endometrial cancer that has not spread is 95%. If the cancer has spread to distant organs, the 5-year survival rate drops to 23%."
2340,What are the symptoms of Endometritis?,"Abdominal distention or swelling Abnormal vaginal bleeding Abnormal vaginal discharge Discomfort with bowel movement (constipation may occur) Fever (100 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit) General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) Lower abdominal or pelvic pain (uterine pain)"
2341,What causes Endometritis?,"Endometritis is caused by infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, or mixtures of normal vaginal bacteria.
Endometritis is more likely to occur after miscarriage or childbirth, especially after a long labor or c-section.
A medical procedure that involves entering the uterus through the cervix will increase the risk of developing endometritis. This includes a D and C, hysteroscopy, and placement of an intrauterine device (IUD).
Endometritis can occur at the same time as other pelvic infections such as acute salpingitis, acute cervicitis, and many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)."
2342,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Endometritis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of endometritis.
Call immediately if you have symptoms and have recently had a baby, miscarriage, abortion, IUD placement, or any surgery involving the uterus."
2343,What to expect if I have Endometritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases of endometritis go away with antibiotics.
Untreated endometritis can lead to more serious infection and complications with pelvic organs, reproduction, and general health."
2344,What are the symptoms of enterobiasis?,"Itching around the anus Difficulty sleeping due to the itching that occurs during the night Irritability due to itching and interrupted sleep Irritated or infected skin around the anus, from constant scratching Loss of appetite and weight (uncommon, but can occur in severe infections)"
2345,What causes enterobiasis?,"Enterobiasis is caused by pinworms. Pinworms are the most common worm infection in the United States. They are most common in school-age children. Pinworm eggs are spread directly from person to person. They can also be spread by contamination of household items with the eggs. Typically, children are infected by unknowingly touching pinworm eggs and putting their fingers in their mouths. The eggs are swallowed and eventually, matures in the small intestine. Female worms then move to the child's anal area and lay eggs, usually at night. This may cause intense itching. The area can also be infected. When the child scratches the itching anal area, the eggs can get under the fingernails. These eggs can be transferred to other children, family members, and items in the house."
2346,Who is at highest risk for Enterobiasis ?,Children are at increased risk of having pinworm
2347,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Enterobiasis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You or your child has symptoms of pinworm infection You have seen pinworms on your child"
2348,What to expect if I have Enterobiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Pinworm infection is fully treatable.
2349,What are the symptoms of Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma?,"Some of the symptoms of EATL include: 
Abdominal pain Diarrhea Unexpected weight loss Skin lesion Fever Night sweat"
2350,What causes Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma?,"There aren't sufficient studies regarding causes of Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, in other words, it's not known causes for this disease."
2351,Who is at highest risk for Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma ?,"Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma type I is more common among those diagnosed with celiac disease, however, type II can be seen in those without celiac disease There is a male gender predilection."
2352,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma ?,"Patients who suffer from malabsorption, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, fever, night sweat must visit their primary care physicians in order to have an extensive workup done and rule out intestinal lymphoma."
2353,What to expect if I have Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis is very poor and the tumor is very aggressive in nature.
2354,What are the Symptoms of enterovirus 68?,"Most people who are infected with enterovirus 68 only develop mild disease. Symptoms may include:
Fever Runny nose Sneezing Cough Skin rash
The disease may be more severe in younger children and require hospitalization. Children may have:
Difficulty breathing Wheezing or worsening of asthma Convulsions due to high fever"
2355,What are the Causes of Enterovirus 68?,"Enterovirus 68, or HEV-D68, is the organism responsible for Enterovirus 68 infection.
The enterovirus 68 can be transmitted by droplets released from the respiratory tract when an infected person sneezes of coughs. This form of transmission may last for 1 to 3 weeks. Other bodily fluids that may contain the virus include saliva, nasal mucus, sputum, and blister fluid (in those with rash). Infected people can transmit the virus even if they don't have symptoms.
You can get exposed to the virus by:
Having close contact with infected persons, such as touching or shaking hands Touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them
If you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with contaminated hands, you can get infected with the virus. It is very important to practice good hand hygiene around people with enterovirus 68 infection."
2356,Who is at highest risk for Enterovirus 68 ?,"Anyone can get infected with enterovirus 68. But infants, children, and teenagers are more likely to get infected and become sick. Younger children can get very sick and require hospitalization following enterovirus 68 infection."
2357,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Enterovirus 68 ?,"If you are concerned about your symptoms or those of a family member, you should consider seeking medical care. Symptoms of severe respiratory disease such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, severe cough, and very high fever should be investigated by your health care provider."
2358,Where to Find Medical Care for Enterovirus 68?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Enterovirus 68 Infection
2359,What to expect if I have Enterovirus 68  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most persons with enterovirus 68 infection recover fully without any long-term health problems. In a minority of patients, particularly children, the virus may lead to a severe infection of the lungs (pneumonia) requiring hospitalization, and very rarely leading to death."
2360,What are the symptoms of Ependymoma?,"Symptoms of ependymoma include:
Headache Nausea Vomiting Blurry or double vision Drowsiness (after several hours of the above symptoms) Irritability Ataxia Neck pain Cranial nerve palsies Seizures Focal neurologic deficits. Back pain Lower extremity weakness Bowel and bladder dysfunction"
2361,What causes Ependymoma?,There are no established causes for ependymoma.
2362,Who is at highest risk for Ependymoma ?,"Children with certain hereditary diseases, such as neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), Turcot syndrome B, and MEN1 syndrome, have been found to be more frequently afflicted with ependymal tumors.
Increased occurrence of chromosome 1q and proteins such as tenascin C and epidermal growth factor are associated with increased risk for developing ependymal tumors. ERBB2, ERBB4, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT gene expression promote tumor cell proliferation, contributing to aggressive tumor behavior. High expression of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR correlates with unfavorable outcome. Over-expression of kinetochore proteins and down-regulation of metallothioneins are associated with recurrence of ependymomas."
2363,What are the symptoms of Epididymoorchitis?,"Epididymoorchitis may begin with a low-grade fever, chills, and a heavy sensation in the testicle area. The area becomes more and more sensitive to pressure.
Blood in the semen Discharge from penis Fever Groin pain Pain with intercourse or ejaculation Pain with urination (dysuria) Scrotal swelling Tender, swollen groin area on affected side Tender, swollen, heavy feeling in the testicle Testicle pain that is made worse by a bowel movement or straining"
2364,What causes Epididmyoorchitis?,"Isolated epididymitis is usually caused by the spread of a bacterial infection from the urethra or the bladder. The most common infections that cause this condition in young heterosexual men are gonorrhea and chlamydia. In children and older men,E. coli and similar infections are much more common. This is also true in homosexual men.
The most common virus that causes isolated orchitis is mumps. It most often occurs in boys after puberty. Orchitis usually develops 4 - 6 days after the mumps begins. Because of childhood vaccinations, mumps is now rare in the United States. Orchitis may also occur along with infections of the prostate or epididymis.
Epididymoorchitis is often spread of infection from isolated orchitis or isolated epididymitis and may be caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STD), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. The rate of sexually transmitted orchitis or epididymitis is higher in men ages 19 - 35. It is a major cause of hospital admissions in the miltary."
2365,Who is at highest risk for Epididymoorchitis ?,"Risk factors for sexually transmitted epididymoorchitis include:
High-risk sexual behaviors Multiple sexual partners Personal history of gonorrhea or another STD Sexual partner with a diagnosed STD
Risk factors for epididymoorchitis not due to an STD include:
Being older than age 45 Long-term use of a Foley catheter Not being vaccinated against the mumps Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract that occurred at birth (congenital) Regular urinary tract infections Surgery of the urinary tract (genitourinary surgery)"
2366,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Epididymoorchitis ?,All testicle abnormalities should be medically evaluated. Call the local emergency number (such as 911) or go to the nearest emergency room if you experience sudden pain in the testicle.
2367,What to expect if I have Epididymoorchitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Getting the right diagnosis and treatment for epididymoorchitis caused by bacteria can usually preserve the normal testicle function.
If the testicle does not completely return to normal after treatment, further testing to rule out testicular cancer should be done. If not treated, or in some other cases, the condition can become long-term (chronic). In chronic cases, there is usually no swelling, but there is pain.
Mumps orchitis cannot be treated, and the outcome can vary. Men who have had mumps orchitis can become sterile."
2368,What are the symptoms of Epidural hematoma?,"A health care provider should be consulted for any head injury that results in even a brief loss of consciousness or if there are any other symptoms after a head injury (even without loss of consciousness).
The typical pattern of symptoms that indicate an extradural hemorrhage is loss of consciousness, followed by alertness, then loss of consciousness again. But this pattern may NOT appear in all people.
The most important symptoms of an extradural hemorrhage are:
Confusion Dizziness Drowsiness or altered level of alertness Enlarged pupil in one eye Headache (severe) Head injury or trauma followed by loss of consciousness, an period of alertness, then rapid deterioration back to unconsciousness Nausea and/or vomiting Weakness of part of the body, usually on the opposite side from the side with the enlarged pupil
The symptoms usually occur within minutes to hours after a head injury and indicate an emergency situation."
2369,What causes Epidural hematoma?,"An extradural hemorrhage is often caused by a skull fracture during childhood or adolescence. This type of bleeding is more common in young people because the membrane covering the brain is not as firmly attached to the skull as it is in older people.
An extradural hemorrhage occurs when there is a rupture of a blood vessel, usually an artery, which then bleeds into the space between the dura mater and the skull. The affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures.
This is most often the result of a severe head injury, such as those caused by motorcycle or automobile accidents. Extradural hemorrhages can be caused by venous (from a vein) bleeding in young children.
Rapid bleeding causes a collection of blood (hematoma) that presses on the brain, causing a rapid increase of the pressure inside the head (intracranial pressure). This pressure may result in additional brain injury.
An extradural hemorrhage is an emergency because it may lead to permanent brain damage and death if left untreated. There may be a rapid worsening within minutes to hours, from drowsiness to coma and death."
2370,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Epidural hematoma ?,"Go to the emergency room or call 911 if symptoms of extradural hemorrhage occur.
Spinal injuries often occur with head injuries, so if you must move the person before help arrives, try to keep his or her neck still.
Call your health care provider if symptoms persist after treatment, including memory loss, difficulty maintaining attention, dizziness, headache, anxiety, speech difficulties, and complete or partial loss of movement in part of the body.
Go to the emergency room or call 911 if emergency symptoms develop after treatment, including breathing difficulties, convulsions/seizures, decreased responsiveness, loss of consciousness, enlarged pupils, and uneven pupil size."
2371,What to expect if I have Epidural hematoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"An extradural hemorrhage has a high risk of death without prompt surgical intervention. Even with prompt medical attention, a significant risk of death and disability remains."
2372,What are the symptoms of Epiglottitis?,"Epiglottitis begins with a high fever and sore throat. Other symptoms may include:
Abnormal breathing sounds (stridor) Chills, shaking Cyanosis (blue skin coloring) Drooling Difficulty breathing (patient may need to sit upright and lean slightly forward to breathe) Difficulty swallowing Voice changes (hoarseness)"
2373,What causes Epiglottitis?,"Epiglottitis is a life-threatening disease. The epiglottis is a piece of cartilage at the back of the tongue that closes off the windpipe when swallowing. It keeps food from entering the airways, so you don't cough or choke after swallowing.
Epiglottitis is swelling of the epiglottis, which leads to breathing problems. Swelling of the epiglottis is usually caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), although it may be caused by other bacteria or viruses. Upper respiratory infections can lead to epiglottitis. Medicines or diseases that weaken the immune system can make adults more prone to epiglottitis.
Epiglottitis is most common in children between 2 and 6 years old. Rarely, epiglottitis can occur in adults, and it may be easily overlooked in such patients.
The occurrence of epiglottitis has decreased dramatically in the United States since the H. influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine became a routine childhood immunization in the late 1980s."
2374,Who is at highest risk for Epiglottitis?,"Since epiglottitis is contagious, anyone around a person with epiglottitis is at risk."
2375,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Epiglottitis ?,"Call the local emergency number (such as 911) if your child has symptoms of epiglottitis, including sudden breathing difficulties, excessive drooling, and irritability."
2376,What to expect if I have Epiglottitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Epiglottitis can be a life-threatening emergency. However, with proper treatment, the outcome is usually good."
2377,What are the symptoms of Escherichia coli enteritis?,"Because there are so many types of E. coli, you can become infected and show symptoms many times. Symptoms usually develop within a few days (1-10 days) after you are infected with E. coli. It usually takes a 5-7 days before you are better. Symptoms of gastroenteritis caused by E. coli can include:
Nausea Abdominal cramps Vomiting Diarrhea, which may be watery or bloody Fatigue Fever Muscle aches"
2378,What causes Escherichia coli enteritis?,"The main bacteria that cause gastroenteritis used to be called Escherichia coli (E. coli). Although there are strains of E. coli that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract in all humans, the strains that cause enteritis are different from the strains that normally inhabit the gastrointestinal tract."
2379,What are the symptoms of Esophageal cancer?,"Early stages of esophageal cancer do not display any recognizable symptoms. As the malignant tumors grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Dysphagia: This is the most common symptom of esophageal cancer. It causes problems swallowing, with the feeling like the food is stuck in the throat or chest. At first it is often mild, but then gets worse over time. At last, patients can no longer eat and can only consume water.
Chest pain or chest burning sensation: Chest pain with swallowing may occur if the tumor is large enough to block the esophagus. Some patients describe a feeling of pressure or burning in the chest.
Hiccups: This happens because of digestive dysfunction of the esophagus.
Vomiting blood: When a tumor invades a blood vessel, vomiting up blood occurs. This may be the first symptom in some patients.
Weight loss: This occurs because swallowing problems prevent patients from eating enough to maintain their weight. Other factors include loss of appetite and increase in metabolism from the cancer.
Infections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms, but only a doctor can give a proper diagnosis. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so their problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2380,What causes Esophageal cancer?,"Esophageal cancer is not very common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old.
There are two main types of esophageal cancer that exist: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different microscopically.
Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and alcohol consumption.
Barrett's esophagus, a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), increases the risk for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. This is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Other risk factors for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus include:
Male gender Obesity Smoking"
2381,Who is at highest risk for Esophageal cancer ?,"Studies have found a number of factors that may increase the risk of esophageal cancer. These risk factors are outlined below:
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): In some people, acid can reflex from the stomach into the esophagus. This disease is called Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Clinical data show that people with GERD have a 2-16 times higher risk of getting adenocarcinoma of the esophagus than those without GERD.
Barrett's esophagus: Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the squamous cells that usually line the esophagus are replaced with glandular cells when reflux of stomach acid into the lower esophagus continues for a long period of time.
Achalasia: This is a disease in which the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus does not relax properly. As the result, food has trouble in passing into the stomach and tends to collect in the esophagus, causing the esophagus above this muscle to become dilated. People with achalasia have a risk of esophageal cancer that is at least 15 times higher than the normal risk.
Stomach bacteria: Epidemiological surveys demonstrate patients treated to get rid of H. pylori often get adenocarcinoma of the esophagus more often than expected.
Injury to the esophagus: Chemicals such as lye may cause a severe chemical burn in the esophagus. The scar tissue can make the esophagus very narrow after the injury heals. People with these narrow esophageal passages have a higher rate of the squamous cell type of esophageal cancer after several years.
Workplace exposures: Clinical surveys show exposure to chemical fumes, such as solvents used for dry cleaning, may lead to an increased risk of esophageal cancer.
Tobacco and alcohol
Diet: About 15% of esophageal cancer can be linked to a diet that is poor in fruits and vegetables.
Obesity
Gender: Men have a 3-fold higher rate of getting esophageal cancer than women.
Age: Most cases occur in those 65 years or older."
2382,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Esophageal cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of esophageal cancer develop. If you are experiencing one or several of the following symptoms, you should seek urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe dysphagia: Esophageal cancer causes problems swallowing and eventually may prevent patients from being able to swallow at all. You need to see the doctor to obtain nutritional support.
Vomiting a large amount of blood: This is the result of cancer invading the vessels of esophageal wall."
2383,What to expect if I have Esophageal cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of esophageal cancer depends on the following:
The size and location of the tumor
The stage of the cancer: Whether it affects part of the esophagus, invades the whole esophagus, or has spread to other places in the body.
The patient’s general health"
2384,What are the symptoms of Oral candidiasis?,Esophageal candidiasis causes difficult and painful swallowing especially in patients whom immunity is decreased (HIV or patients on chemotherapy).
2385,What causes Oral candidiasis?,"Esophageal candidiasis is caused by forms of a fungus called Candida. A small amount of this fungus lives in your mouth and mucous membranes most of the time. It is usually kept in check by your immune system and other types of germs that also normally live in your mouth. However, when your immune system is weaker, the fungus can grow, leading to sores (lesions) in your esophagus. The following can increase your chances of getting thrush:
Taking steroid medications Having an HIV infection or AIDS Receiving chemotherapy for cancer or drugs to suppress your immune system following an organ transplantation Being very old or very young Being in poor health"
2386,Who is at highest risk for Esophageal candidiasis ?,People who have HIV or who had organ transplant are at highest risk of having esophageal candidiasis. Also people with impaired motility of the esophagus that causes food stagnation there are highly vulnerable to esophageal candidiasis.
2387,What to expect if I have Esophageal candidiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Esophageal candidiasis usually responds to antifungal treatment but due to decreased immunity, there is a chance of recurrence. The"
2388,What are the symptoms of Esophagitis?,"The infection or irritation may cause the esophagus to become inflamed. Ulcers may form. Symptoms may include:
Difficulty swallowing Painful swallowing Heartburn (acid reflux) Hoarseness Sore throat"
2389,What causes Esophagitis?,"Esophagitis is frequently caused by the backflow of acid-containing fluid from the stomach to the esophagus, a condition called gastroesophageal reflux. An autoimmune disorder called eosinophilic esophagitis also causes this condition. 
Esophageal infection may be due to fungi, yeast (especially Candida infections), or viruses such as herpes or cytomegalovirus."
2390,Who is at highest risk for Esophagitis ?,"The following increase your risk of esophagitis:
Alcohol use Cigarette smoking Surgery or radiation to the chest (for example, treatment for lung cancer) Taking certain medications without plenty of water especially alendronate, tetracycline, doxycycline, and vitamins Vomiting
Persons with weakened immune systems due to HIV and certain medications (such as corticosteroids) may develop infections that lead to esophagitis."
2391,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Esophagitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of esophagitis.
2392,What to expect if I have Esophagitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The disorders that cause esophagitis usually respond to treatment.
2393,What are the symptoms of Essential thrombocytosis?,"Symptoms may include any of the following:
Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, urinary tract, or skin Bleeding from the gums Bleeding (prolonged) from surgical procedures or tooth removal Dizziness and headaches Easy bruising and nosebleeds (epistaxis) Numbness of the hands or feet Ulcers on the fingers or toes
The condition can even cause strokes in some people."
2394,What causes Essential thrombocytosis?,"Primary thrombocythemia is caused by the overproduction of platelets. If untreated, this condition gets worse over time. Because these platelets do not work normally, bleeding is a common problem.
The disease is part of a group of conditions known as myeloproliferative disorders. Others include:
Chronic myelogenous leukemia Polycythemia vera Primary myelofibrosis
This disorder is most common in middle aged people. It can also be seen in younger people, especially women under age 40."
2395,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Essential thrombocytosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have unexplained bleeding that continues longer than it should. You notice chest pain, leg pain, confusion, weakness, numbness, or other new symptoms."
2396,What to expect if I have Essential thrombocytosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"While outcomes can vary, most people can go for long periods without complications and have a normal lifespan. In a small number of people, complications from bleeding and blood clots can cause serious problems.
In rare cases, the disease can change into acute leukemia or myelofibrosis."
2397,What are the symptoms of Evans syndrome?,"Symptoms of carriers are as follows:
Breathlessness Feeling faint Shooting pains Faster heart rate Malaise Ulcers from mucous membrane
In autoimmune hemolytic anemia the following may be found:
Fatigue Pale skin color Shortness of breath Rapid heartbeat Yellow/jaundice colored eyes and skin Dark urine"
2398,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Evans syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of Evans syndrome develop.
2399,What are the symptoms of Lymphoma?,"Soaking night sweats Swollen, painless lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin Unexplained weight loss Fever Coughing, trouble breathing or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away Pain, swelling or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen"
2400,What causes Lymphoma?,"Non-Hodgkin lymphomas begin when a type of white blood cell, called a T cell or B cell, becomes abnormal. The cell divides again and again, making more abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can spread to almost any other part of the body. Most of the time, doctors can't determine why a person gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
2401,Who is at highest risk for Extranodal NK-T-cell lymphoma ?,"Risk factor is anything that changes your chance of getting a disease like cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable and some are nonmodifiable. Having the risk factor doesn't always mean that you will get the disease but it certainly increases your chances as compared to the general population.
Risk factors for lymphoma are as under:
Age Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people. Gender Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known. Race, Ethnicity, and Geography In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL. Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world. Family history Having a first degree relative (parent, child, sibling) with NHL increases your risk of developing NHL.
Exposure to certain chemicals Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress. Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment. Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below). Radiation exposure Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia, and thyroid cancer. Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Autoimmmune diseases Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL. Certain infections Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Helicobacter pylori Chlamydophila psittaci Campylobacter jejuni Hepatitis C Body Weight and Diet Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk. Breast implants It is rare, but some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured (rough) surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces)."
2402,What are the symptoms of Facial nerve paralysis?,"Damaged nerve leads to facial muscle paralysis. Patients with facial nerve paralysis may show the following signs:
Change in the appearance of the face
Facial droop, paralysis in one side Difficulty closing one eye and difficulty with fine movements of the face Difficulty making expressions, grimacing
Difficulty eating Face feels pulled to one side and stiff Felling dryness in the eye or the mouth Headache Pain behind the ear Alteration of taste on the affected side Hyperacusis"
2403,Who is at highest risk for Facial nerve paralysis ?,"Trauma: such as skull base fractures, facial injuries, or surgical trauma. Nervous system disease, such as Millard-Gubler syndrome Infection in the ear or face, such as Ramsey-Hunt syndrome Metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus Tumors, such as acoustic neuroma, schwannoma, glomus tumors. Toxins, such as alcohol abuse, carbon monoxide poisoning. idiopathic, such as Bell's palsy"
2404,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Facial nerve paralysis ?,Call your health care provider if you find any signs of facial nerve paralysis. Early treatment is helpful to cure your changes in the face.
2405,What to expect if I have Facial nerve paralysis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The pragnosis of facial nerve paralysis varies from person to person. It depends on:
The underlying cause: Prognosis of patients with facial nerve paralysis caused by tumors is poorer than other causes. The severity of facial nerve injuries Whether the patient is treated early or not: Early treatment may be helpful to recover. Some patient experiencing early treatment leave behind no change in the face."
2406,What are the symptoms of Failure to thrive?,"Infants or children who fail to thrive have a height, weight, and head circumference that do not match standard growth charts.
The person's weight falls lower than 3rd percentile (as outlined in standard growth charts) or 20% below the ideal weight for their height.
Growing may have slowed or stopped after a previously established growth curve.
The following are delayed or slow to develop:
Physical skills such as rolling over, sitting, standing and walking Mental and social skills Secondary sexual characteristics (delayed in adolescents)"
2407,What causes Failure to thrive?,"Infants or children that fail to thrive seem to be dramatically smaller or shorter than other children the same age. Teenagers may have short stature or appear to lack the usual changes that occur at puberty. However, there is a wide variation in normal growth and development.
In general, the rate of change in weight and height may be more important than the actual measurements.
It is important to determine whether failure to thrive results from medical problems or factors in the environment, such as abuse or neglect.
There are multiple medical causes of failure to thrive. These include:
Chromosome abnormalities such as Down syndrome and Turner syndrome Defects in major organ systems Problems with the endocrine system, such as thyroid hormone deficiency, growth hormone deficiency, or other hormone deficiencies Damage to the brain or central nervous system, which may cause feeding difficulties in an infant Heart or lung problems, which can affect how oxygen and nutrients move through the body Anemia or other blood disorders Gastrointestinal problems that result in malabsorption or a lack of digestive enzymes Long-term gastroenteritis and gastroesophageal reflux (usually temporary) Cerebral palsy Long-term (chronic) infections Metabolic disorders Complications of pregnancy and low birth weight
Other factors that may lead to failure to thrive:
Emotional deprivation as a result of parental withdrawal, rejection, or hostility Economic problems that affect nutrition, living conditions, and parental attitudes Exposure to infections, parasites, or toxins Poor eating habits, such as eating in front of the television and not having formal meal times
Many times the cause cannot be determined."
2408,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Failure to thrive ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if your child does not seem to be developing normally.
2409,What to expect if I have Failure to thrive  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If the period of failure to thrive has been short, and the cause is determined and can be corrected, normal growth and development will resume.
If failure to thrive is prolonged, the effects may be long lasting, and normal growth and development may not be achieved."
2410,What are the symptoms of Familial mediterranean fever ?,"Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15. Inflammation in the lining of the abdominal cavity, chest cavity, skin, or joints occurs, along with high fevers that usually peak in 12 to 24 hours. Attacks may vary in severity of symptoms. Patients are usually symptom -free between attacks.
Symptoms may include repeated episodes of:
Abdominal pain Chest pain that is sharp and gets worse when taking a breath Fever or alternating chills and fever Joint pain Skin lesions that are red and swollen and range from 5 - 20 cm in diameter"
2411,What are the causes of Familial mediterranean fever ?,"Familial Mediterranean fever is most often caused by a mutation in the MEFV gene. This gene creates proteins involved in inflammation.
The condition usually affects people of Mediterranean ancestry, especially non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic) Jews, Armenians, and Arabs, although people from other ethnic groups may also be affected.
This disease is very rare. Risk factors include a family history of familial Mediterranean fever or having Mediterranean ancestry."
2412,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Familial mediterranean fever ?,Call your health care provider if you or your child develop symptoms of this condition.
2413,What to expect if I have Familial mediterranean fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"There is no known cure for familial Mediterranean fever. Most people continue to have attacks, but the number and severity of attacks is different from person to person."
2414,What are the symptoms of Fat embolism syndrome?,"There is usually a latent period of 24 to 72 hours between injury and onset. The onset is then sudden. The usual symptoms include:

Narrow, small eyes with large epicanthal folds Small head Small upper jaw Smooth groove in upper lip Smooth and thin upper lip"
2423,What causes Fetal alcohol syndrome?,"Using or abusing alcohol during pregnancy can cause the same risks as using alcohol in general. However, it poses extra risks to the fetus. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it easily passes across the placenta to the fetus. Because of this, drinking alcohol can harm the baby's development.
A pregnant woman who drinks any amount of alcohol is at risk, since no ""safe"" level of alcohol use during pregnancy has been established. However, larger amounts appear to increase the problems. Binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol.
Timing of alcohol use during pregnancy is also important. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy. However, drinking alcohol anytime during pregnancy can be harmful."
2424,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Fetal alcohol syndrome ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are drinking alcohol regularly or heavily, and are finding it difficult to cut back or stop.

2426,What are the Symptoms of Fibroma ?,"Some women with fibroids have no symptoms, or have only mild symptom s, while other women have more severe, debilitating symptoms. Common symptoms for uterine fibroids include:
Heavy or prolonged menstrual periods Abnormal bleeding between menstrual periods Pelvic pain Frequent urination Low back pain Pain during intercourse Infertility
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2427,What Causes ?,"The exact cause of these tumors is unknown. Mutations in FOXL2, DICER1, STK11 are involved"
2428,Who is at highest risk for Fibroma ?,Clinical data has suggested that the development of fibroma s is related to several factors. It is estimated that up to 70 percent of women develop uterine fibroids. They are usually found in women in their 30s and 40s and typically shrink in size after menopause. Fibroids are two to five times more common in African American women than Caucasian women. Ovarian fibroma s are rare and are typically found in women in their 50s during perimenopause (transition to menopause) or postmenopause.
2429,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Fibroma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of fibroma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:

2430,How are fibromas treated?,"Treatment depends on fibroid size, symptoms, and other factors. Asymptomatic fibroids may not require treatment. Myomectomy (surgical removal of a uterine fibroid) may be performed to remove fibroids that interfere with fertility in women who want to become pregnant. Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) also is commonly performed for patients with debilitating symptoms of uterine fibroids, but it is not an option for women who are planning future pregnancies. Non-surgical uterine fibroid treatments include medications, uterine artery embolization, and focused ultrasound treatment."
2431,Where to find Medical Care for fibromas?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Ovarian cancer
2432,What to expect if I have Fibroma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of fibroma depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The stage of the cance r: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the ovaries Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred The patient’ s general health"
2433,What are the symptoms of Fifth disease?,"Characteristic red cheeks Red, lacy rash, often found on arms and legs Arthritis in older patients, sometimes causing trouble walking Low fever Cold symptoms"
2434,What causes Fifth disease?,"Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to ""just have a cold."" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic ""slapped cheek"" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash."
2435,Who is at highest risk for Fifth disease ?,"Anyone can get Fifth disease. Once anyone has had it, they become immunized against the virus. Because the virus is so common, most people acquire immunity in childhood. The disease is not very serious unless the person infected has conditions (problems with immune system, pregnancy, sickle-cell disease, anemia)"
2436,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Fifth disease ?,"Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability. Parvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious illness in persons with sickle-cell disease or similar types of chronic anemia. In such persons, parvovirus B19 can cause an acute, severe anemia. The ill person may be pale, weak, and tired, and should see his or her physician for treatment. (The typical rash of fifth disease is rarely seen in these persons.) Once the infection is controlled, the anemia resolves. Furthermore, persons who have problems with their immune systems may also develop a chronic anemia with parvovirus B19 infection that requires medical treatment. People who have leukemia or cancer, who are born with immune deficiencies, who have received an organ transplant, or who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at risk for serious illness due to parvovirus B19 infection. Occasionally, serious complications may develop from parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy. Hydrops fetalis may occur, causing spontaneous abortion."
2437,What to expect if I have Fifth disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Patient generally recover fully from the illness.
2438,What are the symptoms of Filariasis?,It can be asymptomatic. Elephantiasis (frequently in the lower extremities) Scrotal swelling Cough Fever Malaise Headache Chills Subcutaneous lumps Itching Inflammation of the lymphatics
2439,What causes Filariasis?,"Filariasis is caused by parasitic organisms called nematodes or round worms. They include:
Brugia malayi Brugia timori Loa loa Mansonella ozzardi Mansonella perstans Mansonella streptocerca Onchocerca volvulus Wuchereria bancrofti"
2440,Who is at highest risk for Filariasis ?,Repeated mosquito bites over several months to years are needed to get lymphatic filariasis. People living for a long time in tropical or sub-tropical areas where the disease is common are at the greatest risk for infection.
2441,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Filariasis ?,You should seek medical care when you experience the symptoms of the filariasis as: Filarial fever Elephantiasis Scrotal swelling Subcutaneous lumps
2442,What to expect if I have Filariasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Early cases has good prognosis. Disease can leave an individual severely disabled with genital damage or elephantiasis.
2443,What are the symptoms of Folate deficiency?,"Folic acid deficiency may cause:
Diarrhea Gray hair Mouth ulcers Peptic ulcer Poor growth Swollen tongue"
2444,What causes Folate deficiency?,"Folic acid works along with vitamin B12 and vitamin C to help the body break down, use, and create new proteins. The vitamin helps form red blood cells and produce DNA, the building block of the human body, which carries genetic information.
Folic acid is a type of B vitamin. It is water-soluble, which means it cannot be stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine.
Because folate is not stored in the body in large amounts, you need a continual supply of this vitamin through your diet to maintain normal levels.
You can get folate by eating green leafy vegetables and liver.
Causes of folate deficiency are:
Certain medications, such as phenytoin (Dilantin) Diseases in which folic acid is not absorbed as well, such as celiac disease (sprue) or alcoholism Eating overcooked food Poor diet (often seen in the poor, the elderly, and people who do not eat fresh fruits or vegetables) Excess folic acid needs during the third trimester of pregnancy Hemolytic anemia"
2445,What are the symptoms of follicular thyroid cancer?,"Early follicular thyroid cancer does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
A nodule, lump, or swelling in the neck Pain in the front of the neck Hoarseness or other voice changes Trouble swallowing Breathing problems Continuous cough
A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Diseases with similar symptoms are listed in the following:
Nodular goiter Thyroid adenoma Thyroid cysts Chronic thyroiditis"
2446,What causes follicular thyroid cancer?,People who have had radiation therapy to the neck are at higher risk. People who received radiation therapy as children are at increased risk of developing follicular thyroid cancer. Other risk factors are a family history of follicular thyroid cancer and chronic goiter.
2447,Who is at highest risk for Follicular thyroid cancer ?,"Clinical data have suggested that the development of follicular thyroid cancer is related to several factors.
A diet low in iodine: Clinical survey shows follicular thyroid cancers are more common in areas where people's diets are low in iodine. Radiation: Scientists have proven that radiation exposure is a risk factor for follicular thyroid cancer. Such radiation includes medical treatments and radiation\\ fallout from power plant accidents or nuclear weapons. Hereditary conditions: Studies show people with certain inherited medical conditions such as Gardner syndrome, Cowden disease, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at higher risk of developing follicular thyroid cancer. Gender: Contrary to other cancers, follicular thyroid cancers occur more often in women than in men. Age: Clinical data show that papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are usually found in people between the ages of 20 and 60 years."
2448,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Follicular thyroid cancer ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of thyroid cancer develop.
2449,What to expect if I have Follicular thyroid cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of follicular thyroid cancer depends on the following:
The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the thyroid gland Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The patient ’s general health"
2450,What are the symptoms of Foot-and-mouth disease?,"The incubation period for foot-and-mouth disease virus has a range between 2 and 12 days.
The disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly after two or three days; blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling; and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.
Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months as well as swelling in the testicles of mature males, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly. Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals. Some infected animals remain asymptomatic, but they nonetheless carry FMD and can transmit it to others."
2451,What causes Foot-and-mouth disease?,"Humans can be infected with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with infected animals, but this is extremely rare. Some cases were caused by laboratory accidents. Because the virus that causes FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat, except in the mouth before the meat is swallowed.
There is another viral disease with similar symptoms, commonly referred to as ""hand, foot and mouth disease"", that occurs more frequently in humans, especially in young children; the cause, Coxsackie A virus, is different from FMDV. Coxsackie A also belongs to the Picornaviridae family. Coxsackie viruses belong to the Enteroviruses within the Picornaviridae. Because FMD rarely infects humans, but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health. Farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epizootic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down."
2452,What are the symptoms of Gallstone disease?,"As gallstones move into the bile ducts and create blockage, pressure increases in the gallbladder and one or more symptoms may occur. Symptoms of blocked bile ducts are often called a gallbladder “attack” because they occur suddenly. Gallbladder attacks often follow fatty meals, and they may occur during the night. A typical attack can cause;
Steady pain in the right upper abdomen that increases rapidly and lasts from 30 minutes to several hours Pain in the back between the shoulder blades Pain under the right shoulder
Notify your doctor if you think you have experienced a gallbladder attack. Although these attacks often pass as gallstones move, your gallbladder can become infected and rupture if a blockage remains.
People with any of the following symptoms should see a doctor immediately:
Prolonged pain —more than 5 hours Nausea and vomiting Fever —even low-grade—or chills Yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes Clay-colored stools
Many people with gallstones have no symptoms; these gallstones are called “silent stones.” They do not interfere with gallbladder, liver, or pancreas function and do not need treatment."
2453,Who is at highest risk for Gallstone disease ?,"People at risk for gallstones include:
Women—especially women who are pregnant, use hormone replacement therapy, or take birth control pills People over age 60 American Indians Mexican Americans Overweight or obese men and women People who fast or lose a lot of weight quickly People with a family history of gallstones People with diabetes People who take cholesterol-lowering drugs"

2455,What to expect if I have Gallstone disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Gallstones develop in many people without causing symptoms. The chance of symptoms or complications from gallstones is about 20%. Nearly all patients (99%) who have gallbladder surgery do not have their symptoms return.
2456,What are the symptoms of Gas gangrene?,"Gas gangrene causes very painful swelling. The skin turns pale to brownish-red. If you press on the swollen area with your fingers, you may feel gas as a crackly sensation. The edges of the infected area grow so quickly that changes can be seen over a few minutes. The area may be completely destroyed.
Symptoms include:
Air under the skin (subcutaneous emphysema)
Blisters filled with brown-red fluid
Drainage from the tissues, foul-smelling brown-red or bloody fluid (serosanguineous discharge)
Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
Moderate to high fever
Moderate to severe pain around a skin injury
Pale skin color, later becoming dusky and changing to dark red or purple
Progressive swelling around a skin injury
Sweating
Vesicle formation, combining into large blisters
Yellow color to the skin (jaundice)
Note: Symptoms usually begin suddenly and quickly worsen.
If the condition is not treated, the person can develop shock with decreased blood pressure (hypotension), kidney failure, coma, and finally death."
2457,What causes Gas gangrene?,"Gas gangrene is rare in the United States. The condition is most often caused by a bacteria called Clostridium perfringens. However, it also can be caused by Group A streptococcus. Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio vulnificus can cause similar infections. Clostridium is found most everywhere. As the bacteria grow inside the body, it makes gas and harmful substances (toxins) that can damage body tissues, cells, and blood vessels.
Gas gangrene develops suddenly. It usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent surgical wound. About 1 in 5 cases occur without an irritating event. Patients most at risk for this usually have underlying blood vessel disease (atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries), diabetes, or colon cancer."
2458,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gas gangrene ?,"This is an emergency condition requiring immediate medical attention.
Call your heath care provider if you have signs of infection around a skin wound. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911), if you have symptoms of gas gangrene."

2478,What are the causes of Giardiasis ?,"Giardiasis outbreaks can occur in communities in both developed and developing countries where water supplies become contaminated with raw sewage.
It can be contracted by drinking water from lakes or streams where water-dwelling animals such as beavers and muskrats, or domestic animals such as sheep, have caused contamination. It is also spread by direct person-to-person contact, which has caused outbreaks in institutions such as day care centers.
Anything that comes into contact with feces (poop) from infected humans or animals can become contaminated with the Giardia parasite. People become infected when they swallow the parasite. It is not possible to become infected through contact with blood."
2479,Who is at highest risk for Giardiasis ?,"Though giardiasis is commonly thought of as a camping or backpacking-related disease and is sometimes called ""Beaver Fever,"" anyone can get giardiasis. People more likely to become infected include:
Children in child care settings, especially diaper-aged children Close contacts (for example, people living in the same household) or people who care for those sick with giardiasis People who drink water or use ice made from places where Giardia may live (for example, untreated or improperly treated water from lakes, streams, or wells) Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unsafe water or who do not practice good hygiene (for example, proper handwashing) People who swallow water while swimming and playing in recreational water where Giardia may live, especially in lakes, rivers, springs, ponds, and streams International travelers People exposed to human feces (poop) through sexual contact"

Heavy bleeding during and after surgery Bleeding gums Bruising easily Heavy menstrual bleeding Nosebleeds that do not stop easily Prolonged bleeding with minor injuries"
2485,What causes Glanzmann's thrombasthenia?,"Glanzmann disease is caused by the lack of a protein that is normally on the surface of platelets. This substance is needed for platelets to clump together to form blood clots.
The condition is congenital, which means it is present from birth. There are several genetic abnormalities that can cause the condition."
2486,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Glanzmann%27s thrombasthenia ?,"Call your health care provider if:

2493,What are the symptoms of Glaucoma?,"Symptoms of glaucoma vary greatly, depending on the type of disease present.
Open-angle glaucoma
Most people have no symptoms until they begin to lose vision Gradual loss of peripheral (side) vision (also called tunnel vision)
Angle-closure glaucoma
Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse Sudden, severe pain in one eye Decreased or cloudy vision Nausea and vomiting Rainbow-like halos around lights Red eye Eye feels swollen
Low-tension or normal-tension glaucoma
Narrowed side vision in people with normal eye pressure
Congenital glaucoma
Symptoms are usually noticed when the child is a few months old Cloudiness of the front of the eye Enlargement of one eye or both eyes Red eye Sensitivity to light Excessive Tearing"
2494,What causes Glaucoma?,"The four major types of glaucoma have their own unique causes. However, before reviewing them, a brief overview of the anatomy of the eye may be helpful in understanding the causes of this disease:
The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is always being made in the back of the eye. It leaves the eye through channels in the front of the eye in an area called the anterior chamber angle, or simply the angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid out of the eye will cause pressure to build up in the eye. This pressure is called intraocular pressure (IOP). In most cases of glaucoma, this pressure is high and causes damage to the major nerve in the eye, called the optic nerve.
More specific causes by each major type of glaucoma are:
Open-angle (chronic) glaucoma
The cause is unknown. An increase in eye pressure occurs slowly over time. The pressure pushes on the optic nerve and the retina at the back of the eye. Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are at particularly high risk for this disease.
Angle-closure (acute) glaucoma
It occurs when the exit of the aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked. Dilating eye drops and certain medications may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.
Congenital glaucoma'
It is present at birth and results from the abnormal development of the fluid outflow channels in the eye. It is often hereditary and tends to run in families.
Secondary glaucoma
It is caused as complications of other medical conditions and/or procedures, including eye surgery, advanced cataracts, eye injuries, certain eye tumors, and uveitis. It can be caused by drugs such as corticosteroids, which are used to treat eye inflammations. Pigmentary glaucoma is caused when pigment from the iris breaks off, thereby slowing the fluid drainage and blocking the meshwork. Neovascular glaucoma is a severe form of secondary glaucoma that is linked to diabetes."
2495,Who is at highest risk for Glaucoma ?,"Anyone can develop glaucoma, however some people are at higher risk than others. The most important risk factor for glaucoma is ocular hypertension. Individuals at a higher risk of developing glaucoma include:
African Americans over age 40. Everyone over age 60, especially Mexican Americans. People with a family history of glaucoma.
Among African Americans, studies show that glaucoma is:
Five times more likely to occur in African Americans than in Caucasians. About four times more likely to cause blindness in African Americans than in Caucasians. Fifteen times more likely to cause blindness in African Americans between the ages of 45-64 than in Caucasians of the same age group.
A comprehensive dilated eye exam can reveal more risk factors, such as:
High eye pressure Thinness of the cornea Abnormal optic nerve anatomy.
In some people with certain combinations of these high-risk factors, medicines in the form of eye drops reduce the risk of developing glaucoma by about half."
2496,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Glaucoma ?,"Call your health care provider if you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, especially loss of peripheral vision.
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have risk factors for glaucoma and have not been screened for the condition."
2497,What to expect if I have Glaucoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Untreated glaucoma leads to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which can progress to blindness.
The outlook of the disease varies by type: Open-angle glaucoma With good care, most patients with open-angle glaucoma can manage their condition and will not lose vision, but the condition cannot be cured. It's important to carefully and regularly follow up with your doctor.
Angle-closure glaucoma Rapid diagnosis and treatment of an attack is key to saving your vision. Seek emergency care immediately if you have symptoms of an angle-closure attack, as blindness will occur in a few days if it is not treated.
Congenital glaucoma Early diagnosis and treatment is important. If surgery is done early enough, many patients will have no future problems."
2498,What are the symptoms of Glomerulonephritis?,"Common symptoms of glomerulonephritis are:
Blood in the urine (dark, rust-colored, or brown urine) Foamy urine (due to excess protein in the urine) Swelling (edema) of the face, eyes, ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen
Symptoms may also include the following:
Abdominal pain Blood in the vomit or stools Cough and shortness of breath Diarrhea Excessive urination Fever General ill feeling, fatigue, and loss of appetite Joint or muscle aches Nosebleed"
2499,What are the causes of Glomerulonephritis?,"Glomerulonephritis may be caused by problems with the body's immune system. Often, the exact cause of glomerulonephritis is unknown. Damage to the glomeruli causes blood and protein to be lost in the urine. The condition may develop quickly and kidney function is lost within weeks or months (called rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis). A quarter of people with chronic glomerulonephritis have no history of kidney disease."
2500,Who is at highest risk for Glomerular disease ?,"The following may increase your risk of this condition:
Blood or lymphatic system disorders Exposure to hydrocarbon solvents History of cancer Infections such as strep infections, viruses, heart infections, or abscesses
Many conditions cause or increase the risk for glomerulonephritis, including:

Chronic kidney failure Reduced kidney function End-stage kidney disease
If you have nephrotic syndrome and it can be controlled, you may also be able to control other symptoms. If it cannot be controlled, you may develop end-stage kidney disease."
2503,What are the symptoms of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,"Persons with this condition do not display any signs of the disease until their red blood cells are exposed to certain chemicals in food or medicine, or to stress.
Symptoms are more common in men and may include:
Dark urine Enlarged spleen Fatigue Pallor Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Yellow skin color (jaundice)"
2504,What causes Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,"G6PD deficiency occurs when a person is missing or doesn't have enough of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which helps red blood cells work properly.
Too little G6PD leads to the destruction of red blood cells. This process is called hemolysis. When this process is actively occurring, it is called a hemolytic episode. The episodes are usually brief, because the body continues to produce new red blood cells, which have normal activity.
Red blood cell destruction can be triggered by infections, severe stress, certain foods (such as fava beans), and certain drugs, including:
Antimalarial drugs Aspirin Nitrofurantoin Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Quinidine Quinine Sulfa drugs Other chemicals, such as those in mothballs, can also trigger an episode.
In the United States, G6PD deficiency is more common among blacks than whites. Men are more likely to have this disorder than women.
A form of this disorder is common in whites of Mediterranean descent. This form is also associated with acute episodes of hemolysis. Episodes are longer and more severe than in the other types of the disorder."
2505,Who is at highest risk for Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"You are more likely to develop this condition if you:
Are African American Are of Middle Eastern decent, particularly Kurdish or Sephardic Jewish Are male Have a family history of the deficiency"

2508,What are the symptoms of (Goitre)?,"Not all goiters cause signs and symptoms. When symptoms do occur they may include:
A visible swelling at the base of your neck, the size may range from a single small nodule to large neck lump. A tight feeling in your throat Cough Hoarseness Difficulty swallowing Shortness of breath Fatigue Increased appetite Nervousness Restlessness Weight loss Muscle cramps"
2509,Who is at highest risk for Goitre ?,"Goiters can affect anyone. Some common risk factors for goiter include:
A lack of dietary iodine: Epidemical data show that people living in areas lack of iodine and not getting enough iodine in the diet are at high risk of goiter. Female gender: Studies demonstrate that women are more likely to thyroid disorders than men. Age over 50 years Personnal or family history: A personal or family history of autoimmune disease increases your risk. Certain medications: Some drugs, such as immunosuppressants, antiretrovirals, amiodarone for arrhythmia and lithium for psychiatric disorders, may increase the risk of developing goitre. Radiation: Clinical surveys demonstrate the risk increases when patients have been treated with radiation to the neck or chest area, even when they have been exposed to radiation in a nuclear facility, test or accident."
2510,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Goitre ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of this disorder. Follow the health care provider's recommendations for follow-up visits.
2511,What to expect if I have Goitre  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of goitre depends on the causes of the disease. The outcome of goitre caused by the thyroid cancer is worse than prognosis caused by other diseases, such as Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease and iodine deficiency."

2519,What causes Graves' disease?,"The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system. It is located in the front of the neck just below the voice box. This gland releases the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which control body metabolism. Controlling metabolism is critical for regulating mood, weight, and mental and physical energy levels.
If the body makes too much thyroid hormone, the condition is called hyperthyroidism."
2520,Who is at highest risk for Graves%27 disease ?,"Scientists don’t know exactly why some people develop Graves’ disease, but they believe factors such as age, sex, heredity, and emotional and environmental stress are involved.
Graves’ disease usually occurs in people younger than age 40 and is five to 10 times more common in women than men. An individual’s chance of developing Graves’ disease increases if other family members have it.
Researchers have not been able to find a specific gene that causes the disease to be passed from one generation to the next. Scientists know that some people inherit an immune system that can make antibodies against healthy cells, but predicting who will be affected is difficult.
People with other autoimmune diseases have an increased chance of developing Graves’ disease. Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and vitiligo—a disorder in which some parts of the skin are not pigmented—are among the conditions associated with Graves’ disease."
2521,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Graves%27 disease ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of Graves disease. Also call if your eye problems or general symptoms get worse (or do not improve) with treatment.

2523,What causes Group B streptococcal infection?,"The term septicemia refers to an infection in the bloodstream that may travel to different body organs. Group B streptococcal septicemia is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae, which is commonly called group B strep or GBS.
A newborn with septicemia is very sick.
GBS is commonly found in adults and older children, where it does not usually cause infection.
There are two ways in which it may be passed to a newborn baby:
The infant can become infected as he or she passes through the birth canal. In this case, babies become ill between birth and 6 days of life (most often in the first 24 hours). This is called early-onset GBS disease. The infant may also become infected after delivery by coming into contact with people who carry the GBS germ. In this case symptoms appear later, when the baby is 7 days to 3 months or more old. This is called late-onset GBS disease.
GBS now occurs less often, because methods to screen and treat pregnant women at risk are now being used."
2524,Who is at highest risk for Group B streptococcal infection ?,"The following increase an infant's risk for group B streptococcal septicemia:
History of giving birth to a baby with GBS sepsis Mother who has a fever (over 100.4 degrees F) during labor Mother who has group B streptococcus in her gastrointestinal, reproductive, or urinary tract Prematurity Rupture of membranes (water breaks) more than 18 hours before baby is delivered Use of intrauterine fetal monitoring (scalp lead) during labor"
2525,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Group B streptococcal infection ?,"This disease is usually diagnosed shortly after birth, often while the baby is still in the hospital.
However, if you have a newborn at home who shows symptoms of this condition, seek immediate emergency medical help or call the local emergency number (such as 911).
Parents should particularly watch for symptoms in their baby's first 6 weeks. The early stages of this disease can produce subtle symptoms."
2526,What to expect if I have Group B streptococcal infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,This disease can be deadly without prompt treatment.
2527,What are the symptoms of Group B streptococcal septicemia of the newborn?,"Anxious or stressed appearance Blue appearance (cyanosis) Breathing difficulties such as:
Grunting noises Flaring of the nostrils Rapid breathing Short periods without breathing
Irregular heart rate - may be fast or extremely slow Lethargy Pale appearance (pallor) with cold skin Poor feeding Unstable body temperature (low or high)"
2528,What causes Group B streptococcal septicemia of the newborn?,"The term septicemia refers to an infection in the bloodstream that may travel to different body organs. Group B streptococcal septicemia is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae, which is commonly called ""group B strep"" or GBS. A newborn with septicemia is very sick.
GBS is commonly found in adults and older children, where it does not usually cause infection. There are two ways in which it may be passed to a newborn baby:
The infant can become infected as he or she passes through the birth canal. In this case, babies become ill between birth and 6 days of life (most often in the first 24 hours). This is called early-onset GBS disease. The infant may also become infected after delivery by coming into contact with people who carry the GBS germ. In this case symptoms appear later, when the baby is 7 days to 3 months or more old. This is called late-onset GBS disease.
GBS now occurs less often, because methods to screen and treat pregnant women at risk are now being used.
The following increase an infant's risk for group B streptococcal septicemia:
History of giving birth to a baby with GBS sepsis Mother who has a fever (over 100.4 degrees F) during labor Mother who has group B streptococcus in her gastrointestinal, reproductive, or urinary tract Prematurity Rupture of membranes (""water breaks"") more than 18 hours before baby is delivered Use of intrauterine fetal monitoring (scalp lead) during labor"
2529,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Group B streptococcal septicemia of the newborn ?,"This disease is usually diagnosed shortly after birth, often while the baby is still in the hospital.
However, if you have a newborn at home who shows symptoms of this condition, seek immediate emergency medical help or call the local emergency number (such as 911).
Parents should particularly watch for symptoms in their baby's first 6 weeks. The early stages of this disease can produce subtle symptoms."
2530,What to expect if I have Group B streptococcal septicemia of the newborn  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,This disease can be deadly without prompt treatment.
2531,What are the symptoms of growth hormone deficiency?,"In the past, people thought growth hormone deficiency may affect only in children. Until recently, few people realized the importance of growth hormone to an adult body.
Growth hormone deficiency in children Many children with growth hormone deficiency grow normally until the age of two or three and then begin to show signs of delayed growth about 2 inches a year. They may have low weight than their peers, although some on the higher percentile in weight. These children have normal body proportions and look younger than their peers. Growth hormone deficiency in adults More fat: With this deficiency, fat is deposited more easily around the middle of the abdomen. Less muscle: Since growth hormone affects muscles, patients with growth hormone deficiency may feel less muscle and less ability to exercise. Less bone structure: Patients with growth hormone deficiency may occur weakening osteoporosis. Less mental functions and social activities: Most growth hormone deficiency adults notice a decrease in their energy level and endurance for exercise. They may avoid social contact, even avoid meeting with or talking to their friends. Some patients may have deficient interest in sexual activity. Some may show the sign of hypomnesia."
2532,Who is at highest risk for Growth hormone deficiency ?,"Mutations of specific genes Congenital dysfunction of hypothalamus or pituitary Any damage to pituitary, such as tumor, surgery or radiation therapy for brain tumor Head injury or trauma Ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction from low blood pressure (Sheehan syndrome), or hemorrhage pituitary apoplexy."
2533,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Growth hormone deficiency ?,Call your health care provider to identify the cause of growth hormone deficiency if your child seems abnormally.
2534,What to expect if I have Growth hormone deficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of growth hormone deficiency depends on:
When to start to treat the children: The earlier the condition is diagnosed and treated, the better the chance may be for the child. Patients' reaction to growth hormone replacement therapy: Some children get good reactions to growth hormone replacement therapy. But it seems the treatment does not work in other children."
2535,What are the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Symptoms of Guillain-Barré can get worse very quickly. It may take only a few hours to reach the most severe symptoms, but weakness increasing over several days is also common. {{#ev:youtube|opA_X34IoWk}}
Muscle weakness or the loss of muscle function (paralysis) affects both sides of the body. In most cases, the muscle weakness starts in the legs and then spreads to the arms. This is called ascending paralysis.
Patients may notice tingling, foot or hand pain, and clumsiness. If the inflammation affects the nerves to the diaphragm, and there is weakness in those muscles, the person may need breathing assistance.
Typical symptoms include:
Loss of reflexes in the arms and legs Muscle weakness or loss of muscle function (paralysis) In mild cases, there may be no weakness or paralysis May begin in the arms and legs at the same time May get worse over 24 to 72 hours May occur in the nerves of the head only May start in the arms and move downward May start in the feet and legs and move up to the arms and head Numbness, decreased sensation Sensation changes Tenderness or muscle pain (may be a cramp -like pain) Uncoordinated movement
Additional symptoms may include:
Blurred vision Clumsiness and falling Difficulty moving face muscles Muscle contractions Palpitations (sensation of feeling heartbeat)
Emergency symptoms (seek immediate medical help):
Breathing temporarily stops Can't take a deep breath Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Drooling Fainting Feeling light-headed when standing"
2536,What causes Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune disorder (the body's immune system attacks itself). Exactly what triggers Guillain-Barré syndrome is unknown. The syndrome may occur at any age, but is most common in people of both sexes between ages 30 and 50.
It often follows a minor infection, usually a lung infection or gastrointestinal infection. Usually, signs of the original infection have disappeared before the symptoms of Guillain-Barre begin.
Guillain-Barré syndrome causes inflammation that damages parts of nerves. This nerve damage causes tingling, muscle weakness, and paralysis. The inflammation usually affects the nerve's covering (myelin sheath). Such damage is called demyelination. Demyelination slows nerve signaling. Damage to other parts of the nerve can cause the nerve to stop working.
Guillain-Barré syndrome may occur along with viral infections such as:
AIDS Herpes simplex Mononucleosis
It may also occur with other medical conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus or Hodgkin's disease.
Some people may get Guillain-Barré syndrome after a bacterial infection or certain vaccinations (such as rabies and swine flu). A similar syndrome may occur after surgery, or when critically ill."
2537,Who is at highest risk for Guillain-Barr%C3%A9 syndrome ?,"An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people, or 1-2 cases for every 100,000 people, develop GBS each year in the US. Most cases of GBS tend to occur for no known reason, and true “clusters” of cases of GBS are very unusual. If you have concerns about the number of GBS cases in your area, notify the state or local health department in the state where the cases happen. CDC collaborates with state and local health departments to investigate reports of possibly unusually large numbers or “clusters” of GBS cases."
2538,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Guillain-Barr%C3%A9 syndrome ?,"Seek immediate medical help if you have any of the following symptoms:
Can't take a deep breath Decreased feeling (sensation) Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Fainting Loss of movement"
2539,What to expect if I have Guillain-Barr%C3%A9 syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Recovery can take weeks or years. Most people survive and recover completely. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, about 30% of patients still have some weakness after 3 years. Mild weakness may persist for some people.
A patient's outcome is most likely to be very good when the symptoms go away within 3 weeks after they first started."
2540,What are the symptoms of Haemophilus influenzae infection ?,"Haemophilus influenzae, including Hib, disease causes different symptoms depending on which part of the body is affected. The most common severe types of H. influenzae disease are:
Pneumonia (lung infection) Fever and chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sweating Chest pain Headache Muscle pain or aches Excessive tiredness Bacteremia (bloodstream infection) Fever and chills Excessive tiredness Pain in the belly Nausea with or without vomiting Diarrhea Anxiety Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Altered mental status (confusion) Meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord) Fever Headache Stiff neck Nausea with or without vomiting Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) Altered mental status (confusion)"
2541,What are the causes of Haemophilus influenzae infection ?,"Haemophilus influenzae disease is caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. There are six identifiable types of H. influenzae (a through f) and other non-identifiable types (called nontypeable). The one that people are most familiar with is H. influenzae type b, or Hib. These bacteria live in the nose and throat, and usually cause no harm. However, the bacteria can sometimes move to other parts of the body and cause infection. Some of these infections are considered “invasive” and can be very serious and sometimes even deadly."
2542,What are the symptoms of Hairy cell leukemia?,Easy bruising or bleeding Excessive sweating (especially at night) Fatigue Feeling full after eating only a small amount Recurrent infections and fevers Swollen lymph glands Weakness Weight loss
2543,What causes Hairy cell leukemia?,"HCL is caused by the abnormal growth of B cells. The cells look ""hairy"" under the microscope because they have fine projections coming from their surface.
HCL can lead to low numbers of normal blood cells.
The cause of this disease is unknown. It affects men more often than women. The average age of diagnosis is 55."
2544,What to expect if I have Hairy cell leukemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,More recent chemotherapy treatments have greatly improved the survival of patients with hairy cell leukemia. Most patients with hairy cell leukemia can expect to live 10 years or longer after diagnosis.
2545,What causes Hallucination?,"There are many causes of hallucinations, including:
Being drunk or high, or coming down from such drugs as marijuana, LSD, cocaine (including crack), PCP, amphetamines, heroin, ketamine, and alcohol. Delirium or dementia (visual hallucinations are most common) Epilepsy that involves a part of the brain called the temporal lobe (odor hallucinations are most common) Fever, especially in children and the elderly Narcolepsy Psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and psychotic depression Sensory problem, such as blindness or deafness Severe illness, including liver failure, kidney failure, AIDS, and brain cancer"
2546,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hallucination ?,"A person who begins to hallucinate and is detached from reality should get checked by a health care professional right away. Many medical and psychiatric conditions that can cause hallucinations may quickly become emergencies.
A person who begins to hallucinate may become nervous, paranoid, and frightened, and should not be left alone.
Call your health care provider, go to the emergency room, or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if someone appears to be hallucinating and is unable to tell hallucinations from reality."
2547,What are the symptoms of Hamartoma?,Symptoms depend upon the site of the lesion and they may present at any time from birth to middle age but usually early in life.
2548,What causes Hamartoma?,"Hamartomas result from an abnormal formation of normal tissue, although the underlying reasons for the abnormality are not fully understood. They grow along with, and at the same rate as, the organ from whose tissue they are made, and, unlike cancerous tumors, only rarely invade or compress surrounding structures significantly."
2549,Who is at highest risk for Hamartoma ?,"People with family history of a hamartomatous syndrome, such as Cowden's disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Proteus syndrome."
2550,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hamartoma ?,"Ask your doctor about the risks of a biopsy versus monitoring the size of the hamartoma with regular x-rays.
Reasons for a biopsy or removing the nodule may include:
Smoking. The nodule size has grown compared to earlier x-rays. A CT scan suggests the lesion is malignant (cancerous)."
2551,What to expect if I have Hamartoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hamartomas are generally benign, they can cause problems due to their location."
2552,What are the symptoms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"Many people with Hashimoto’s disease have no symptoms at first. As the disease slowly progresses, the thyroid usually enlarges and may cause the front of the neck to look swollen. The enlarged gland, called a goiter, may create a feeling of fullness in the throat but is usually not painful. After years, or even decades, the damage to the thyroid causes it to shrink and the goiter to disappear. Not everyone with Hashimoto’s disease develops hypothyroidism. For those who do, the hypothyroidism may be subclinical —mild and without symptoms. Other people have one or more of these common symptoms of hypothyroidism:
Fatigue Weight gain Cold intolerance Joint and muscle pain Constipation Dry, thin hair Heavy or irregular menstrual periods and impaired fertility Depression A slowed heart rate"
2553,What are the causes of Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"Chronic thyroiditis or Hashimoto's disease is a common thyroid gland disorder. It can occur at any age, but is most often seen in middle-aged women. It is caused by a reaction of the immune system against the thyroid gland. The disease begins slowly. It may take months or even years for the condition to be detected. Chronic thyroiditis is most common in women and people with a family history of thyroid disease. It affects between 0.1% and 5% of all adults in Western countries. Hashimoto's disease may, in rare cases, be associated with other endocrine disorders caused by the immune system. Hashimoto's disease can occur with adrenal insufficiency and type 1 diabetes. In these cases, the condition is called type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA II). Less commonly, Hashimoto's disease occurs as part of a condition called type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA I), along with:
Adrenal insufficiency Fungal infections of the mouth and nails Hypoparathyroidism"
2554,Who is at highest risk for Hashimoto%27s thyroiditis ?,"Hashimoto’s disease is about seven times more common in women than men. Although it often occurs in adolescent or young women, the disease more commonly appears between 40 and 60 years of age. Hashimoto’s disease tends to run in families. Scientists are working to identify the gene or genes that cause the disease to be passed from one generation to the next. Possible environmental influences are also being studied. For example, researchers have found that excess iodine consumption may inhibit thyroid hormone production in susceptible individuals. Certain drugs or viral infections may also contribute to autoimmune thyroid diseases. People with other autoimmune disorders are more likely to develop Hashimoto’s disease and vice versa. These disorders include:
Vitiligo, a condition in which some areas of the skin lose their natural color Rheumatoid arthritis Addison’s disease, in which the adrenal glands are damaged and cannot produce enough of certain critical hormones Type 1 diabetes Pernicious anemia, a type of anemia caused by inadequate vitamin B12 in the body"
2555,What are the symptoms of Head and neck cancer?,"Symptoms include:
A lump or sore that does not heal A sore throat that does not go away Trouble swallowing A change or hoarseness in the voice
Other symptoms may include the following:
Oral cavity. A white or red patch on the gums, tongue, or lining of the mouth; a swelling of the jaw that causes dentures to fit poorly or become uncomfortable; and unusual bleeding or pain in the mouth. Nasal cavity and sinuses. Sinuses that are blocked and do not clear, chronic sinus infections that do not respond to treatment with antibiotics, bleeding through the nose, frequent headaches, swelling or other trouble with the eyes, pain in the upper teeth, or problems with dentures. Salivary glands. Swelling under the chin or around the jawbone; numbness or paralysis of the muscles in the face; or pain that does not go away in the face, chin, or neck. Oropharynx and hypopharynx. Ear pain. Nasopharynx. Trouble breathing or speaking, frequent headaches, pain or ringing in the ears, or trouble hearing. Larynx. Pain when swallowing, or ear pain. Metastatic squamous neck cancer. Pain in the neck or throat that does not go away.
These symptoms may be caused by cancer or by other, less serious conditions. It is important to check with a doctor or dentist about any of these symptoms."
2556,Who is at highest risk for Head and neck cancer ?,"Tobacco (including smokeless tobacco, sometimes called “chewing tobacco” or “snuff”) and alcohol use are the most important risk factors for head and neck cancers, particularly those of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Eighty-five percent of head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk for developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone.
Other risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:
Oral cavity. Sun exposure (lip); possibly human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salivary glands. Radiation to the head and neck. This exposure can come from diagnostic x-rays or from radiation therapy for noncancerous conditions or cancer. Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Certain industrial exposures, such as wood or nickel dust inhalation. Tobacco and alcohol use may play less of a role in this type of cancer. Nasopharynx. Asian, particularly Chinese, ancestry; Epstein-Barr virus infection; occupational exposure to wood dust; and consumption of certain preservatives or salted foods. Oropharynx. Poor oral hygiene; HPV infection and the use of mouthwash that has a high alcohol content are possible, but not proven, risk factors. Hypopharynx. Plummer-Vinson (also called Paterson-Kelly) syndrome, a rare disorder that results from iron and other nutritional deficiencies. This syndrome is characterized by severe anemia and leads to difficulty swallowing due to webs of tissue that grow across the upper part of the esophagus. Larynx. Exposure to airborne particles of asbestos, especially in the workplace.
Immigrants from Southeast Asia who use paan (betel quid) in the mouth should be aware that this habit has been strongly associated with an increased risk for oral cancer. Also, consumption of mate, a tea-like beverage habitually consumed by South Americans, has been associated with an increased risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and larynx.
People who are at risk for head and neck cancers should talk with their doctor about ways they can reduce their risk. They should also discuss how often to have checkups."
2557,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Head and neck cancer ?,"Since cancers are capable of spreading to other parts of the body, it is crucial to see a doctor right away if any of the aforementioned symptoms arise."
2558,What to expect if I have Head and neck cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Although early-stage head and neck cancers (especially laryngeal and oral cavity) have high cure rates, up to 50% of head and neck cancer patients present with advanced disease.  Cure rates decrease in locally advanced cases, whose probability of cure is inversely related to tumor size and even more so to the extent of regional node involvement.
Consensus panels in America (American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC and Europe) have established staging systems for head and neck squamous cancers. These staging systems attempt to standardize clinical trial criteria for research studies, and attempt to define prognostic categories of disease. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are staged according to the TNM classification system, where T is the size and configuration of the tumor, N is the presence or absence of lymph node metastases, and M is the presence or absence of distant metastases. The T, N, and M characteristics are combined to produce a “stage” of the cancer, from I to IVB. 
Even after successful definitive therapy, head and neck cancer patients face tremendous impacts on quality of life. Despite marked advances in reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and conservation approaches to certain malignancies, some patients continue to have significant functional deficits.
Survival advantages provided by new treatment modalities have been undermined by the significant percentage of patients cured of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who subsequently develop second primary tumors. The incidence of second primary tumors ranges in studies from 9.1%  to 23%  at 20 years. Second primary tumors are the major threat to long-term survival after successful therapy of early-stage HNSCC. Their high incidence results from the same carcinogenic exposure responsible for the initial primary process, called field cancerization.
Throat cancer has numerous negative effects on the body systems.
As it can impair a person’s ability to swallow and eat, throat cancer affects the digestive system. The difficulty in swallowing can lead to a person to choke on their food in the early stages of digestion and interfere with the food’s smooth travels down into the esophagus and beyond.
The treatments for throat cancer can also be harmful to the digestive system as well as other body systems. Radiation therapy can lead to nausea and vomiting, which can deprive a body of vital fluids (although these may be obtained through intravenous fluids if necessary). Frequent vomiting can lead to an electrolyte imbalance which has serious consequences for the proper functioning of the heart. Frequent vomiting can also upset the balance of stomach acids which has a negative impact on the digestive system, especially the lining of the stomach and esophagus.
In the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the mouth and behind the nose may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and interfering with the person’s ability to breathe; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to lung cancer. If the respiratory system is unable to bring oxygen into the body, the oxygen deprivation will cause the body's cells to wither and die, causing one to become weaker and sicker.
Like any cancer, metastasization affects many areas of the body, as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and organ to organ. For example, if it spreads to the bone marrow, it will prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells and affects the proper functioning of the white blood cells and the body's immune system; spreading to the circulatory system will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer can throw the nervous system into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body."
2559,What are the symptoms of HELLP syndrome?,Fatigue or feeling unwell Fluid retention and excess weight gain Headache Nausea and vomiting that continues to get worse Pain in the upper right part of the abdomen Blurry vision Nosebleed or other bleeding that won't stop easily (rare) Seizures or convulsions (rare)
2560,What causes HELLP syndrome?,"A cause for HELLP syndrome has not been found.
HELLP syndrome occurs in about 1 to 2 out of 1,000 pregnancies, and in 10-20% of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.
Most often HELLP develops before the pregnancy is 37 weeks along. Sometimes it can develop in the week after the baby is born.
Many women have high blood pressure and are diagnosed with preeclampsia before they develop HELLP syndrome.
However, in some cases, HELLP symptoms are the first warning of preeclampsia and the condition is misdiagnosed as:
Flu or other viral illness Gallbladder disease Hepatitis Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Lupus flare Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura"
2561,When to seek urgent medical care when I have HELLP syndrome ?,"If symptoms of HELLP syndrome occur during pregnancy:
See your obstetrician immediately Call the local emergency number (such as 911) Get to the emergency room
Although there is no known way to prevent HELLP syndrome, it is important for all pregnant women to start prenatal care early and continue it through the pregnancy. This allows the health care provider to find and treat conditions such as HELLP syndrome early."
2562,What to expect if I have HELLP syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When the disease is not treated early, up to 1 out of 4 women develop serious complications. Without treatment, a small number of women die.
The death rate among babies born to mothers with HELLP syndrome depends on birth weight and the development of the baby's organs, especially the lungs.
HELLP syndrome may return in up to 1 out of 4 future pregnancies."
2563,What are the symptoms of Hemochromatosis?,"Hemochromatosis can have a variety of symptoms and symptoms may be different for men and women. Hemochromatosis can be hard to identify because early symptoms are similar to those of many other common diseases.
Although most people reach middle-age before they have symptoms of hemochromatosis, some people may have symptoms at a younger age. The symptoms depend on which organs are being affected by the iron buildup.
Early indications of hemochromatosis are often like those of other diseases and include the following symptoms:
Fatigue (feeling very tired) Weakness Weight loss Abdominal pain Joint pain
As iron builds up in the body organs, hemochromatosis may also produce the following symptoms:
Loss of menstrual periods or early menopause Loss of sex drive (libido) or impotence Loss of body hair Shortness of breath
Although not a physical symptom, another possible indication of hemochromatosis is having an elevated liver enzyme test.
As the disease progresses, hemochromatosis may cause the following more serious problems:
Arthritis Liver problems, such as cirrhosis (or scarring of the liver) and liver cancer High blood sugar and diabetes Abdominal pain that does not go away Severe fatigue (feeling extremely tired and having a lack of energy) Heart problems (such as a heart beat that is not regular) Heart failure (such as the heart not pumping blood as well as it did previously) Gray-colored or bronze-colored skin"
2564,What causes Hemochromatosis?,"The amount of iron the human body absorbs is controlled by many genes. Genes can sometimes change (or mutate) in ways that keep them from working properly.
Hereditary hemochromatosis can occur when a person inherits two mutated copies of a gene called the HFE gene — one from each parent. Men and women have the same chance of inheriting two copies of this gene.
Not everyone who is born with two copies of the mutated HFE gene develops the disease. Scientists do not know what percentage of people who have two copies of the mutated HFE gene develop the disease. Some studies have shown that as few as 1 in 100 people will develop symptoms. Other studies have shown that as many as 50 in 100 people may develop symptoms. A person with only one copy of the mutated HFE gene is usually healthy and is said to be a “carrier” of the genetic condition. Although a carrier usually does not have hemochromatosis, if both a mother and father are carriers, a child may inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent."
2565,Who is at highest risk for Hemochromatosis ?,"People who inherit the HFE gene mutation from both parents are at the greatest risk for developing hemochromatosis. Although both men and women can inherit the gene defect, men are more likely to be diagnosed with the effects of hemochromatosis than women. Other factors that increase risk are:
Ethnic Background: White people of northern European descent (for example, families from England, Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, France, and Scandinavia) have a higher chance of having the HFE gene mutation. Family History: People with a close relative (grandparent, mother, father, sibling, niece, nephew) who has hemochromatosis have a higher chance of having the HFE gene mutation.
There are other factors which influence the rate at which iron is absorbed by the body:
Dietary supplements: Taking iron supplements or multivitamins with iron can speed up the rate at which iron builds up in the body. Persons with hemochromatosis should not take pills containing iron. Eating foods that contain iron is fine. Taking vitamin C supplements may cause the body to absorb more iron. Persons with hemochromatosis should not take pills with more than 500 milligrams of vitamin C per day. Eating foods that contain vitamin C is fine. Blood loss: Losing iron by giving blood and losing iron through menstruation and unrecognized bleeding may slow the start of hemochromatosis. Therefore, men at risk for hemochromatosis usually develop the disease and its symptoms at a younger age than women who are at risk."
2566,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hemochromatosis ?,"If you think you have symptoms like those of hemochromatosis or if you have a close blood relative who has hemochromatosis, you should ask your health care provider to check the amount of iron in your blood."
2567,What to expect if I have Hemochromatosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If the disease is recognized before any organ damage has occurred, one can expect to live a normal, healthy life. If organ damage has occurred, the prognosis depends on how damage the organs are."
2568,What are the symptoms of Hemolytic anemia?,Chills Dark urine Enlarged spleen Fatigue Fever Pale skin color (pallor) Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Yellow skin color (jaundice)
2569,What causes Hemolytic anemia?,"Hemolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow is unable to increase production to make up for the premature destruction of red blood cells. If the bone marrow is able to keep up with the early destruction, anemia does not occur (this is sometimes called compensated hemolysis).
There are many types of hemolytic anemia, which are classified by the reason for the premature destruction of red blood cells. The defect may be in the red blood cell itself (intrinsic factors), or outside the red blood cell (extrinsic factors).
Intrinsic factors are often present at birth (hereditary). They include: Abnormalities in the proteins that build normal red blood cells Differences in the protein inside a red blood cell that carries oxygen (hemoglobin)
Extrinsic factors include: Abnormal immune system responses Blood clots in small blood vessels Certain infections Side effects from medications
Types of hemolytic anemia:
Secondary immune hemolytic anemia Idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia Non-immune hemolytic anemia caused by chemicals or toxins Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) Sickle-cell anemia Hemoglobin SC disease (similar in symptoms to sickle-cell anemia) Thalassemia Hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) Hereditary elliptocytosis Hereditary ovalocytosis Hereditary spherocytosis Malaria Transfusion of blood from a donor with a different blood type"
2570,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hemolytic anemia ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of hemolytic anemia.
2571,What to expect if I have Hemolytic anemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on the type and cause of hemolytic anemia.
2572,What are the symptoms of Hemolytic disease of the newborn?,"Symptoms in a newborn baby may include:
Anemia Edema (swelling under the surface of the skin) Enlarged liver or spleen Hydrops (fluid throughout the body's tissues, including in the spaces containing the lungs, heart, and abdominal organs) Newborn jaundice"
2573,What causes Hemolytic disease of the newborn?,"Erythroblastosis fetalis develops in an unborn infant when the mother and baby have different blood types. The mother produces substances called antibodies that attack the developing baby's red blood cells.
The most common form of erythroblastosis fetalis is ABO incompatibility, which can vary in severity.
The less common form is called Rh incompatibility, which can cause very severe anemia in the baby."
2574,What to expect if I have Hemolytic disease of the newborn  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The severity of this condition can vary widely.
In some instances, the baby has no symptoms of the disease. In other cases, it can lead to death of the baby before or shortly after birth.
It can be treated before birth by intrauterine transfusion."
2575,What are the symptoms of Hemolytic-uremic syndrome?,"HUS often begins with vomiting and diarrhea, which may be bloody. Within a week, the person may become weak and irritable. Persons with this condition may urinate less than normal. Urine output may almost stop.
Red blood cell destruction leads to symptoms of anemia.
Early symptoms:
Blood in the stools Irritability Fever Lethargy Vomiting and diarrhea Weakness
Later symptoms:
Bruising Decreased consciousness Low urine output No urine output Pallor Seizures -- rare Skin rash that looks like fine red spots (petechiae) Yellow skin (jaundice)"
2576,What causes Hemolytic-uremic syndrome?,"Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) often occurs after a gastrointestinal infection with E. coli bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7). However, the condition has also been linked to other gastrointestinal infections, including shigella and salmonella, as well as nongastrointestinal infections."
2577,Who is at highest risk for Hemolytic-uremic syndrome ?,"HUS is most common in children. It is the most common cause of acute kidney failure in children. Several large outbreaks in 1992 and 1993 were linked to undercooked hamburger meat contaminated with E. coli.
Other risk factors for HUS are unknown, although some cases are due to a familial form of the disease. HUS may occur with a variety of other diseases and infections, and after taking certain medications such as mitomycin C or ticlopidine.
HUS is more complicated in adults. It is similar to another disease called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)."
2578,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hemolytic-uremic syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of HUS. Emergency symptoms include:
Blood in the stool No urination Reduced alertness (consciousness)
Call your health care provider if you have had an episode of HUS and your urine output decreases, or you develop other new symptoms."
2579,What to expect if I have Hemolytic-uremic syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"This is a serious illness in both children and adults, and it can cause death. With proper treatment, more than half of patients will recover. The outcome is better in children than adults."
2580,What are the symptoms of Hemophilia?,"The main symptom of hemophilia is bleeding. Mild cases may go unnoticed until later in life, when they occur during surgery or after trauma.
In more severe cases, serious bleeding may occur without any cause. Internal bleeding may occur anywhere. Bleeding into joints is common."
2581,What causes Hemophilia?,"When you bleed, the body launches a series of reactions that help the blood clot. This is called the coagulation cascade. The process involves special proteins called coagulation factors. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is usually a higher chance of bleeding.
Hemophilia is caused by a lack of enough factor VIII or IX. In most cases, hemophilia is passed down through families (inherited). It most often affects males."
2582,What to expect if I have Hemophilia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many people with hemophilia are able to lead pretty normal lives. However, some patients have major bleeding events, most commonly bleeding into the joint spaces.
A small percentage of people with hemophilia may die from severe bleeding."
2583,What are the symptoms of Hemophilia?,"The severity of symptoms vary. Bleeding is the main symptom of the disease and sometimes, although not always, occurs if an infant is circumcised.
Additional bleeding problems are seen when the infant starts crawling and walking.
Mild cases may go unnoticed until later in life when they occur in response to surgery or trauma. Internal bleeding may happen anywhere, and bleeding into joints is common.
Symptoms may include:
Bleeding into joints, with associated pain and swelling Blood in the urine or stool Bruising Gastrointestinal tract and urinary tract hemorrhage Nosebleeds Prolonged bleeding from cuts, tooth extraction, and surgery Spontaneous bleeding"
2584,What causes Hemophilia?,"Hemophilia A is caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the defective gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two copies of the X chromosome, so if the factor VIII/ IX gene on one chromosome doesn't work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor VIII/ IX. Males, however, have only one X chromosome, so if the factor VIII/ IX gene on that chromosome is defective, they will have hemophilia. Thus, most people with hemophilia are male.
If a woman has a defective factor VIII/ IX gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the defective gene can be passed down to her children. In a woman who carries the defective gene, any of her male children will have a 50% chance of having hemophilia A, while any of her female children will have a 50% chance of being a carrier. All female children of men with hemophilia carry the defective gene. Genetic testing is available for concerned parents.
Rarely, adults can develop a bleeding disorder similar to hemophilia. This may happen:
after giving birth (postpartum), in people with certain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, in people with certain types of cancer (most commonly lymphomas and Leukemia (patient information)leukemias), also for unknown reasons (called ""idiopathic"").
Although these situations are rare, they can be associated with serious, even life-threatening bleeding."
2585,Who is at risk for Hemophilia?,"Risk factors for hemophilia A include:
Family history of bleeding Being male"
2586,How to know you have Hemophilia?,"If the patient is the first person in the family to have a suspected bleeding disorder, he or she will undergo a series of tests called a coagulation study. Once a disorder has been identified, other family members will need less testing to diagnose the disorder.
Tests to diagnose hemophilia A include:
Low serum factor VIII/ IX activity Normal prothrombin time (PT) Normal bleeding time (BT) Normal fibrinogen level Prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT)"
2587,What are the symptoms of Hemophilia B?,"The severity of symptoms can vary, and the severe forms become apparent early on.
Bleeding is the main symptom of the disease and sometimes, although not always, occurs if an infant is circumcised. Additional bleeding problems usually show up when the infant becomes mobile.
Mild cases may go unnoticed until later in life, when they occur in response to surgery or trauma. Internal bleeding may occur anywhere and bleeding into joints is common.
Symptoms can include:
Bleeding into joints and associated pain and swelling Blood in the urine or stool Bruising Excessive bleeding following circumcision Gastrointestinal tract and urinary tract hemorrhage Nosebleeds Prolonged bleeding from cuts, tooth extraction, and surgery Spontaneous bleeding"
2588,What causes Hemophilia B?,"Hemophilia B is caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the defective gene located on the X chromosome.
Females have two copies of the X chromosome, so if the factor IX gene on one chromosome is defective, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor IX.
Males, however, have only one X chromosome, so if the factor IX gene on that chromosome is defective, they will have Hemophilia B. Therefore, most people with hemophilia B are male.
If a woman has a defective factor IX gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the defective gene can be passed down to her children.
Boys born to a woman who carries the defective gene have a 50% chance of having hemophilia B, while their daughters have a 50% chance of being a carrier.
All female children of men with hemophilia carry the defective gene."
2589,Who is at highest risk for Hemophilia B ?,"Risk factors for hemophilia B include:
Family history of bleeding Being male"
2590,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hemophilia B ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Symptoms of a bleeding disorder develop A family member has been diagnosed with hemophilia B If you have hemophilia B, and you plan to have children; genetic counseling is available"
2591,What to expect if I have Hemophilia B  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually good with treatment. Most people with hemophilia are able to lead relatively normal lives. A small number of people develop inhibitors of factor IX, and may die from loss of blood.
Patients with hemophilia B should establish regular care with a hematologist, especially one who is associated with a hemophilia treatment center. The ability to have quick and easy access to medical records documenting the patient's history of factor IX levels, factor transfusions (including the type and amount), complications, and amount of any inhibitors can be lifesaving in the event of an emergency situation."
2592,What are the symptoms of Hepatic encephalopathy?,"Symptoms many begin slowly and gradually worsen, or they may begin suddenly and be severe from the start. Symptoms may be mild at first. Family members or caregivers may notice that the patient has:
Breath with a musty or sweet odor Change in sleep patterns Changes in thinking Confusion that is mild Forgetfulness Mental fogginess Personality or mood changes Poor concentration Poor judgment Worsening of handwriting or loss of other small hand movements
More severe symptoms may include:
Abnormal movements or shaking of hands or arms Agitation, excitement, or seizures (occur rarely) Disorientation Drowsiness or confusion Inappropriate behavior or severe personality changes Slurred speech Slowed or sluggish movement
Patients with hepatic encephalopathy can become unconscious, unresponsive, and possibly enter a coma.
Patients with hepatic encephalopathy are often not able to care for themselves because of these symptoms."
2593,What causes Hepatic encephalopathy?,"Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by disorders that affect the liver. These include disorders that reduce liver function (such as cirrhosis or hepatitis) and conditions in which blood circulation does not enter the liver. The exact cause of hepatic encephalopathy is unknown.
An important job of the liver is to change toxic substances that are either made by the body or taken into the body (such as medicines) and make them harmless. However, when the liver is damaged, these ""poisons"" may build up in the bloodstream.
Ammonia, which is produced by the body when proteins are digested, is one of the harmful substances that is normally made harmless by the liver. Many other substances may also build up in the body if the liver is not working well. They can cause damage to the nervous system.
Hepatic encephalopathy may occur suddenly in people who previously had no liver problems when damage occurs to the liver. More often, the condition is seen in people with chronic liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy may be triggered by:
Dehydration Eating too much protein Electrolyte abnormalities (especially a decrease in potassium) from vomiting, or from treatments such as paracentesis or taking diuretics (""water pills"") Bleeding from the intestines, stomach, or esophagus Infections Kidney problems Low oxygen levels in the body Shunt placement or complications (Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) Surgery Use of medications that suppress the central nervous system (such as barbiturates or benzodiazepine tranquilizers)
Disorders that can mimic or mask symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include:
Alcohol intoxication Complicated alcohol withdrawal Meningitis Metabolic abnormalities such as low blood glucose Sedative overdose Subdural hematoma (bleeding under the skull) Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
Hepatic encephalopathy may occur as an acute, potentially reversible disorder. Or it may occur as a chronic, progressive disorder that is associated with chronic liver disease."
2594,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hepatic encephalopathy ?,"Call your health care provider if any change in mental state or other nervous system problem occurs, particularly if there is a known or suspected liver disorder. Hepatic encephalopathy can rapidly get worse and become an emergency condition."
2595,What to expect if I have Hepatic encephalopathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acute hepatic encephalopathy may be treatable. Chronic forms of the disorder often keep getting worse or continue to come back.
Both forms may result in irreversible coma and death. Approximately 80% (8 out of 10 patients) die if they go into a coma. Recovery and the risk of the condition returning vary from patient to patient."
2596,What are the symptoms of Hepatic hemangioma?,"Some hemangiomas may cause bleeding or interfere with organ function, depending on their location. Most cavernous hemangiomas do not produce symptoms. In rare cases, a cavernous hemangioma may rupture."
2597,What causes Hepatic hemangioma?,"A hepatic hemangioma is the most common noncancerous tumor of the liver. It is believed to be a birth defect.
Hepatic hemangiomas can occur at any time, but are most common in people in their 30s - 50s. Women are affected more often than men, and usually have bigger tumors than men.
Babies may develop a type of hepatic hemangioma called benign infantile hemangioendothelioma (also called multinodular hepatic hemangiomatosis). This rare, noncancerous tumor has been linked to high rates of heart failure and death in infants. Infants are usually diagnosed by the time they are 6 months old."
2598,What to expect if I have Hepatic hemangioma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In infants whose tumor is only in one lobe of the liver, surgery is a cure, even if the child has heart failure."
2599,What are the symptoms of Hepatitis ?,"Hepatitis may start and get better quickly (acute hepatitis), or cause long-term disease (chronic hepatitis). In some instances, it may lead to liver damage, liver failure, or even liver cancer. The severity of hepatitis depends on many factors, including the cause of the liver damage and any illnesses you have. Hepatitis A, for example, is usually short-term and does not lead to chronic liver problems. The symptoms of hepatitis include:
Abdominal pain or distention Headache Breast development in males Dark urine and pale or clay-colored stools Fatigue Fever, usually low-grade General itching Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Weight loss
Many people with hepatitis B or C do not have symptoms when they are first infected. They can still develop liver failure later. If you have any risk factors for either type of hepatitis, you should be tested regularly."
2600,What causes Hepatitis ?,"Hepatitis can be caused by:
Immune cells in the body attacking the liver and causing autoimmune hepatitis Infections from viruses (such as hepatitis A, B, or C), bacteria, or parasites Liver damage from alcohol, poisonous mushrooms, or other poisons Medications, such as an overdose of acetaminophen, which can be deadly
Hepatitis is most often caused by one of several viruses, which is why it is often called viral hepatitis. The most common types of viral hepatitis in the United States are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Liver disease can also be caused by inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis, Wilson's disease or hemochromatosis, a condition that involves having too much iron in your body (the excess iron deposits in the liver).
For more information about the causes and risk factors for different types of hepatitis, see also:
Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Hepatitis E Drug-induced hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis"
2601,Who is at highest risk for Hepatitis ?,"Hepatitis can occur in patients of any age group. The risk varies from one type of hepatitis to another.
Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Hepatitis E"
2602,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hepatitis ?,"You should seek your healthcare provider if you experience some of the symptoms described above.
Your doctor will discuss possible treatments with you, depending on the cause of your liver disease."
2603,What to expect if I have Hepatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis varies from one type of hepatitis to another. For more information on Outlook/Prognosis of other types of hepatitis, please see:
Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Hepatitis E"
2604,What are the symptoms of Hepatitis A?,"Hepatitis A virus has an incubation period of about 28 days (anywhere from 15 to 50 is usual). Symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild to severe. Some patients, often young children, have no symptoms, 70% of children younger than 6 who have HAV have no symptoms. Old patients are usually symptomatic. The symptoms of HAV may include:
Fever Malaise Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal pain Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Joint pain Jaundice.
Children younger than 6 years of age typically do not get jaundiced, while more that 70% of older patients do. Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the severity of disease and mortality increase in older age groups.
Symptoms typically last less than 2 months, but 10-15% of patients still have symptoms or have relapses up to 6 months after the onset of the disease. Unlike other instances of hepatitis (such as Hepatitis C), HAV is always acute."
2605,What causes Hepatitis A?,"Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. The hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route; that is when an uninfected person ingests food or water that has been contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water.
People with HAV are infectious from the beginning of the incubation period (about a month before symptoms) until one week after they become jaundiced
Other common ways of acquiring Hepatitis A are:
Direct Person-to-person transmission Eating food made by someone who has HAV who did not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom. Not washing hands after changing a diaper (young children often are asymptomatic). Having anal or oral sex with someone who has HAV. Indirect transmission Eating uncooked food that is HAV -contaminated. Cooked food can also cause hepatitis if not heated to 185°F (85°C) for 1 minute after being contaminated with HAV. Drinking contaminated water. This is a common route of infection in underdeveloped countries. Chlorinated water, such as tap water in developed countries, kills HAV."
2606,Who is at highest risk for Hepatitis A ?,"Anyone who has not been vaccinated or previously infected can contract hepatitis A. In areas where the virus is widespread (high endemicity), most hepatitis A infections occur during early childhood. Risk factors include:
Poor sanitation Lack of safe water Injecting drugs Living in a household with an infected person Being a sexual partner of someone with acute hepatitis A infection Travelling to areas of high endemicity without being immunized."
2607,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hepatitis A ?,"One should report any symptoms and concerns to one's doctor, who can preform a blood test to confirm HAV and help prevent the spreading of the disease to others. An injection is typically offered to anyone living with someone who has HAV. If given within 14 days of contact, the injection can prevent Hepatitis A, or at least make symptoms its milder. There is no cure for Hepatitis A. The best advice to get healthy quicker is to avoid alcohol and get plenty of fluids and rest. One should check with their doctor before taking medicine which may harm the liver. Hepatitis can cause liver failure and death, but this is rare and occurs mostly with people over the age of 50 and have other liver diseases as well."
2608,What to expect if I have Hepatitis A  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"For most patients, HAV will go away on its own after several weeks. Hepatitis A infection can cause the liver to swell, but does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. However, in patients with debilitated immune systems and underlying liver disease, hepatitis A may cause fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality."
2609,What are the symptoms of Hepatitis B?,"Most people do not experience any symptoms during the acute infection phase. After first becoming infected with the hepatitis B virus:
You may have no symptoms You may feel sick for a period of days or weeks You may become very ill (called fulminant hepatitis)
If your body is able to fight off the hepatitis B, any symptoms that you had should go away over a period of weeks to months.
Some people's bodies are not able to completely get rid of the hepatitis B. This is called chronic hepatitis B. Many people who have chronic hepatitis B have few or no symptoms. They may not even look sick. As a result, they may not know they are infected. However, they can still spread the virus to other people. Symptoms may not appear for up to 6 months after the time of infection. Early symptoms may include:
Appetite loss Abdominal pain Extreme fatigue Fever, low-grade Muscle and joint pain Nausea and vomiting Dark urine Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
People with chronic hepatitis may have no symptoms, even though gradual liver damage may be occurring. Over time, some people may develop symptoms of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.
More than 90% of healthy adults who are infected with the hepatitis B virus will recover and be completely rid of the virus within 6 months."
2610,What causes Hepatitis B?,"Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).
In highly endemic areas, HBV is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth, or from person to person in early childhood.
Perinatal or early childhood transmission may also account for more than one third of chronic infections in areas of low endemicity, although in those settings, sexual transmission and the use of contaminated needles, especially among injecting drug users, are the major routes of infection.
The hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. The incubation period of the hepatitis B virus is 75 days on average, but can vary from 30 to 180 days. The virus may be detected 30 to 60 days after infection and persists for variable periods of time.
Hepatitis B infection can be spread through having contact with the blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and other body fluids of someone who already has a hepatitis B infection.
Ways of infection include:
Blood transfusions (not common in the United States) Direct contact with blood in health care settings Sexual contact with an infected person Tattoo or acupuncture with unclean needles or instruments Shared needles during drug use Shared personal items (such as toothbrushes, razors, and nail clippers) with an infected person
The hepatitis B virus is not spread by contaminated food or water, and cannot be spread casually in the workplace."
2611,Who is at highest risk for Hepatitis B ?,"The likelihood that infection with the hepatitis B virus becomes chronic depends upon the age at which a person becomes infected. Children less than 6 years of age who become infected with the hepatitis B virus are the most likely to develop chronic infections:
80–90% of infants infected during the first year of life develop chronic infections 30–50%% of children infected before the age of 6 years develop chronic infections
In adults:
<5% of otherwise healthy adults who are infected will develop chronic infection 15–25% of adults who become chronically infected during childhood die from hepatitis B-related liver cancer or cirrhosis
Risk factors for hepatitis B infection include:
Being born, or having parents who were born in regions with high infection rates (including Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean) Being infected with HIV Being on hemodialysis Having multiple sex partners Men having sex with men
Most of the damage from the hepatitis B virus occurs because of the way the body responds to the infection. When the body's immune system detects the infection, it sends out special cells to fight it off. However, these disease-fighting cells can lead to liver inflammation."
2612,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hepatitis B ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of hepatitis B Hepatitis B symptoms do not go away in 2 or 3 weeks, or new symptoms develop You belong to a high-risk group for hepatitis B and have not yet received the Hepatitis B vaccine."
2613,What to expect if I have Hepatitis B  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The acute illness usually goes away after 2 - 3 weeks. The liver usually returns to normal within 4 - 6 months in almost all patients who are infected. Some people develop chronic hepatitis.
Almost all newborns and about 50% of children who become infected with hepatitis B develop chronic hepatitis. Less than 5% of adults who are infected with the hepatitis B virus develop the chronic condition. Chronic hepatitis B infection increases the risk for liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. People who have chronic hepatitis B can transmit the infection. They are considered carriers of the disease, even if they do not have any symptoms.
Liver cancer is almost always fatal and often develops in people at an age when they are most productive and have family responsibilities.
In developing countries, most people with liver cancer die within months of diagnosis. In high-income countries, surgery and chemotherapy can prolong life for up to a few years."
2614,What are the symptoms of Hepatocellular adenoma?,"Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom in some patients, and the pain is usually related to tumoral hemorrhage. Right upper quadrant abdominal fullness or discomfort is present in 40% of cases due to mass effect. Eventually, spontaneous rupture or hemorrhage may occur, leading to acute abdominal pain with progression to hypotension and even death. Patients with hepatocellular adenomas typically have a history of oral contraceptive use (females) and long term anabolic steroids use (males)."
2615,What causes Hepatocellular adenoma?,"The causes of hepatocellular adenoma include; Oral contraceptive medications The causal relationship is proportional to the hormonal dose and duration of medication, highest in women over 30 years of age and after 24 months of using oral contraceptives. Pregnancy It appears to stimulate rapid growth in these lesions with the risk of potentially fatal spontaneous rupture. Glycogen storage disease types I, II and IV Long term use of anabolic androgenic steroids Metabolic syndrome Maturity onset diabetes of young (MODY) Obesity Clomiphene Familial adenomatous polyposis Vascular disorders such as portal vein agenesis, Budd-Chiari syndrome and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia."
2616,Who is at highest risk for Hepatocellular adenoma ?,"The most important risk factor in the development of hepatocellular adenoma is use of oral contraceptive medications.
Drospirenone and Ethinyl estradiol Norethindrone acetate and Ethinyl estradiol Norgestimate and Ethinyl estradiol Norgestrel and Ethinyl estradiol The risk is proportional to: Hormonal dose Duration of medication
Other risk factors include: 
Clomiphene Methyltestosterone Danazol Klinefelter's syndrome Glycogen storage diseases I, II and IV. Familial adenomatous polyposis"
2617,What to expect if I have Hepatocellular adenoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis is usually good for hepatocellular adenoma. When diagnosed, the discontinuation of oral contraception or androgen intake leads to regression of hepatocellular adenoma. In cases that do not regress after the withdrawal of oral contraception or androgen, surgical treatment is the management of choice."
2618,What are the symptoms of Hereditary elliptocytosis?,Fatigue Shortness of breath Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice): may persist for a long time in a newborn
2619,What causes Hereditary elliptocytosis?,"Elliptocytosis affects about 1 in every 2,500 people of northern European heritage. It is more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent."
2620,Who is at highest risk for Hereditary elliptocytosis ?,You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your family has had it.
2621,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hereditary elliptocytosis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have jaundice that doesn't go away or symptoms of anemia or gallstones.
2622,What to expect if I have Hereditary elliptocytosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most persons with hereditary elliptocytosis have no problems, and are unaware of their condition."
2623,What are the symptoms of Hereditary spherocytosis?,"Infants may have yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and pale coloring (pallor).
Other symptoms may include:
Fatigue Irritability Shortness of breath Weakness"
2624,What causes Hereditary spherocytosis?,"This disorder is caused by a defective gene. The defect results in an abnormal red blood cell membrane. The affected cells have a smaller surface area for their volume than normal red blood cells, and can break open easily.
The anemia can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases the disorder may be found in early childhood. In mild cases it may go unnoticed until adulthood."
2625,Who is at highest risk for Hereditary spherocytosis ?,"Having a family history of spherocytosis increases the risk for this disorder.
This disorder is most common in people of northern European descent, but it has been found in all races."
2626,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hereditary spherocytosis ?,"Call your health care provider for an appointment if your symptoms get worse, do not improve with treatment, or if you develop new symptoms."
2627,What to expect if I have Hereditary spherocytosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"This outcome is usually good with treatment. After the spleen is removed, the life span of the red blood cell returns to normal."
2628,What are the symptoms of Hernia?,"Most often there are no symptoms. However, sometimes there may be discomfort or pain. The discomfort may be worse when you stand, strain, or lift heavy objects.
Although a hernia may only cause mild discomfort, it may get bigger and strangulate. This means that the tissue is stuck inside the hole and its blood supply has been cut off. If this occurs, you will need urgent surgery."
2629,What causes Hernia?,"Usually, there is no obvious cause of a hernia. Sometimes hernias occur with heavy lifting. Hernias may be present at birth, but the bulging may not be noticeable until later in life. Some patients may have a family history of hernias.
Hernias can be seen in infants and children. This can happen when the lining around the abdominal organs does not close properly before birth. About 5 out of 100 children have inguinal hernias (more boys than girls). Some children may not have symptoms until they are adults.
Any activity or medical problem that increases pressure on the abdominal wall tissue and muscles may lead to a hernia, including:
Chronic constipation, straining to have bowel movements. Chronic cough. Cystic fibrosis. Enlarged prostate, straining to urinate. Extra weight. Heavy lifting. Poor nutrition. Smoking. Overexertion. Undescended testicles."
2630,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hernia ?,"Call your doctor right away if:
You have a painful hernia and the contents cannot be pushed back into the abdomen using gentle pressure. You develop nausea, vomiting, or a fever along with a painful hernia. You have a hernia that becomes red, purple, dark, or discolored. You have groin pain, swelling, or a bulge. You have a bulge or swelling in the groin or belly button, or that is associated with a previous surgical cut."
2631,What to expect if I have Hernia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome is usually good with treatment. Recurrence is rare (1-3%).
2632,What are the symptoms of Hiatus hernia?,"In most patients, hiatus hernias cause no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they usually experience the symptoms like those of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or its complications.
Heartburn and regurgitation, when stomach acid refluxes back into the esophagus. Chronic reflux of acid into the esophagus may cause injury and bleeding. Anemia Difficulty swallowing Chronic cough, wheezing, and even pneumonia: These symptoms in respiratory system are caused because stomach secretions can seep up the esophagus and into the lungs while sleeping.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2633,Who is at risk for hiatus hernia?,"Old people: Muscle weakening and loss of elasticity as people age. Pregnacy: Intra-abdominal forces exerted in pregnancy. Persistent and intense pressure on the surrounding muscles, such as when coughing, vomiting, or straining during a bowel movement or while lifting heavy objects Chronic constipation Western, fiber-depleted diet Obesity Chronic esophagitis Abdominal ascites"
2634,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hiatus hernia ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of hiatus hernia develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Bleeding in your upper digestive tract Severe abdominal pain or chest pain"
2635,What to expect if I have Hiatus hernia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most patients with hiatus hernias can be treated well. The prognosis of hiatus hernia depends on the complications.
2636,What are the symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease?,Constipation Failure to pass a first stool within 24-48 hours after birth Malabsorption Poor weight gain Slow growth (child 0-5 years) Swollen belly Vomiting Watery diarrhea (in the newborn)
2637,What are the causes of Hirschsprung's disease?,"Muscle contractions in the gut help digested materials move through the intestine. This is called peristalsis. Trigger of the contractions are nerves among the muscle layers.
In Hirschsprung's disease, the nerves are missing from a short or long part of the bowel. Areas without such nerves can not push material through. This causes a blockage. Intestinal contents build up behind the blockage, causing the bowel and abdomen to become swollen. If the condition is severe, the newborn may fail to pass meconium or stool, and the newborn may vomit.
Milder cases may not be diagnosed until later ages. In older children, the disease may cause chronic constipation, abdominal swelling, and decreased growth.
Hirschsprung's disease causes about 25% of all newborn intestinal obstructions. It occurs five times more frequently in males than in females. Hirschsprung's disease is sometimes associated with other inherited or congenital conditions such as Down syndrome."
2638,Who is at risk for Hirschsprung's disease?,"Risk Factors include:
Gender (i.e., higher risk in males than females) Congenital condition (e.g., Down Syndrome)."
2639,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hirschsprung%27s disease ?,"Call your child's health care provider if symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease developed.
Call your child's health care provider if your child has abdominal pain or other new symptoms, after being treated for this condition."
2640,What to expect if I have Hirschsprung%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Symptoms became improved or eliminated in most children after surgical treatment. A better outcome is associated with early treatment and shorter bowel segment involvement.
2641,What are the symptoms of Histrionic personality disorder?,"People with this disorder are usually able to function at a high level and can be successful socially and at work.
Symptoms include:
Acting or looking overly seductive Being easily influenced by other people Being overly concerned with their looks Being overly dramatic and emotional Being overly sensitive to criticism or disapproval Believing that relationships are more intimate than they actually are Blaming failure or disappointment on others Constantly seeking reassurance or approval Having a low tolerance for frustration or delayed gratification Needing to be the center of attention (self-centeredness) Quickly changing emotions, which may seem shallow to others"
2642,What causes Histrionic personality disorder?,"The cause of this disorder is unknown. Both genes and early childhood events are thought to contribute.
It occurs more often in women than in men, although it may be diagnosed more often in women because attention-seeking and sexual forwardness are less socially acceptable for women.
Histrionic personality disorder usually begins in early adulthood."
2643,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Histrionic personality disorder ?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Histrionic personality disorder
2644,What to expect if I have Histrionic personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Histrionic personality disorder can improve with psychotherapy and sometimes medications. If left untreated, it can cause conflict in people's personal life and prevent them from reaching their potential in their work life."
2645,What are the symptoms of AIDS?,"The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of infections that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy immune systems. These are called opportunistic infections. People with AIDS have had their immune system weakened by HIV and are very susceptible to these opportunistic infections. Some people with HIV infection remain without symptoms for years between the time the are exposed to the virus and when they develop AIDS. Initial infections can present sometimes with Flu like symptoms.
Fevers
Sweats (particularly at night),
Swollen glands, chills, weakness
Weight loss
Sore throat
Diarrhea
Mouth sores including yeast infections."
2646,What causes AIDS?,"Anyone can get HIV. The most important thing to know is how you can get the virus. You can get HIV:
By having unprotected sex- sex without a condom- with someone who has HIV. The virus can be in an infected person’s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions and can enter your body through tiny cuts or sores in your skin, or in the lining of your vagina, penis, rectum, or mouth. By sharing a needle and syringe to inject drugs or sharing drug equipment used to prepare drugs for injection with someone who has HIV. From a blood transfusion or blood clotting factor that you got before 1985. (But today it is unlikely you could get infected that way because all blood in the United States has been tested for HIV since 1985.) Babies born to women with HIV also can become infected during pregnancy, birth, or breast-feeding.
You cannot get HIV:
By working with or being around someone who has HIV. From sweat, spit, tears, clothes, drinking fountains, phones, toilet seats, or through everyday things like sharing a meal. From insect bites or stings. From donating blood. From a closed-mouth kiss (but there is a very small chance of getting it from open-mouthed or ""French"" kissing with an infected person because of possible blood contact)."
2647,Who is at highest risk for HIV AIDS ?,"Persons who are practicing unsafe sexual behavior(unprotected), drug addicts. Sexual partners of those who engage in high risk behavior like anal sex and share needle for drug use. Children born to HIV positive mothers are at increased risks for developing the disease People who received blood transfusion or clotting products between 1977 to 1985 as screening for HIV was not s standard test at that time"
2648,When to seek urgent medical care when I have HIV AIDS ?,"Since HIV weakens the immune system, people with AIDS should consult a doctor and get tested if they believe they have it. If you are diagnosed with AIDS, you should be in constant contact with your doctor. People with AIDS are susceptible to infections and cancers that most healthy adults would not get and so they must be very aware of any new diseases which their bodies acquire, and report them to their physicians as they occur."
2649,What to expect if I have HIV AIDS  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Right now, there is no cure for AIDS. It is always fatal if no treatment is provided. In the US, most patients survive many years after diagnosis because of the availability of medicines such as HAART. HAART and medicines like it have dramatically increased the amount of time people with HIV remain alive.
Research continues in the areas of drug treatments and vaccine development. Unfortunately, HIV medications are not always available in the developing world, where the bulk of cases now occur."
2650,What are the symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"Fatigue Fever and chills that come and go Itching all over the body that cannot be explained Loss of appetite Soaking night sweats Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin (swollen glands) Weight loss that cannot be explained
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Coughing, chest pains, or breathing problems if there are swollen lymph nodes in the chest Excessive sweating Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs due to swollen spleen or liver Pain in lymph nodes after drinking alcohol Skin blushing or flushing
Note: Symptoms caused by Hodgkin's lymphoma may also occur also with other conditions. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific symptoms."
2651,Who is at highest risk for Hodgkin%27s lymphoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma is related to several factors.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection/Mononucleosis: The role of EBV in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma is not very clear. As we know, mononucleosis is an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Clinical data show that mononuclesis has a close relationship with Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Family history: The reason why family history may increase risk of developing Hodgkin's lymphoma is not clear. Some researchers proclaimed they had found certain changes in the genes responsible for immunity in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Socioeconomic status: Clinical survey shows patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma posses higher socioeconomic background. The reason is not clear.
Geography: Epidemiological data demonstrates that Hodgkin's lymphoma is most common in western countries such as the United States, Canada and northern Europe, and is least common in Asian countries.
Age: Epidemiological survey suggests that Hodgkin's lymphoma is most common in early adulthood (ages 15 to 40, especially in a person's 20s) and in late adulthood (after age 55).
Gender: Hodgkin's lymphoma occurs slightly more often in men than in women."
2652,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hodgkin%27s lymphoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Hyperpyrexia and severe chills Severe infection"
2653,What to expect if I have Hodgkin%27s lymphoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hodgkin's disease is considered one of the most curable forms of cancer, especially if it is diagnosed and treated early. Unlike other cancers, Hodgkin's disease is often very curable, even in its late stages.
With the right treatment, more than 90% of people with stage I or II Hodgkin's lymphoma survive for at least 10 years. If the disease has spread, the treatment may be more intense. However, 90% of people with advanced disease survive for at least 5 years.
Patients who survive 15 years after treatment are more likely to later die from other causes, including complications of the treatment, rather than from Hodgkin's disease.
People with Hodgkin's lymphoma whose disease returns within a year after treatment or who do not respond to the first treatment have a poorer outlook.
You will need to have regular exams and imaging tests for years after your treatment. This helps your doctor check for signs of the cancer returning, and for any long-term treatment effects."
2654,What are the symptoms of Homocystinuria?,"Newborn infants appear healthy. Early symptoms, if present at all, are not obvious.
Symptoms may occur as mildly delayed development or failure to thrive. Increasing visual problems may lead to diagnosis of this condition.
Other symptoms include:
Chest deformities (pectus carinatum, pectus excavatum) Flush across the cheeks High arches of the feet Knock knees Long limbs Mental retardation Nearsightedness Psychiatric disorders Spidery fingers (arachnodactyly) Tall, thin build"
2655,What causes Homocystinuria?,"Homocystinuria is inherited in families as an autosomal recessive trait. This means that the child must inherit the non-working gene from both parents to be seriously affected.
Homocystinuria has several features in common with Marfan syndrome. Unlike Marfan syndrome, in which the joints tend to be ""loose,"" in homocystinuria the joints tend to be ""tight."""
2656,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Homocystinuria ?,"Call your health care provider if you or a family member shows symptoms of this disorder, particularly if there is a family history of homocystinuria. Also call if you have a family history and are planning to have children."
2657,What to expect if I have Homocystinuria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B6 therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.
If the diagnosis is made while a patient is young, starting a low methionine diet quickly can prevent some mental retardation and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.
Patients with persistent rises in blood homocysteine levels are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause significant medical problems and shorten lifespan."
2658,What are the symptoms of Hospital-acquired pneumonia?,"In an elderly person, the first sign of hospital-acquired pneumonia may be mental changes or confusion. Other symptoms are:
A cough that may produce mucus -like, greenish, or pus-like phlegm (sputum)
Fever and chills
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Sharp chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing or coughing
Shortness of breath"
2659,What causes Hospital-acquired pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is a common illness. It is caused by many different germs. Hospital-acquired pneumonia tends to be more serious than other lung infections because:
Patients in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs.
The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous than those encountered in the community.
Hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs more often in patients who are using a respirator machine to help them breathe. This machine is also called a ventilator. This type of pneumonia is known as ventilator-associated pneumonia.Hospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands or clothes from one patient to another. That is why hand-washing, wearing gowns, and using other safety measures is so important in the hospital.
Patients who are more prone to getting hospital-acquired pneumonia:
Are alcoholic
Have had chest surgery or other major surgery
Have a weak immune system from cancer treatment, certain medicines, or severe wounds
Have long-term (chronic) lung disease
Breathe saliva or food into their lungs as a result of not being fully alert or problems swallowing
Are older"
2660,What to expect if I have Hospital-acquired pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be a life-threatening illness. Long-term lung damage may occur.
2661,What are the symptoms of Human respiratory syncytial virus?,"Symptoms vary and differ with age. They usually appear 4 - 6 days after coming in contact with the virus. Older children usually have only mild, cold-like symptoms, such as cough, stuffy nose, or low-grade fever. Infants under age 1 may have more severe symptoms and often have the most trouble breathing. In general, RSV symptoms include:
Bluish skin color due to a lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Breathing difficulty or labored breathing Cough Croupy cough (often described as a ""seal bark"" cough) Fever Nasal flaring Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Shortness of breath Stuffy nose Wheezing"
2662,What causes Human respiratory syncytial virus?,"RSV is the most common germ that causes lung and airway infections in infants and young children. Most infants have had this infection by age 2. Outbreaks of RSV infections most often begin in the fall and run into the spring. The infection can occur in people of all ages. The virus spreads through tiny droplets that go into the air when a sick person blows their nose, coughs, or sneezes. You can catch RSV if:
A person with RSV sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you You touch, kiss, or shake hands with someone who is infected by the virus You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contamined by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.
RSV often spreads very rapidly in crowded households and day care centers. The virus can live for a half an hour or more on hands. The virus can also live for up to 5 hours on countertops and for several hours on used tissues."
2663,Who is at highest risk for Human respiratory syncytial virus ?,"The following increase the risk for RSV:
Attending day care Being near tobacco smoke Having school-aged brothers or sisters Living in crowded conditions"
2664,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Human respiratory syncytial virus ?,Refer to a health professional in case you think you are developing symptoms of the illness.
2665,What to expect if I have Human respiratory syncytial virus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Rarely, RSV infection can cause death in infants. However, this is unlikely if the child is seen by a health care provider in the early stages of the disease. More severe RSV disease may occur in the following infants:
Premature infants Infants with chronic lung disease Infants whose immune system does not work well Infants with certain forms of heart disease"
2666,What are the symptoms of Huntington's disease?,"Behavior changes may occur before movement problems, and can include:
Antisocial behaviors Hallucinations Irritability Moodiness Restlessness or fidgeting Paranoia Psychosis
Abnormal and unusual movements include:
Head turning to shift eye position Facial movements, including grimaces Slow, uncontrolled movements Quick, sudden, sometimes wild jerking movements of the arms, legs, face, and other body parts Unsteady gait
Dementia that slowly gets worse, including:
Loss of memory Loss of judgment Speech changes Personality changes Disorientation or confusion
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease:
Anxiety, stress, and tension Difficulty swallowing Speech impairment
Symptoms in children:
Rigidity Slow movements Tremor"
2667,What causes Huntington's disease?,"American doctor George Huntington first described the disorder in 1872.
Huntington's disease is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome #4. The defect causes a part of DNA, called a CAG repeat, to occur many more times than it is supposed to. Normally, this section of DNA is repeated 10 to 35 times. But in persons with Huntington's disease, it is repeated 36 to 120 times.
As the gene is passed on from one generation to the next, the number of repeats called a CAG repeat expansion tend to get larger. The larger the number of repeats, the greater your chance of developing symptoms at an earlier age. Therefore, as the disease is passed along in families, it becomes evident at younger and younger ages.
There are two forms of Huntington's disease. The most common is adult-onset Huntington's disease. Persons with this form usually develop symptoms in their mid 30s and 40s.
An early-onset form of Huntington's disease accounts for a small number of cases and begins in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms may resemble those of Parkinson's disease with rigidity, slow movements, and tremor.
If one of your parents has Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of getting the gene for the disease. If you get the gene from your parents, you will develop the disease at some point in your life, and can pass it onto your children. If you do not get the gene from your parents, you cannot pass the gene onto your children."
2668,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Huntington%27s disease ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.
2669,What to expect if I have Huntington%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Huntington's disease causes disability that gets worse over time.
Persons with this disease usually die within 15 to 20 years. The cause of death is often infection, although suicide is also common.
It is important to realize that the disease affects everyone differently. The number of CAG repeats may determine the severity of symptoms. Persons with few repeats may have mild abnormal movements later in life and slow disease progression, while those with a large number of repeats may be severely affected at a young age."
2670,What are the symptoms of Hydatidiform mole?,"Abnormal growth of the womb (uterus):
Excessive growth in about half of cases Smaller-than-expected growth in about a third of cases
Nausea and vomiting that may be severe enough to require a hospital stay Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy during the first 3 months of pregnancy Symptoms of hyperthyroidism:
Heat intolerance Loose stools Rapid heart rate Restlessness, nervousness Skin warmer and more moist than usual Trembling hands Unexplained weight loss
Symptoms similar to preeclampsia that occur in the 1st trimester or early 2nd trimester. This is almost always a sign of a hydatidiform mole, because preeclampsia is extremely rare this early in a normal pregnancy
High blood pressure Swelling in feet, ankles, legs"
2671,What to expect if I have Hydatidiform mole  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"More than 80% of hydatidiform moles are benign (noncancerous). The outcome after treatment is usually excellent.
Close follow-up is essential. After treatment, you should use very effective contraception for at least 6 to 12 months to avoid pregnancy.
In some cases, hydatidiform moles may develop into invasive moles. These moles may grow so far into the uterine wall and cause bleeding or other complications.
In a few cases, a hydatidiform mole may develop into a choriocarcinoma, a fast-growing cancerous form of gestational trophoblastic disease."
2672,What are the symptoms of Hydrocele?,"The main symptom is a painless, swollen testicle, which feels like a water balloon. A hydrocele may occur on one or both sides."
2673,What causes Hydrocele?,"Hydroceles are common in newborn infants. During normal development, the testicles descend down a tube from the abdomen into the scrotum. Hydroceles result when this tube fails to close. Fluid drains from the abdomen through the open tube. The fluid builds up in the scrotum, where it becomes trapped. This causes the scrotum to become swollen. Hydroceles normally go away a few months after birth, but their appearance may worry new parents. Occasionally, a hydrocele may be associated with an inguinal hernia. Hydroceles may also be caused by inflammation or injury of the testicle or epididymis, or by fluid or blood blockage within the spermatic cord. This type of hydrocele is more common in older men."
2674,Who is at highest risk for Hydrocele ?,"Most hydroceles are present at birth (congenital). Otherwise, the condition generally affects men older than 40. The risk factors are:
Scrotal injury Infection, including sexually transmitted diseases Radiation therapy"
2675,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hydrocele ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of hydrocele (to rule out other causes of a testicle lump).
Acute pain in the scrotum or testicles is a surgical emergency. If enlargement of the scrotum is associated with acute pain, seek medical attention immediately."
2676,What to expect if I have Hydrocele  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Generally, a simple hydrocele goes away without surgery. If surgery is necessary, it is a simple procedure for a skilled surgeon, and usually has an excellent outcome."
2677,What are the symptoms of Hydrocephalus?,"Symptoms of Hydrocephalus can vary from person to person and usually depend on age, severity, and cause.
Infants:
Bulging soft spot (fontanelle) Larger than normal head size Seizures Vomiting Constant tiredness Irritability Gaps between skull bones Eyes that are constantly looking down
Older children:
Headache Irritability Tantrums Constant tiredness Shrill cries Changes in ability to think or act Personality changes Uncontrollable eye movements Changes in eye shape Double vision Changes in appearance of facial features or shape Trouble coordinating motor movements Difficulty walking Slowed growth Trouble eating Muscle spasms Loss of bladder control Nausea"
2678,What are the causes of Hydrocephalus?,"There is a layer of fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain and spinal cord and creates a cushion between the brain and the skull. Normally the CSF flows in and around the brain providing nutrients and oxygen before getting reabsorbed by the bloodstream but, when something goes wrong the CSF may begin to build up and put pressure on the brain.
Many times the cause of hydrocephalus remains unknown. But some of the known causes include the following:
Causes of CSF blockage include:
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) Tumors Genetic defects In-utero infections Bleeding in the brain in premature infants Meningitis Other infections contracted after birth"
2679,Who is at highest risk for Hydrocephalus ?,Premature babies are often at higher risk.
2680,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hydrocephalus ?,Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY if you suspect hydrocephalus or see any of the signs or symptoms listed above. Hydrocephalus is a severe condition that could result in death if left untreated
2681,What to expect if I have Hydrocephalus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis is poor if Hydrocephalus is left untreated and usually results in death. Prognosis is also poor for individuals with brain tumors or severe infections.
Even individuals that recover from Hydrocephalus may face permanent brain damage that can lead to both physical and mental disabilities."
2682,What are the symptoms of Hydrops fetalis?,"Symptoms depend on the severity of the condition.
Mild forms may cause:
Liver swelling Change in skin color (pallor)
More severe forms may cause:
Breathing problems Bruising or purplish bruise-like spots on the skin Heart failure Severe anemia Severe jaundice Total body swelling"
2683,What causes Hydrops fetalis?,"There are two types of hydrops fetalis: Immune and nonimmune. The exact cause depends on which form a baby has.
Immune hydrops fetalis is a complication of a severe form of Rh incompatibility. Rh compatibility causes massive red blood cell destruction, which leads to several problems, including total body swelling. Severe swelling can interfere with how the body organs work.
Nonimmune hydrops fetalis occurs when a disease or medical condition disrupts the body's ability to manage fluid.
There are three main causes for this type: heart or lung problems, severe anemia (thalassemia), and genetic defects, including Turner syndrome. The number of babies who develop immune hydrops fetalis has dramatically decreased since the introduction of the medicine RhoGAM, which is used to treat pregnant mothers at risk for Rh incompatibility."
2684,What to expect if I have Hydrops fetalis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Hydrops fetalis often results in death of the infant shortly before or after delivery.
The risk is highest among the most premature babies and those who are severely ill at birth."
2685,What are the symptoms of Hymenolepis infection?,"Symptoms occur only with heavy infections. Symptoms include:
Diarrhea Gastrointestinal discomfort Itchy anus Poor appetite Weakness"
2686,What causes Hymenolepis infection?,"Hymenolepis live in warm climates and are common in the southern United States. Insects eat the eggs of these worms.
Humans and other animals become infected when they intentionally or unintentionally eat material contaminated by insects. In an infected person, it is possible for the worm's entire life cycle to be completed in the bowel, so infection can last for years.
Hymenolepis nana infections are much more common than Hymenolepis diminuta infections in humans."
2687,Who is at highest risk for Hymenolepis infection ?,"Hymenolepis infections used to be common in the southeastern United States, in crowded environments and in people who were confined to institutions. However, the disease occurs throughout the world."
2688,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hymenolepis infection ?,Call your health care provider if chronic diarrhea or abdominal cramping are present.
2689,What to expect if I have Hymenolepis infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Expect full recovery following treatment.
2690,What are the symptoms of Hyperemesis gravidarum?,"Severe, persistent nausea during pregnancy, often leads to weight loss Lightheadedness or fainting"
2691,What causes Hyperemesis gravidarum?,"Nearly all women have some nausea or vomiting, or morning sickness, particularly during the first 3 months of pregnancy.
The cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is believed to be rapidly rising blood levels of a hormone called HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), which is released by the placenta.
Extreme nausea and vomiting during pregnancy can happen if you are pregnant with twins (or more) or if you have a hydatidiform mole."
2692,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperemesis gravidarum ?,Call your health care provider if you are pregnant and have severe nausea and vomiting.
2693,What to expect if I have Hyperemesis gravidarum  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Nausea and vomiting usually peaks between 2 and 12 weeks of pregnancy and goes away by the second half of pregnancy.
With proper identification of symptoms and careful follow-up, this condition rarely presents serious complications for the infant or mother."
2694,What are the symptoms of hyperinsulinism?,"Insulin may decrease your blood sugar. Patients with hyperinsulinism may show symptoms as following:
Hunger Sweating Weakness Palpitations Diplopia, blurred vision Headache, dizziness Emotional instability, anxiety Confusion, stupor, even seizures, or coma and death.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2695,Who is at highest risk for Hyperinsulinism ?,"Pancreatic insulinoma: An insulinoma is a tumor in the pancreas which is an organ in the abdomen that can make insulin to regulate blood sugar level. Patients with insulinoma can produce too much insulin and may show a series of symptoms of hypoglycemia. Side effect of inappropriate treatment for diabetes: When receiving overdose of insulin or diabetes medicine, or not eating enough food with ordinary dosage, or suddenly increasing your exercise without increasing the amount of food you eat, patients with diabetes may appear symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients are misdiagnosed with diabetes and given insulin when it is not needed. Obesity and consumption of a diet rich in carbohydrates are risk factors for this disease."
2696,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperinsulinism ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of hyperinsulinism develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Confusion Stupor Seizures Coma"
2697,What to expect if I have Hyperinsulinism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis of hyperinsulin depends on the cause of the disease. Outcomes from benign insulinoma may be better than cancerous insulinoma. But sometimes hopoglycemia may be fatal.
2698,What are the symptoms of Hyperopia?,"Aching eyes Blurred vision of close objects Crossed eyes (strabismus) in some children Eye strain Headache while reading
Mild farsightedness may not cause any problems except for a need for reading glasses."
2699,What causes Hyperopia?,"Farsightedness is the result of the visual image being focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. It may be caused by the eyeball being too small or the focusing power being too weak.
Farsightedness is often present from birth, but children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps make up for the problem. As aging occurs, glasses or contact lenses may be required to correct the vision. If you have family members who are farsighted, you are also more likely to become farsighted."
2700,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperopia ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider or ophthalmologist if symptoms of farsightedness develop and you have not had an eye examination recently.
Also, call if vision begins to get worse after you have been diagnosed with farsightedness.
If you have been diagnosed with farsightedness or suspect you may have farsightedness and you suddenly develop severe eye pain, eye redness, or decreased vision you should see your eye doctor immediately."
2701,What to expect if I have Hyperopia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome is expected to be good.
2702,What are the symptoms of Hyperparathyroidism?,Back pain Blurred vision (because of cataracts) Bone pain or tenderness Decreased height Depression Fatigue Fractures of long bones Increased urine output Increased thirst Itchy skin Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea Muscle weakness and pain Personality changes Stupor and possibly coma Upper abdominal pain
2703,What causes Hyperparathyroidism?,"The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone, which controls calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.
When calcium levels are too low, the body responds by increasing production of parathyroid hormone. This increase in parathyroid hormone causes more calcium to be taken from the bone and more calcium to be reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney. When the calcium level returns to normal, parathyroid hormone production slows down.
There are two main types of hyperparathyroidism.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands. This leads to too much parathyroid hormone, which raises the level of calcium in the blood. The term ""hyperparathyroidism"" generally refers to primary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is when the body produces extra parathyroid hormone because the calcium levels are too low. This is seen when vitamin D levels are low or when calcium is not absorbed from the intestines. Correcting the calcium level and the underlying problem will bring the parathyroid levels in the normal range.
If the parathyroid glands continue to produce too much parathyroid hormone even though the calcium level is back to normal, the condition is called ""tertiary hyperthyroidism."" It occurs especially in patients with kidney problems"
2704,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperparathyroidism ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.
2705,What to expect if I have Hyperparathyroidism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outlook depends on the specific type of hyperparathyroidism.
2706,What are the symptoms of hyperpituitarism?,"Signs and symptoms of hyperpituitarism are the excessive production of growth hormone and abnormal hormone excretion controlled by the pituitary, such as prolactin and thyroid hormones.
Gigantism in children. Abnormal growth of hands and feet in adults Headache Visual field loss or double vision Excessive sweating Hoarseness Galactorrhea Sleep apnea Carpal Tunnel syndrome Joint pain and limitation of motion Muscle weakness Numbness or tingling of skin Osteoporosis, kyphosis Hypertension, arteriosclerosis, even heart failure"
2707,Who is at highest risk for Hyperpituitarism ?,Pituitary tumor Carcinoid tumors
2708,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperpituitarism ?,"If you develop signs and symptoms associated with hyperpituitarism, see your doctor to determine the cause. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Palpitation Chest pain Severe hypertension"
2709,What to expect if I have Hyperpituitarism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of hyperpituitariam depends on the hormone level affected.
Whether the patient has been treated with surgery to remove the tumor. For hyperprolactinemia: The undetectable level (<2 µg/L) of prolactin predicts cure with more than 90% probability. On the contrary, higher values within the reference range indicate incomplete removal of the adenoma. Postoperative serum GH levels: Basal serum GH levels obtained immediately after surgery suggest the outcome of tumor recurrence in children with GH-releasing adenomas. The higher the GH levels are, the worse of the prognosis will be. For hyperpituitariam resulting from corticotropinoma: The concentration of plasma cortisol concentration in the morning and corticotropin concentration over 24 consecutive hours measured 4-7 days after surgery may demonstrate the prognosis. The lower the concentrations are, the better outcomes will be.
Template:WH Template:WS"
2710,What are the symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia?,"Signs and symptoms result from abnormal secretion of prolactin and the pressure of the tumor in or around the pituitary gland. Usual signs and symptoms include:
Headache Vision loss Sexual dysfunction: In men, patients may show signs of decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. In women, usual symptoms include decreases in menstruation or amenorrhea, galactorrhea) without pregnant or nursing, loss of libido, intercourse pain and infertility."
2711,Who is at risk for hyperprolactinaemia?,"Prolactinoma Pituitary tumors Hypothyroidism Sarcoidosis Chronic renal failure Polycystic ovary syndrome Stress Certain medications, including commonly prescribed antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and blood pressure medications. Idiopathic"
2712,How to know you have hyperprolactinaemia?,"Blood hormone test: In patients with hyperprolactinaemia, it may demonstrate elevated prolactin level, low testosterone level and low FSH and LH levels. Cranial MRI or CT scan: In these imaging tests, doctors may detect whether the pituitary tumor exists or not. Visual field examination: For patients with abnormal visual fields, visual field examination by an ophthalmologist is needed."
2713,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperprolactinemia ?,Call your health care provider if you have any symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia.
2714,What to expect if I have Hyperprolactinemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most hyperprolactinaemia have good outcomes with medication.
2715,What are the symptoms of Hypertriglyceridemia?,You may not notice any symptoms. People with the condition may have coronary artery disease at an early age.
2716,What causes Hypertriglyceridemia?,"Familial hypertriglyceridemia is caused by a genetic defect, which is passed on in an autosomal dominant fashion. This means that if you get a bad copy of the gene from just one of your parents, you will have the condition. Some people with this condition also have high levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The reason for the rise in triglycerides and VLDL is not understood. Familial hypertriglyceridemia does not usually become noticeable until puberty or early adulthood. Obesity, hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), and high levels of insulin are often also present and may cause even higher triglyceride levels. Familial hypertriglyceridemia occurs in about 1 in 500 individuals in the United States. Risk factors are a family history of hypertriglyceridemia or a family history of heart disease before the age of 50."
2717,Who is at highest risk for Hypertriglyceridemia ?,Family members with history of hypertriglyceridemia are at increased risk of having the condition.
2718,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypertriglyceridemia ?,You may not notice any symptoms. People with the condition may have coronary artery disease at an early age.
2719,What to expect if I have Hypertriglyceridemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Persons with this condition have an increased risk of coronary artery disease and pancreatitis. Losing weight and keeping diabetes under control helps improve the outcome.
2720,What are the Symptoms of Hypoaldosteronism?,"Common symptoms of hypoaldosteronism include:    
Chronic fatigue Low blood pressure Lightheadedness Palpitations Muscle weakness Anorexia Weight loss Salt craving Dizziness"
2721,What Causes Hypoaldosteronism?,"Common cause of hypoaldosteronism include disorders of kidney and adrenal glands. Some drugs which can block the action of hormone renin or aldosterone may also lead to hypoaldosteronism. Any chronic kidney disease may lead to inadequate production of renin, similarly any adrenal gland disorders may lead to decrease production of aldosterone. Drugs leading top hypoaldosteronism include ACE inhibitor, ARBs, calcineurin inhibitors, nitric oxide and heparin."
2722,Who is at risk for Hypoaldosteronism?,"Common risk factors in the development of hypoaldosteronism include:

Patient having underlying renal disease or diabetic nephropathy may progresses to end stage stage renal disease."
2726,What are the symptoms of Hypochondriasis?,"People with hypochondria are unable to control their fears and worries. They often believe any symptom or sensation is a sign of a serious illness.
They seek out reassurance from family, friends, or health care providers on a regular basis. They feel better for a short time at most, and then begin to worry about the same symptoms, or about new symptoms.
Symptoms may shift and change, and are often vague. People with hypochondria often examine their own body.
Those who are affected may recognize that their fear of having a serious disease is unreasonable or unfounded."
2727,What causes Hypochondriasis?,"People with hypochondria are overly focused on their physical health. They have an unrealistic fear of having a serious disease. This disorder occurs equally in men and women.
The way people with hypochondria think about their physical symptoms can make them more likely to have this condition. As they focus on and worry about physical sensations, a cycle of symptoms and worry begins, which can be difficult to stop.
It is important to realize that people with hypochondria do not purposely create these symptoms (malingering). They are unable to control the symptoms.
People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have this disorder. However, this does not mean that every person with a hypochondria disorder has a history of abuse."

2761,What causes IgA nephropathy?,"IgA is a protein that helps the body fight infections. IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) occurs when too much of this protein is deposited in the kidneys. IgA builds up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney. Structures in the kidney called glomeruli become inflamed.
IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) is a form of mesangial proliferative nephritis.
The disorder can appear suddenly (acute), or progress slowly over many years (chronic glomerulonephritis).
Risk factors include:
A personal or family history of IgA nephropathy or Henoch Schonlein purpura, a form of vasculitis that affects many parts of the body Caucasian or Asian ethnicity"
2762,Who is at highest risk for IgA nephropathy ?,"IgA nephropathy can occur in persons of all ages, but most often affects males in their teens to late 30s. IgA nephropathy is a genetic disorder, so anyone with a family history of the disorder is at risk."

2769,What are the symptoms of Immune hemolytic anemia?,Dark urine Fatigue Pale (pallor) or yellow (jaundice) skin color Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath
2770,What causes Immune hemolytic anemia?,"Immune hemolytic anemia occurs when antibodies form against the body's own red blood cells. The antibodies destroy the blood cells because the immune system mistakenly recognizes these blood cells as foreign material within the body.
The antibodies may be caused by:
Complication of another disease Past blood transfusions Pregnancy (if the baby's blood type is different from the mother's) Reaction to certain medications Reaction to certain infections
Secondary immune hemolytic anemia: If the cause of antibody formation is a disease or medication.
Idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia: accounts for one-half of all immune hemolytic anemias."

2780,What causes Infant of diabetic mother?,"High blood sugar levels in pregnant women often have specific effects on their infants. Infants born to mothers who have diabetes are generally larger than other babies. They may have large organs, particularly the liver, adrenal glands, and heart.
These infants may have episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth because of increased insulin. Insulin is a substance that moves sugar (glucose) from the blood into body tissues. The infant will need close monitoring of blood sugar levels.
There is an increased chance that mothers with poorly controlled diabetes will have a miscarriage or stillborn child.
If the mother was diagnosed with diabetes before the pregnancy, her infant also has an increased risk of having birth defects if the disease is not well controlled."
2781,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Infant of diabetic mother ?,"If you are pregnant and receiving regular prenatal care, routine testing will show if you develop gestational diabetes.
If you are pregnant and have diabetes that is difficult to control, call your doctor immediately.
If you are pregnant and are not receiving prenatal care, make an appointment with your health care provider or call the State Board of Health for instructions on how to obtain state-assisted prenatal care."
2782,What to expect if I have Infant of diabetic mother  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Better control of diabetes and early recognition of gestational diabetes has decreased the number and severity of problems in infants born to mothers with diabetes.
Usually, an infant's symptoms go away within a few weeks. However, an enlarged heart may take several months to get better."
2783,What are the symptoms of Infant respiratory distress syndrome?,"The symptoms usually appear within minutes of birth, although they may not be seen for several hours. Symptoms may include:
Bluish color of the skin and mucus membranes (cyanosis). Brief stop in breathing (apnea). Decreased urine output. Grunting. Nasal flaring. Rapid breathing. Shallow breathing. Shortness of breath and grunting sounds while breathing. Unusual breathing movement -- drawing back of the chest muscles with breathing."
2784,What causes Infant respiratory distress syndrome?,"Infant RDS occurs in infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed.
The disease is mainly caused by a lack of a slippery, protective substance called surfactant, which helps the lungs inflate with air and keeps the air sacs from collapsing. This substance normally appears in fully developed lungs.
Infant RDS can also be the result of genetic problems with lung development.
The earlier a baby is born, the less developed the lungs are and the higher the chance of Infant RDS. Most cases are seen in babies born before 28 weeks. It is very uncommon in infants born full-term (at 40 weeks).
In addition to prematurity, the following increase the risk of Infant RDS:
A brother or sister who had RDS. Diabetes in the mother. Cesarean delivery. Delivery complications that reduce blood flow to the baby. Multiple pregnancy (twins or more). Rapid labor.
The risk of Infant RDS may be decreased if the pregnant mother has chronic, pregnancy-related high blood pressure or prolonged rupture of membranes, because the stress of these situations can cause the infant's lungs to mature sooner."
2785,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Infant respiratory distress syndrome ?,"This disorder usually develops shortly after birth while the baby is still in the hospital. If you have given birth at home or outside a medical center, seek emergency attention if your baby develops any difficulty breathing."
2786,What to expect if I have Infant respiratory distress syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The Infant respiratory distress syndrome often worsens for 2 to 4 days after birth with slow improvement thereafter. Some infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome will die, although this is rare on the first day of life. If it occurs, it usually happens between days 2 and 7.
Long-term complications may develop as a result of too much oxygen, high pressures delivered to the lungs, the severity of the Infant respiratory distress syndrome itself, or periods when the brain or other organs did not receive enough oxygen."
2787,What are the symptoms of Infertility?,"The main symptom of infertility is the inability to become pregnant. Specific symptoms depend on what is causing the infertility.
Infertility can cause many painful emotions in one or both partners."
2788,What causes Infertility?,"A wide range of physical and emotional factors can cause infertility. Infertility may be due to problems in the woman, man, or both.
FEMALE INFERTILITY:
Female infertility may occur when:
A fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it sticks to the lining of the womb (uterus) The fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus The eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb The ovaries have problems producing eggs
Female infertility may be caused by:
Autoimmune disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) Cancer or tumor Clotting disorders Diabetes Growths (such as fibroids or polyps) in the uterus and cervix Birth defects that affect the reproductive tract Excessive exercising Eating disorders or poor nutrition Use of certain medications, including chemotherapy drugs Drinking too much alcohol Obesity Older age Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Pelvic infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Scarring from sexually transmitted infection or endometriosis Thyroid disease Too little or too much hormones
MALE INFERTILITY:
Male infertility may be due to:
A decrease in sperm count Sperm being blocked from being released Sperm that do not work properly
Male infertility can be caused by:
Environmental pollutants Being in high heat for prolonged periods Birth defects Heavy use of alcohol, marijuana or cocaine Too little or too much hormones Impotence Infection Older age Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation Scarring from sexually transmitted diseases, injury, or surgery Retrograde ejaculation Smoking Use of certain drugs, such as cimetidine, spironolactone, and nitrofurantoin
In healthy couples under age 30 who have sex regularly, the chance of getting pregnant is about 25 - 30% per month.
A woman's peak fertility occurs in her early 20s. After age 35 (and especially 40), the chances that a woman can get pregnant drops considerably."
2789,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Infertility ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are unable to get pregnant.
2790,What to expect if I have Infertility  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"As many as 1 in 5 couples diagnosed with infertility eventually become pregnant without treatment.
More than half of couples with infertility become pregnant after treatment, not including advanced techniques such as in vitro fertiliziation (IVF)."
2791,What are the symptoms of Inflammatory bowel disease?,"Symptoms of ulcerative colitis include:
Abdominal pain and cramping that usually disappears after a bowel movement Abdominal sounds (a gurgling or splashing sound heard over the intestine) Diarrhea, from only a few episodes to very often throughout the day (blood and mucus may be present) Fever Tenesmus Weight loss
Other symptoms that may occur with ulcerative colitis include the following:
Gastrointestinal bleeding Joint pain Nausea and vomiting
The main symptoms of Crohn's disease are:
Crampy abdominal (belly area) pain Fever Fatigue Persistent, watery diarrhea
Other symptoms may include:
Abdominal fullness and gas Clotting problems (deep vein thrombosis) Constipation Eye inflammation Fistulas (usually around the rectal area, may cause draining of pus, mucus, or stools) Gastrointestinal bleeding Joint pain Kidney stones Liver inflammation Loss of appetite Pain with passing stool (tenesmus) Rectal bleeding and bloody stools Skin rash Swollen gums Unintentional weight loss"
2792,What are the causes of Inflammatory bowel disease?,"Causes of ulcerative colitis:
The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. It may affect any age group, although there are peaks at ages 15 - 30 and then again at ages 50 - 70.
The disease usually begins in the rectal area and may eventually extend through the entire large intestine. Repeated swelling (inflammation) leads to thickening of the wall of the intestine and rectum with scar tissue. Death of colon tissue or sepsis may occur with severe disease.
The symptoms vary in severity and may start slowly or suddenly. Many factors can lead to attacks, including respiratory infections or physical stress.
Causes of Crohn's disease: While the exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, the condition is linked to a problem with the body's immune system response.
Normally, the immune system helps protect the body, but with Crohn's disease the immune system can't tell the difference between good substances and foreign invaders. The result is an overactive immune response that leads to chronic inflammation. This is called an autoimmune disorder.
There are five different types of Crohn's disease:
Ileocolitis is the most common form. It affects the lowest part of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (colon). Ileitis affects the ileum. Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the stomach and first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine (jejunum). Crohn's (granulomatous) colitis only affects the large intestine.
A person's genes and environmental factors seem to play a role in the development of Crohn's disease. The body may be overreacting to normal bacteria in the intestines.
The inflammation related to Crohn's disease frequently occurs at the end of the small intestine that joins the large intestine, but it may occur in any area of the digestive tract. There can be healthy patches of tissue between diseased areas. The ongoing inflammation causes the intestinal wall to become thick."
2793,Who is at highest risk for Inflammatory bowel disease?,"Risk factors include:
Family history of Crohn's disease Family history of ulcerative colitis Jewish ancestry Smoking Age: it usually occurs in people 15-30 and then again at ages 50-70"
2794,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Inflammatory bowel disease ?,Speak with your doctor and set up an immediate consultation if you experience any of the symptoms associated with Inflammatory bowel disease.
2795,What to expect if I have Inflammatory bowel disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"While IBD can limit quality of life due to pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and other socially unacceptable symptoms, it is rarely fatal on its own. Fatalities due to complications such as toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and surgical complications are also rare.
While patients of IBD do have an increased risk of colorectal cancer this is usually caught much earlier than the general population in routine surveillance of the colon by colonoscopy, and therefore patients are much more likely to survive.
After treatment, the patient is usually switched to a lighter drug with fewer side effects. Every so often an acute resurgence of the original symptoms may appear: this is known as a flare-up. Depending on the circumstances, it may go away on its own or require medication. The time between flare-ups may be anywhere from weeks to years, and varies wildly between patients - a few have never experienced a flare-up."
2796,What are the symptoms of Influenza?,"The flu usually begins abruptly, with a fever between 102 and 106 °F. (An adult typically has a lower fever than a child.) The fever usually lasts for a day or two, but can last 5 days.
Other common symptoms include:
Chills Dizziness Flushed face Headache Nausea Vomiting Tiredness Runny nose Cough Muscle aches
Somewhere between day 2 and day 4 of the illness, the ""whole body"" symptoms begin to subside, and respiratory symptoms begin to increase.
The most prominent of the respiratory symptoms is usually a dry, hacking cough. Most people also develop a sore throat and headache. Runny nose (nasal discharge) and sneezing are common.
These symptoms (except the cough) usually disappear within 4 - 7 days. Sometimes, the fever returns. The cough and tiredness usually last for weeks after the rest of the illness is over.
Other symptoms may include:
Loss of appetite Muscle aches and stiffness Stuffy, congested nose Sweating Worsening of underlying illness, such as asthma or heart failure"
2797,What causes Influenza?,"In temperate climates, influenza A usually arrives between early winter and early spring. Influenza B can appear at any time of the year."
2798,Who is at highest risk for Influenza ?,"Since the flu is contagious, anyone around a person with the flu is at risk."
2799,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Influenza ?,"Call your health care provider if someone in a high-risk category develops symptoms of the flu, or if your illness seems severe."

Difficulty falling asleep on most nights Feeling tired during the day or falling asleep during the day Not feeling refreshed when you wake up Waking up several times during sleep
People who have primary insomnia tend to keep thinking about getting enough sleep. The more they try to sleep, the greater their sense of frustration and distress, and the more difficult sleep becomes."
2803,What causes Insomnia?,"Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that is not caused by any known physical or mental condition.
Insomnia is caused by many different things. The most common causes of insomnia are:
Alcohol Anxiety Coffee Stress
Secondary insomnia is caused by a medical condition. Depression is a very common cause of secondary insomnia. Often, insomnia is the symptom that causes people with depression to seek medical help."
2804,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Insomnia ?,Seek medical attention when insomnia has become a problem.
2805,What to expect if I have Insomnia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A good sleep hygiene usually improves sleep difficulty, but in case it is progressive despite of the lifestyle changes then seek medical help.
It is important to remember that your health is not at risk if you do not get 6 - 8 hours of sleep every day. Different people have different sleep requirements. Some do fine on 4 hours of sleep a night, while others only thrive if they get 10 - 11 hours.
Sleep requirements also change with age. Listen to your body's sleep signals and don't try to sleep more or less than is refreshing for you."
2806,What are the symptoms of Insulinoma?,Anxiety Behavior changes Clouded vision Confusion Convulsions Dizziness Headache Hunger Loss of consciousness Rapid heart rate Sweating Tremor Weight gain
2807,What causes Insulinoma?,"The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen that makes several enzymes and hormones, including the hormone insulin. Insulin's job is to reduce the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by helping it move into cells.
Most of the time when your blood sugar level drops too low, the pancreas stops making insulin until your blood sugar returns to normal. Tumors of the pancreas that produce too much insulin are called insulinomas. Insulinomas keep making insulin, even when your blood sugar drops too low.
High blood insulin levels cause low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia may be mild, leading to symptoms such as anxiety and hunger. Or it can be severe, leading to seizures, coma, and even death.
Insulinomas are rare tumors. They usually occur as single, small tumors in adults.
These tumors are very rare in children. Most children with high blood insulin levels have many areas of overactive insulin-releasing cells in the pancreas, instead of a single tumor.
Taking medications that cause too much insulin in the blood, either accidentally or on purpose, is about as common as insulinoma.
More than 90% of insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors. People with the genetic syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I are at risk for insulinomas and other endocrine tumors."
2808,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Insulinoma ?,Call your health care provider if you develop any symptoms of insulinoma. Convulsions and decreased consciousness are an emergency -- call 911 or your local emergency number.
2809,What to expect if I have Insulinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"As a kind of benign tumor, the prognosis of insulinoma is good. Surgery can cure most patients. But a severe hypoglycemic reaction may be life-threatening for some patients."
2810,What are the symptoms of Interstitial lung disease?,"Shortness of breath is a key symptom of interstitial lung disease. People may breathe faster or need to take deep breaths.
At first, shortness of breath is not severe and you may only notice it with exercise, climbing stairs, and other hard activities. Over time, you may notice it while bathing or dressing, and then while eating or talking.
Most people with this condition also have a dry cough. A dry cough means you do not cough up any mucus or sputum.
Over time, weight loss, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue are also present.
People with advanced ILD may have:
Abnormal enlargement of the base of the fingernails (clubbing). Blue color of the lips, skin, or fingernails due to low blood oxygen levels (cyanosis)."
2811,What causes Interstitial lung disease?,"The lungs contain tiny air sacs (alveoli), which is where oxygen is absorbed. These air sacs open up or expand with each breath.
The tissue around these air sacs is called the interstitium. In people with interstitial lung disease, this tissue becomes stiff or scarred, and the air sacs are not able to expand as much. As a result, not as much oxygen can get into your lungs, and therefore to your body.
Interstitial lung diseases can be broken down into two large groups:
Those that have no known cause (idiopathic ILD). Those with an identifiable cause or that occur along with other diseases.
There are several types of idiopathic ILD. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common type. Less common types include:
Acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP). Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP). Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease (RBILD).
There are dozens of different causes of ILD.
Autoimmune diseases (in which the immune system attacks the body) such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and scleroderma. Certain infections. Certain medications (such as bleomycin, amiodarone, methotrexate, gold, infliximab, etanercept). Radiation therapy to the chest to treat breast cancer, lymphoma, and other cancers. Working with or around asbestos, coal dust, cotton dust, and silica dust.
Cigarette smoking may increase the risk of developing some forms of ILD and may cause the disease to be more severe."
2812,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Interstitial lung disease ?,"Your breathing is getting harder, faster, or more shallow than before. You cannot get a deep breath, or need to lean forward when sitting. You are having headaches more often. You feel sleepy or confused. You have a fever. You are coughing up dark mucus. Your fingertips or the skin around your fingernails is blue."
2813,What to expect if I have Interstitial lung disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Chances of recovery or the disease getting worse depend on the cause, and how severe the disease was when it was first diagnosed."
2814,What are the symptoms of Intrauterine growth retardation?,"A pregnant woman may feel that her baby is as big as it should be.
The measurement from the mother's pubic bone to the top of the uterus will be smaller than expected for the baby's gestational age. This measurement is called the uterine fundal height."
2815,What causes Intrauterine growth retardation?,"Many different things can lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
An unborn baby may not get enough oxygen and nutrition from the placenta during pregnancy because of:
High altitudes Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.) Placenta problems Preeclampsia or eclampsia
Congenital or chromosomal abnormalities are often associated with below-normal weight.
Infections during pregnancy that affect the developing baby, such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis may also affect the weight of the developing baby.
If the mother is small, it may be normal for her the baby to be small, but this is not due to IUGR.
Depending on the cause of IUGR, the developing baby may be symmetrically small, or have a head that is normal size for gestational age, while the remainder of it's body is small."
2816,Who is at highest risk for Intrauterine growth retardation ?,"Risk factors in the mother that may contribute to IUGR include:
Alcohol abuse Clotting disorders Drug addiction High blood pressure or heart disease Kidney disease Poor nutrition Smoking"
2817,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Intrauterine growth retardation ?,"Contact your provider right away if you are pregnant and notice that the baby is moving less than usual.
Also call your health care provider if your infant or child does not seem to be growing or developing normally."
2818,What to expect if I have Intrauterine growth retardation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After delivery, growth and development of the newborn depends on the severity and cause of IUGR.
The baby's outlook should be discussed with your obstetrician and pediatrician."
2819,What are the symptoms of Intraventricular hemorrhage?,"There may be no symptoms. The most common symptoms seen in premature infants may include:
Breathing pauses (apnea) Changes in blood pressure and heart rate Decreased muscle tone Decreased reflexes Excessive sleep Lethargy Weak suck"
2820,What causes Intraventricular hemorrhage?,"Infants born before 30 weeks of pregnancy are at highest risk for such bleeding. The smaller and more premature the infant, the higher the risk for IVH. This is because blood vessels in the brain of premature infants are not yet fully developed and are extremely fragile. The blood vessels grow stronger after 30 weeks of pregnancy.
IVH is more common in premature babies who have had respiratory distress syndrome, high blood pressure, and other conditions. The condition may also occur in healthy premature babies who were born without injury. IVH may develop in full-term babies, but this is very uncommon.
IVH is rarely present at birth. If it occurs, it will usually be in the first several days of life. The condition is quite rare after 1 month of age, no matter how early the baby was born.
IVH falls into four groups, called grades. The higher the grade, the more severe the bleeding.
Grades 1 and 2 involve a small amount of bleeding and do not usually cause long-term problems. Grades 3 and 4 involve more severe bleeding, which presses on or leaks into brain tissue. Blood clots can form and block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to increased fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus)."
2821,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Intraventricular hemorrhage ?,Regular doctor's visits are recommended for several years after being diagnosed with an IVH. The doctor will check the child's developmental and make sure the bleeding has not damaged the brain.
2822,What to expect if I have Intraventricular hemorrhage  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,How well the infant does depends on the amount of bleeding and if there is brain swelling. Severe bleeding may lead to developmental delays and problems controlling movement.
2823,What are the symptoms of Iron deficiency anemia?,"You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild.
Most of the time, symptoms are mild at first and develop slowly. Symptoms may include:
Feeling grumpy Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise Headaches Problems concentrating or thinking
As the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:
Blue color to the whites of the eyes Brittle nails Light-headedness when you stand up Pale skin color Shortness of breath Sore tongue
Symptoms of the conditions that cause iron deficiency anemia include:
Dark, tar-colored stools or blood Heavy menstrual bleeding (women) Pain in the upper belly (from ulcers) Weight loss (in people with cancer)"
2824,What causes Iron deficiency anemia?,"Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of Anemia (patient information}|anemia.
Red blood cells bring oxygen to the body's tissues. Healthy red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells move through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells.
Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron, the blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet and by re-using iron from old red blood cells.
You get iron deficiency anemia when your body's iron stores run low. You can get iron deficiency if:
You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace Your body does not do a good job of absorbing iron Your body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods with iron in them Your body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding)
Iron loss can be due to bleeding. Common causes of bleeding are:
Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periods Cancer in the esophagus, stomach, or colon Esophageal varices The use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or arthritis medicines for a long time Peptic ulcer disease
The body may not absorb enough iron in the diet due to:
Celiac disease Crohn's disease Gastric bypass surgery Taking too many antacids that contain calcium
You may not get enough iron in the diet if:
You are a strict vegetarian You are an older adult and do not eat a full diet"
2825,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Iron deficiency anemia in adults ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of this disorder You notice blood in your stool"
2826,What to expect if I have Iron deficiency anemia in adults  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, the outcome is likely to be good. However, it does depend on the cause. Usually, blood counts will return to normal in 2 months."
2827,What are the symptoms of Iron deficiency anemia in children?,"If anemia is mild, there may be no symptoms.
Blue-tinged or very pale whites of eyes Blood in the stools Brittle nails Decreased appetite (especially in children) Fatigue Headache Irritability Pale skin color (pallor) Shortness of breath Sore tongue Unusual food cravings (called pica) Weakness"
2828,What causes Iron deficiency anemia in children?,"Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia. You get iron through certain foods, and your body also reuses iron from old red blood cells.
Iron deficiency (too little iron) may be caused by:
An iron-poor diet (this is the most common cause) Body not being able to absorb iron very well, even though you're eating enough iron Long-term, slow blood loss: usually through menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive tract Rapid growth (in the first year of life and in adolescence), when more iron is needed
Babies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and children need to absorb an average of 1 mg of iron per day.
Since children only absorb about 10% of the iron they eat, most children need to receive 8-10 mg of iron per day. Breastfed babies need less, because iron is absorbed 3 times better when it is in breast milk.
Cow’s milk is a common cause of iron deficiency. It contains less iron than many other foods and also makes it more difficult for the body to absorb iron from other foods. Cow's milk also can cause the intestines to lose small amounts of blood.
Iron deficiency in children also can be related to lead poisoning."
2829,Who is at highest risk for Iron deficiency anemia in children ?,"The risk of developing iron deficiency anemia is increased in:
Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula Young children who drink a lot of cow's milk rather than eating foods that supply the body with more iron
Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 - 24 months old. All babies should have a screening test for iron deficiency at this age. Babies born prematurely may need to be tested earlier."
2830,What to expect if I have Iron deficiency anemia in children  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, the outcome is likely to be good. In most cases, the blood counts will return to normal in 2 months. It is essential to determine the cause of the iron deficiency.
You should continue taking iron supplements for another 6 to 12 months after blood counts return to normal, or as your health care provider recommends. This will help the body rebuild its iron storage.
Iron supplementation improves learning, memory, and cognitive test performance in adolescents who have low levels of iron. Iron supplementation also improves the performance of athletes with anemia and iron deficiency."
2831,What causes Jaundice?,"Everyday, a small number of red blood cells in your body die, and are replaced by new ones. The liver removes the old blood cells, forming bilirubin. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed by the body in the stool.
When too much bilirubin builds up in the body, jaundice may result.
Jaundice can occur if:
Too many red blood cells are dying or breaking down and going to the liver The liver is overloaded or damaged The bilirubin from the liver is unable to move through the digestive tract properly
Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Infections, use of certain drugs, cancer, blood disorders, gallstones, birth defects and a number of other medical conditions can lead to jaundice. For more information on the causes of jaundice see: jaundice causes"
2832,How do I know if my child has Kallmann syndrome and what are the symptoms of Kallmann syndrome?,"Usual signs and symptoms include:
Underdeveloped testicles Lack of development at puberty and absence of secondary sexual characteristics such as pubic, facial, and underarm hair Short stature Anosmia"
2833,Who is at risk for Kallmann syndrome?,"Researches have demonstrated gene mutations in the KAL1, FGFR1, PROKR2, and PROK2 cause Kallmann syndrome."
2834,How to know you have Kallmann syndrome?,"Clinical appearance is the base for the diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome. Hormone tests: Hormones such as estrogen, FSH, LH or testosterone, and thyroid, prolactin are needed to check to help doctors identify the diagnosis. LH response to GnRH: This test is used to tell the difference between primary and secondary hypogonadism and can indirectly determine the pituitary gland's ability to appropriately respond to GnRH, a hormone produced in the hypothalamus. During the procedure, blood samples are drawn before and after the injection of GnRH. Cranial MRI: This imaging in patients with Kallmann syndrome may show deficient of olfactory bulb."
2835,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Kallmann syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you have any signs and symptoms of Kallmann syndrome.
2836,What to expect if I have Kallmann syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With the right hormone treatment, the person can begin puberty and fertility may be recoverd."
2837,What are the symptoms of Kernicterus?,"The symptoms depend on the stage of kernicterus.
Early stage:
Extreme jaundice Absent startle reflex Poor feeding or sucking Extreme sleepiness (lethargy)
Mid stage:
High-pitched cry Arched back with neck hyperextended backwards Bulging fontanel (soft spot) Seizures
Late stage (full neurological syndrome):
High-frequency hearing loss Mental retardation Muscle rigidity Speech difficulties Seizures Movement disorder"
2838,What causes Kernicterus?,"Kernicterus is caused by very high levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is created in the body during the normal recycling of old red blood cells. High levels of bilirubin in the body can cause the skin to look yellow (which is called jaundice).
In some cases when there are extremely high levels of bilirubin in the body or the baby is extremely ill, the substance will move out of the blood and collect in the brain tissue. This can lead to serious neurological complications, including brain damage and hearing loss.
Kernicterus usually develops in the first week of life, but may be seen up until the third week. Newborns with Hemolytic disease of the newborn (patient information)
Rh hemolytic disease that may lead to hydrops fetalis are at high risk for severe jaundice that leads to this condition. However, kernicterus has been seen in apparently healthy babies."
2839,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Kernicterus ?,Seek immediate medical help if your baby has signs of this condition.
2840,What to expect if I have Kernicterus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Kernicterus is a serious condition. The outcome is guarded. Many infants with late stage nervous system complications die.
2841,What are the symptoms of Kidney abscess?,"Symptoms of perirenal abscess include:
Chills Fever Pain in the flank (side of the abdomen) or abdomen, which may extend to the groin or down the leg Sweats"
2842,What causes Kidney abscess?,"Most perirenal abscesses are caused by urinary tract infections that start in the bladder, spread to the kidney, and then spread to the area around the kidney. Other causes of perirenal abscess include surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system and bloodstream infection."
2843,Who is at highest risk for Kidney abscess ?,"The biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is kidney stones that block the flow of urine and provide a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics can't kill the bacteria there.
Stones are found in 20 - 60% of patients with perirenal abscess. Other risk factors for perirenal abscess include:
Diabetes Having an abnormal urinary tract Trauma"
2844,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Kidney abscess ?,"Call your health care provider if you have a history of kidney stones and develop:
Abdominal pain Burning with urination Chills Fever Urinary tract infection"
2845,What to expect if I have Kidney abscess  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In general, quick diagnosis and treatment of perirenal abscess should lead to a good outcome. Kidney stones must be treated to avoid further infections.
In rare cases, the infection can spread beyond the kidney area and into the bloodstream, which can be deadly."
2846,What are the symptoms of Kidney cancer?,"Early kidney cancer does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Hematuria (blood in the urine)
Lower back pain on one side
A mass or lump on one side of the lower back
Fatigue and unexplained weight loss
Edema of ankles and legs
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. The conditions are
Urinary calculi
Urinary tract infection
Bladder cancer and ureter cancer
Urinary tract tuberculosis"
2847,What causes Kidney cancer?,"We do not yet know exactly what causes kidney cancer, but we do know that certain risk factors are linked to the disease which are listed below"
2848,Who is at highest risk for Kidney cancer ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of kidney cancer is related to several factors.
Genetic and hereditary risk factors
Von Hippel-Lindau disease Hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome Hereditary renal oncocytoma
Lifestyle-related and job-related risk factors
Smoking: Tobacco use increases the risk of developing renal cell carcinoma. Obesity: Clinical surveys demonstrate that kidney cancer has a close relationship with people who are very overweight. Workplace exposures: Clinical studies have suggested that workplace exposure to certain substances such as asbestos, cadmium, some herbicides, benzene, and organic solvents, particularly trichloroethylene, may increase the risk for kidney cancer.
Drugs: Some studies have suggested that phenacetin (non-prescription pain reliever) and diuretics (medicines uesd to treat hypertension or heart failure by causing the kidneys to remove salt and fluid from the body) may be linked to kidney cancer. Advanced kidney disease: People with advanced kidney disease, especially those needing dialysis, have a higher risk of kidney cancer. The reasons may be the accumulation of the metabolic toxin. A family history of kidney cancer Hypertension Gender: Men have about twice the risk of developing kidney cancer than women. Race: Epidemical data shows that African Americans have a slightly higher rate of kidney cancer than other races."
2849,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Kidney cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of kidney cancer develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe low back pain or abdominal pain A large amount of hematuria"
2850,What to expect if I have Kidney cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on:
The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the kidneys. The individual's response to treatment"
2851,What are the symptoms of Kidney stone?,"The main symptom is severe pain that starts suddenly and may go away suddenly:
Pain may be felt in the belly area or side of the back Pain may move to groin area (groin pain) or testicles (testicle pain)
Other symptoms can include:
Abnormal urine color Blood in the urine Chills Fever Nausea Vomiting"
2852,What causes Kidney stone?,"Kidney stones can form when urine contains too much of certain substances. These substances can create small crystals that become stones.
Kidney stones may not produce symptoms until they begin to move down the tubes (ureters) through which urine empties into the bladder. When this happens, the stones can block the flow of urine out of the kidneys. This causes swelling of the kidney or kidneys, causing pain. The pain is usually severe.
Kidney stones are common. A person who has had kidney stones often gets them again in the future. Kidney stones often occur in premature infants.
Some types of stones tend to run in families. Certain kinds of stones can occur with bowel disease, ileal bypass for obesity, or renal tubule defects.
There are different types of kidney stones. The exact cause depends on the type of stone.
Calcium stones are most common. They occur more often in men than in women, and usually appear between ages 20 - 30. They are likely to come back. Calcium can combine with other substances, such as oxalate (the most common substance), phosphate, or carbonate to form the stone. Oxalate is present in certain foods. Diseases of the small intestine increase the risk of forming calcium oxalate stones. Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria. This disorder runs in families and affects both men and women. Struvite stones are mostly found in women who have a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney, ureter, or bladder. Uric acid stones are more common in men than in women. They can occur with gout or chemotherapy.
Other substances also can form stones."
2853,Who is at highest risk for Kidney stone ?,The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is dehydration.
2854,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Kidney stone ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of a kidney stone.
Also call if symptoms return, urination becomes painful, urine output decreases, or other new symptoms develop."
2855,What to expect if I have Kidney stone  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Kidney stones are painful but usually can be removed from the body without causing permanent damage. They tend to return, especially if the cause is not found and treated."
2856,What are the symptoms of Klinefelter's syndrome?,"The most common symptom is infertility. Other symptoms may include:
Abnormal body proportions (long legs, short trunk, shoulder equal to hip size) Enlarged breasts (gynecomastia) Sexual problems Less than normal amount of pubic, armpit, and facial hair Small, firm testicles Small penis Tall height"
2857,What are the causes of Klinefelter's syndrome?,"Humans have 46 chromosomes. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. The two sex chromosomes determine if you become a boy or a girl. Females normally have two of the same sex chromosomes, written as XX. Males normally have an X and a Y chromosome (written as XY).
Klinefelter's syndrome is one of a group of sex chromosome problems. It results in males who have at least one extra X chromosome. Usually, this occurs due to one extra X (written as XXY).
Klinefelter's syndrome is found in about 1 out of every 500 - 1,000 newborn males. Women who have pregnancies after age 35 are slightly more likely to have a boy with this syndrome than younger women."
2858,Who is at highest risk for Klinefelter%27s syndrome ?,"Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic disorder, so anyone with a family history of the syndrome is at risk."
2859,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Klinefelter%27s syndrome ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if a boy does not develop secondary sexual characteristics at puberty.
A genetics counselor can provide information about this condition, and help explain abnormal chromosome findings and possible complications. The counselor will also be familiar with local and national support groups.
An endocrinologist and infertility specialist may also be helpful."
2860,What to expect if I have Klinefelter%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most patients have a normal, productive life."
2861,What are the symptoms of Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"LKS occurs most frequently in normally developing children who are between 3 and 7 years of age. For no apparent reason, these children begin having trouble understanding what is said to them. Doctors often refer to this problem as auditory agnosiaor ""word deafness."" The auditory agnosia may occur slowly or very quickly. Parents often think that the child is developing a hearing problem or has become suddenly deaf. Hearing tests, however, show normal hearing. Children may also appear to be autistic or developmentally delayed.
The inability to understand language eventually affects the child's spoken language which may progress to a complete loss of the ability to speak (mutism). Children who have learned to read and write before the onset of auditory agnosia can often continue communicating through written language. Some children develop a type of gestural communication or sign-like language. The communication problems may lead to behavioral or psychological problems. Intelligence usually appears to be unaffected.
The loss of language may be preceded by an epileptic seizure that usually occurs at night. At some time, 80 percent of children with LKS have one or more seizures. The seizures usually stop by the time the child becomes a teenager. All LKS children have abnormal electrical brain activity on both the right and left sides of their brains."
2862,What causes Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"LKS affects the parts of the brain that control comprehension and speech. The disorder usually occurs in children between the ages of 5 and 7 years. Typically, children with LKS develop normally but then lose their language skills for no apparent reason. While many of the affected individuals have seizures, some do not."
2863,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Landau-Kleffner syndrome ?,Contact your doctor when you observe the above mentioned symptoms in your child.
2864,What to expect if I have Landau-Kleffner syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis for children with LKS varies. Some affected children may have a permanent severe language disorder, while others may regain much of their language abilities (although it may take months or years). In some cases, remission and relapse may occur. The prognosis is improved when the onset of the disorder is after age 6 and when speech therapy is started early. Seizures generally disappear by adulthood."
2865,What are the symptoms of Language disorders?,"A child with language disorder may have one or two of the symptoms listed below, or many of the symptoms. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.
Children with a receptive language disorder have difficulty understanding language. They may have:
A hard time understanding what other people have said Problems following directions that are spoken to them Problems organizing their thoughts
Children with an expressive language disorder have problems using language to express what they are thinking or need. These children may:
Have a hard time putting words together into sentences, or their sentences may be simple and short and the word order may be off Have difficulty finding the right words when talking, and often use placeholder words such as ""um"" Have a vocabulary that is below the level of other children the same age Leave words out of sentences when talking Use certain phrases over and over again, and repeat (echo) parts or all of questions Use tenses (past, present, future) improperly
Because of their language problems, these children may have difficulty in social settings. At times, language disorders may be part of the cause of severe behavioral problems."
2866,What causes Language disorders?,"For most infants and children, language develops naturally beginning at birth. To develop language, a child must be able to hear, see, understand, and remember. Children must also have the physical ability to form speech.
Up to 1 out of every 20 children has symptoms of a language disorder.
When the cause is unknown, it is called a developmental language disorder.
Problems with receptive language skills usually begin before age 4. Some mixed language disorders are caused by a brain injury, and these are sometimes misdiagnosed as developmental disorders.
Language disorders may occur in children with other developmental problems, autistic spectrum disorders, hearing loss, and learning disabilities.
A language disorder may also be caused by damage to the central nervous system, which is called aphasia.
Language disorders are rarely caused by a lack of intelligence.
Language disorders are different than delayed language.
With delayed language, the child develops speech and language in the same way as other children, but later. In language disorders, speech and language do not develop normally. The child may have some language skills, but not others. Or, the way in which these skills develop will be different than usual."
2867,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Language disorder ?,"Parents who are concerned that their child's speech or language is delayed should see their primary care provider. Ask about getting a referral to a speech and language therapist.
Children who are diagnosed with this condition may need to be seen by a neurologist or children's developmental specialist to determine if the cause can be treated.
Call your child's health care provider if you see the following signs that your child does not understand language well:
At 15 months: does not look or point at 5 to 10 people or objects when they are named by a parent or caregiver At 18 months: does not follow simple directions, such as ""get your coat"" At 24 months: is not able to point to a picture or a part of the body when it is named At 30 months: does not respond out loud or by nodding or shaking the head and asking questions At 36 months: does not follow 2-step directions, and does not understand action words
Also call if you notice these signs that your child does not use or express language well:
At 15 months: is not using three words At 18 months: is not saying, ""Mama,"" ""Dada,"" or other names At 24 months: is not using at least 25 words At 30 months: is not using two-word phrases, including phrases that include both a noun and a verb At 36 months: does not have at least a 200-word vocabulary, is not asking for items by name, exactly repeats questions spoken by others, language has regressed (become worse), or is not using complete sentences At 48 months: often uses words incorrectly or uses a similar or related word instead of the correct word"
2868,What to expect if I have Language disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies based on the cause. Brain injury or other structural problems generally have a poor outcome, in which the child will have long-term problems with language. Other, more reversible causes can be treated effectively.
Many children who have language problems during the preschool years will also have some language problems or learning difficulty later in childhood. They may also have reading disorders."
2869,What are the symptoms of Large for gestational age?,"Gestational age is a measure of the growth and development of the fetus in the uterus and the infant after birth.
LGA refers to a fetus or infant who is larger than expected for the age and gender or with a birth weight above the 90th percentile."
2870,What causes Large for gestational age?,"Common causes of a fetus or infant who is large for gestational age are:
Gestational diabetes Prolonged pregnancy"
2871,How do I know if I have Laron syndrome and what are the symptoms of Laron syndrome?,"The principal feature of Laron syndrome is abnormally short stature
Short hands and short feet Unusual facies: Prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, blue sclera, saddle nose and depressed nose bridge Proportionally larger head and abnormal skull growth High-pitched voice Reduced or normal intelligence Delayed bone age Delayed menstruation onset in girls Small penis in boys Delayed sexual development Childlike proportions in adults Obesity"
2872,Who is at risk for Laron syndrome?,Clinical investigations have demonstrated that the cause of Laron syndrome is associated with gene mutations in growth hormone receptor.
2873,How to know you have Laron syndrome?,"Blood hormone tests, including the level of growth hormone (GH), insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-I), insulinlike growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), basal GH, and GH binding protein (GHBP). Other tests invlove an IGF/IGFBP-3 generation test and provocative GH test. The doctor will manage the test and explain the results to you. Blood glucose and lipid test: It may show hypoglycemia and hypercholesterolemia in patients with Laron syndrome. A bone age test: For children suspect Laron syndrome, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans can be used to determine bone age. Cranial MRI: The goal of cranial MRI is to rule out growth hormone deficiency caused by other damages, such as tumor or injure in hypothalamus and pituitary glands."
2874,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Laron syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if your child seems delayed growth.
2875,What to expect if I have Laron syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis of Laron syndrome is not bad. Alert hypoglycemia is very important.
2876,What are the symptoms of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,"Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Cough Coughing up blood Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks Neck pain Sore throat that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks, even with antibiotics Swelling or lumps in the neck Unintentional weight loss"
2877,What causes Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Excessive alcohol use also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancers.
2878,Who is at highest risk for Laryngeal cancer ?,Most cancers of the throat develop in adults older than 50. Men are 10 times more likely than women to develop throat cancers.

Additional symptoms include:
Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough Headache Excessive sweating and clammy skin Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue Confusion, especially in older people"
2913,What causes Pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is a common illness that affects millions of people each year in the United States. Germs called bacteria, viruses, and fungi may cause pneumonia.
Ways you can get pneumonia include:
Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to your lungs. You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs. You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or secretions from the mouth into your lungs (aspiration pneumonia)
Pneumonia caused by bacteria tends to be the most serious. In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.
The most common pneumonia-causing germ in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Atypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is sometimes seen in people whose immune system is impaired (due to AIDS or certain medications that suppress the immune system). Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae are other bacteria that can cause pneumonia. Tuberculosis can cause pneumonia in some people, especially those with a weak immune system.
Viruses are also a common cause of pneumonia, especially in infants and young children.

Your doctor may want to make sure your chest x-ray becomes normal again after you take a course of antibiotics. However, it may take many weeks for your x-ray to clear up."
2917,What are the symptoms of Liposarcoma?,"Liposarcoma is asymtpomatic in intial stage. As it progresses, depending on the location, following symptoms may be found.
Swelling/Lump at any part of your body. It may be soft or firm and usually slow growing. Constipation Diarrhea Blood in stools Blood in vomitus Abdominal pain Urinary disturbances Breathing difficulties"
2918,What causes Liposarcoma?,"The cause of liposarcoma is unknown. Although liposarcoma can arise after a trauma, a benign lump may also cause liposarcoma"
2919,Who is at highest risk for Liposarcoma ?,"Research has indicated that liposarcoma can develop due to several factors.
Radiation: People who have been exposed to radiation therapy for other types of cancer such as lymphoma, breast cancer has increased risk of developing liposarcoma in the area treated with radiation. Genetics: Some genetic diseases may increase the risk of developing liposarcoma, like the following.
Neurofibromatosis (NF1; von Recklinghausen disease) Gardner syndrome (Familial adenomatous polyposis) Li-Fraumeni syndrome Retinoblastoma Werner syndrome Nevoid basal cell carcinoma (Gorlin syndrome)
Exposure to chemicals such as given below may increase the risk of developing liposarcoma.
Vinyl chloride Arsenic Thorium dioxide(Thorotrast)"
2920,How to know you have liposarcoma?,"A physical examination by the doctor is one of the first processes in diagnosing the disease. A deep seated large swelling which is firm and fixed to underlying structure should arise suspicion.
X-ray: Plain x-ray may be done to see the tumor and the adjacent areas. It is usually done in case the tumor is in chest, abdomen or limbs or bones. It helps to understand whether tumor has damaged the bone or spread to other areas.
Biopsy: A biopsy is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of liposarcoma. It could be a needle biopsy or surgical biopsy. In needle biopsy, the doctor usually performs a punch biopsy and removes a tiny round piece of tissue using needle or a small tool. For bigger tissues, an incision may be made and surgical biopsy is used. The sample is sent to a lab where the pathologists can detect the tissues under the microscope and identify the type.
Computed tomography CT scan and biopsy: Local CT scans are often used to diagnose soft tissue sarcoma. A CT machine takes multiple images of your body and various organs to check for tumor and extent of spread. A dye may be injected to visualize better and take clearer images. Inform the doctor if there is a prior allergy to the contrast dye. CAT scan confirm the location of the cancer and show the organs nearby. These are helpful for determining the stage of the cancer and in determining whether surgery is a good treatment option. CT scans can also be used to guide biopsy and a biopsy sample is usually removed and looked at under a microscope.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI uses magnetic fields but it is a different type of image than what is produced by computed tomography (CT) and produces detailed images of the body. The magnets and the computer takes multiple pictures of your body with the tumor and helps to visualize the organs, blood vessels, bones, soft tissues and helps in diagnosing accurately. Like computed tomography (CT), a contrast agent may be injected into a patient’s vein to create a better picture. Inform the doctor if you have prior contrast dye allergy. Do not wear metals while undergoing the proceedure as metals can cause injury.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan: When doing this test, a small amount of a radioactive medium is injected into your body and absorbed by the organs or tissues. This radioactive substance gives off energy which in turn is used to produce the images. PET can provide more helpful information than either CT or MRI scans. It is useful to see if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and it is also useful for your doctor to locate where the cancer has spread. Inform the caregiver if you had prior contrast allergy.
Whole Bone Scan: The goal of a whole body bone scan is to show if a cancer has metastasized to your bones."
2921,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Liposarcoma ?,"Call your doctor if any symptoms of liposarcoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain
Hemorrhage in gastrointestinal tract such as hematochezia or hematemesis, or even shock
Difficulty breathing
DIfficult to speak
Chest pain
Not able to move limb
Pain or loss of sensation in and around the area of the tumor"
2922,What to expect if I have Liposarcoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of liposarcoma is poor and it depends on the following:

Whether the sarcoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery"
2923,What are the Symptoms of Listeriosis?,"The symptoms vary with the infected person:
In infants, symptoms of listeriosis may be seen in the first few days of life and may include: Loss of appetite Lethargy Jaundice Vomiting Respiratory distress (usually pneumonia) Shock Skin rash Increased pressure inside the skull (due to meningitis) possibly causing suture separation
Late-onset infection in the infant (symptoms appear age 5 days or older) and infection in children is often seen as meningitis.
In adults, the disease may take many forms depending on what organ or organ systems are infected. It may occur as meningitis, pneumonia, septicemia, and endocarditis, or in milder forms as abscesses, skin lesion, and conjunctivitis. Symptoms, in addition to fever and muscle aches, can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches, often preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has ""invasive"" infection, in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract.
Pregnant women: Pregnant women typically experience only a mild, flu -like illness. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn."
2924,What Causes Listeriosis?,"You get listeriosis by eating food contaminated with Listeria. Babies can be born with listeriosis if their mothers eat contaminated food during pregnancy. However, healthy persons may consume contaminated foods without becoming ill. Persons at risk can prevent Listeria infection by avoiding certain high-risk foods and by handling food properly.
The bacterium has been found in a variety of foods, such as:
Uncooked meats and vegetables Unpasteurized (raw) milk and cheeses as well as other foods made from unpasteurized milk Cooked or processed foods, including certain soft cheeses, processed (or ready-to-eat) meats, and smoked seafood
Listeria are killed by cooking and pasteurization. However, in some ready-to-eat meats, such as hot dogs and deli meats, contamination may occur after factory cooking but before packaging or even at the deli counter.
Also, be aware that Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso fresco) made from pasteurized milk and likely contaminated during cheese-making have caused Listeria infections.
Unlike most bacteria, Listeria can grow and multiply in some foods in the refrigerator."
2925,Who is at highest risk for Listeriosis ?,"Vegetables, meats, and other foods you eat can get infected with the bacteria if they come in contact with contaminated soil or manure. Raw milk or products made from raw milk may carry these bacteria. If you eat the contaminated products, you may get sick.
The following groups are at increased risk: 
Pregnant women: About one in seven (14%) cases of Listeria infection occurs during pregnancy. The bacteria may cross the placenta and infect the developing baby. Infection during pregnancy can cause fetal loss (miscarriage or stillbirth), preterm labor, and illness or death in newborn infants.
Pregnant women are about 10 times more likely than the general population to get Listeria infection.
Pregnant Hispanic women are about 24 times more likely than the general population to get Listeria infection
Older adults: More than half (58%) of Listeria infections occur among adults 65 and older.
Adults 65 years and older are about 4 times more likely than the general population to get Listeria infection.
People with weakened immune systems - Individuals within this group also have a higher risk for Listeria infection due to underlying medical conditions such as cancer and immunosuppresive therapy (i.e., steroids, chemotherapy, radiation), liver or kidney disease, diabetes, alcoholism, and HIV / AIDS."
2926,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Listeriosis ?,If you develop fever and chills while pregnant or if you are very sick with fever and muscle aches or stiff neck consult your doctor. A blood or spinal fluid test (to look for the bacteria) will show if you have listeriosis.
2927,Where to Find Medical Care for Listeriosis?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Listeriosis
2928,What to expect if I have Listeriosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Listeriosis in a fetus or infant results in a poor outcome with a high death rate. Healthy older children and adults have a lower death rates.
Even with prompt treatment, some listeriosis cases result in death. This is particularly likely in older adults and in persons with other serious medical problems."

A cough that gets worse or does not go away Breathing trouble, such as shortness of breath Constant chest pain Coughing up blood A hoarse voice Frequent lung infections, such as pneumonia Feeling very tired all the time Weight loss with no known cause
Most often these symptoms are not due to cancer. Other health problems can cause some of these symptoms. Anyone with such symptoms should see a doctor to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
2938,What causes Lung cancer?,"Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.
Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45.
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer.
The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking, the greater your risk of lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk.
However, lung cancer has occurred in people who have never smoked.
Secondhand smoke (breathing the smoke of others) increases your risk of lung cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 3,000 nonsmoking adults will die each year from lung cancer related to breathing secondhand smoke.
The following may also increase one's risk of lung cancer:
High levels of air pollution High levels of arsenic in drinking water Radon gas Asbestos Family history of lung cancer Radiation therapy to the lungs Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust"
2939,Who is at highest risk for Lung cancer ?,"Studies have found the following risk factors for lung cancer:
Tobacco smoke: Tobacco smoke causes most cases of lung cancer. It's by far the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Harmful substances in smoke damage lung cells. That's why smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars can cause lung cancer and why secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmokers. The more a person is exposed to smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. For more information, see the NCI fact sheets Quitting Smoking and Secondhand Smoke.
Radon: Radon is a radioactive gas that you cannot see, smell, or taste. It forms in soil and rocks. People who work in mines may be exposed to radon. In some parts of the country, radon is found in houses. Radon damages lung cells, and people exposed to radon are at increased risk of lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer from radon is even higher for smokers. For more information, see the NCI fact sheet Radon and Cancer.
Asbestos and other substances: People who have certain jobs (such as those who work in the construction and chemical industries) have an increased risk of lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, soot, tar, and other substances can cause lung cancer. The risk is highest for those with years of exposure. The risk of lung cancer from these substances is even higher for smokers.
Air pollution: Air pollution may slightly increase the risk of lung cancer. The risk from air pollution is higher for smokers.
Family history of lung cancer: People with a father, mother, brother, or sister who had lung cancer may be at slightly increased risk of the disease, even if they don't smoke.
Personal history of lung cancer: People who have had lung cancer are at increased risk of developing a second lung tumor.
Age over 65: Most people are older than 65 years when diagnosed with lung cancer."

Dysphagia Difficulty breathing Constipation Failure to thrive"
2943,What causes Lymphangioma?,"There are no known direct causes for lymphangioma. Cystic hygroma usually presents in syndromes such as Turner syndrome and Down syndrome. Therefore it is thought that the lymphatic malformations can arise from gene mutations, occuring as missing or deleted part of chromosomes. Acquired lymphangioma circumscriptum occur as a sequele of chronic lymphatic obstruction such as after surgery, infections or radiotherapy"

The infection can cause diarrhea and lower abdominal pain. Women may develop abnormal connections called fistulas between the vagina and rectum."
2954,What causes Lymphogranuloma venereum?,Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a chronic (long-term) infection of the lymphatic system caused by three different types of the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. The bacteria spread through sexual contact. The infection is caused by a different bacteria than that which causes genital chlamydia.
2955,Who is at highest risk for Lymphogranuloma venereum ?,"LGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America. Every year, a few hundred cases of LGV are diagnosed in the United States. However, the actual number of infections is unknown.
LGV is more common in men than women. The main risk factor is having multiple sexual partners."
2956,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Lymphogranuloma venereum ?,"Call your health care provider if you have been in contact with someone who may a sexually transmitted disease, including LVG. Also call if symptoms of LVG develop."
2957,What to expect if I have Lymphogranuloma venereum  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, the outlook is good."
2958,What are the symptoms of Lymphoma?,"Soaking night sweats Swollen, painless lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin Unexplained weight loss Fever Coughing, trouble breathing or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away Pain, swelling or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen"
2959,What causes Lymphoma?,"Non-Hodgkin lymphomas begin when a type of white blood cell, called a T cell or B cell, becomes abnormal. The cell divides again and again, making more abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can spread to almost any other part of the body. Most of the time, doctors can't determine why a person gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
2960,Who is at highest risk for Lymphoma ?,"Risk factor is anything that changes your chance of getting a disease like cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable and some are non modifiable. Having the risk factor doesn't always mean that you will get the disease but it certainly increases your chances as compared to general population.
Risk factors for lymphoma are as under:
Age Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people. Gender Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known. Race, Ethinicity and Geography In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL. Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world. Family history Having a first degree relative (parent, child, sibling) with NHL increases your risk of developing NHL.
Exposure to certain chemicals Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress. Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it’s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment. Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below). Radiation exposure Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia,and thyroid cancer. Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Autoimmmune diseases Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sjögren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL. Certain infections Epstein-barr virus (EBV) Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Helicobacter pylori Chlamydophila psittaci Campylobacter jejuni Hepatitis C Body Weight and Diet Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk. Breast implants It is rare, but some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast. This seems to be more likely with implants that have textured (rough) surfaces (as opposed to smooth surfaces)."
2961,What are the symptoms of Macular degeneration?,"At first there may not be any symptoms. However, as the disease progresses, central vision may be affected. It is very important to note that macular degeneration typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision, meaning patients will not have complete vision loss from this disease. Although specific symptoms vary by whether the form is dry or wet, both forms cause no pain.
More detailed symptoms by type include:
Dry macular degeneration: The most common early sign is blurred vision in the center of the field of vision. As fewer cells in the macula are able to function, people will see details less clearly in front of them. Often objects in the central vision look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. Often this blurred vision will go away in brighter light. A patient may have trouble reading print or seeing other details, but can generally see well enough to walk and perform most routine activities. If the loss of these light-sensing cells becomes great, people may see a small, but growing, blind spot in the middle of their field of vision. In the later stages, patients may not be able to recognize faces until people are close to them. Dry macular degeneration generally affects both eyes, but vision can be lost in one eye while the other eye seems unaffected. Wet macular degeneration: The classic early symptom is that straight lines appear distorted and wavy. This results when fluid from the leaking blood vessels gathers and lifts the macula, distorting vision. A small blind spot may also appear in wet macular degeneration, resulting in loss of one's central vision. Central vision loss can occur very quickly. If this occurs, the patient urgently needs evaluation by an ophthalmologist with experience in retina disease."
2962,What causes Macular degeneration?,"Macular degeneration is caused by damage to the area around blood vessels that supply the macula. Although scientists are not sure what causes this to happen, the change in the blood vessels is what damages the macula."
2963,Who is at highest risk for Macular degeneration ?,"The greatest risk factor is age. Although macular degeneration may occur during middle age, studies show that people over age 60 are at greater risk than other age groups. For instance, a large study found that people in middle-age have about a 2% risk of getting macular degeneration, but this risk increased to nearly 30% in those over age 75.
Other risk factors include:
Smoking: Smoking may increase the risk of macular degeneration. Obesity: Research studies suggest a link between obesity and the progression of early and intermediate stage macular degeneration to advanced macular degeneration. Race: Caucasians are much more likely to lose vision from macular degeneration than African Americans. Family history: Those with immediate family members who have macular degeneration are at a higher risk of developing the disease. Gender: Women appear to be at greater risk than men. Diet: Diets high in fat may increase the risk of macular degeneration"
2964,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Macular degeneration ?,"If you have macular degeneration, your eye care provider may recommend that you check your vision every day on an Amsler grid. Call your provider immediately if the lines appear wavy, or you notice any other changes in your vision."
2965,What to expect if I have Macular degeneration  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most people with mild dry macular degeneration will not have disabling central vision loss. However, there is no way to predict who will progress to a more severe form of the disease.
The wet form of macular degeneration often leads to significant vision loss.
Although macular degeneration can cause people to lose the ability to read, drive a car, and recognize faces that are not very close-up, it never causes complete blindness. This disorder results in the loss of central vision only -- macular degeneration cannot cause peripheral vision loss.
Nearly everyone with macular degeneration can move around, eat, perform personal hygiene, and do other routine activities without too much difficulty."
2966,What are the symptoms of Major depressive disorder?,"Depression can change or distort the way you see yourself, your life, and those around you.
People who have depression usually see everything with a more negative attitude, unable to imagine that any problem or situation can be solved in a positive way.
Symptoms of depression can include:
Agitation, restlessness, and irritability Dramatic change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss Very difficult to concentrate Fatigue and lack of energy Feelings of hopelessness and helplessness Feelings of worthlessness, self-hate, and guilt Becoming withdrawn or isolated Loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed
Thoughts of death or suicide
Trouble sleeping or excessive sleeping
Depression can appear as anger and discouragement, rather than feelings of sadness.
If depression is very severe, there may also be psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions."
2967,What causes Major depressive disorder?,"The exact cause of depression is not known. Many researchers believe it is caused by chemical changes in the brain. This may be due to a problem with your genes, or triggered by certain stressful events. More likely, it's a combination of both.
Some types of depression run in families. But depression can also occur if you have no family history of the illness. Anyone can develop depression, even kids.
The following may play a role in depression:
Alcohol or drug abuse Certain medical conditions, including underactive thyroid, cancer, or long-term pain Certain medications such as steroids Sleeping problems Stressful life events, such as: Breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend Failing a class Death or illness of someone close to you Divorce Childhood abuse or neglect Job loss Social isolation (common in the elderly)"
2968,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Major depressive disorder ?,"If you have thoughts of suicide or harming yourself or others, immediate call your local emergency number (such as 911) or go to the hospital emergency room.
You may also call a suicide hotline from anywhere in the United States, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week: 1-800-SUICIDE or 1-800-999-9999.
Call your doctor right away if:
You hear voices that are not there. You have frequent crying spells with little or no reason. Your depression is disrupting work, school, or family life. You think that your current medications are not working or are causing side effects. Never change or stop any medications without consulting your doctor."
2969,What to expect if I have Major depressive disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some people with major depression may feel better after taking antidepressants for a few weeks. However, many people need to take the medicine for 4 - 9 months to fully feel better and prevent the depression from returning.
For people who have repeated episodes of depression, quick and ongoing treatment may be needed to prevent more severe, long-term depression. Sometimes people will need to stay on medications for long periods of time."
2970,What are the symptoms of Malaise?,"Malaise is a symptom that can occur with almost any health condition. It may start slowly or quickly, depending on the type of disease. Fatigue (feeling tired) occurs with malaise in many diseases. Along with malaise, you can have a feeling of not having enough energy to do usual activities."
2971,What causes Malaise?,"The following lists give examples of the diseases, conditions, and medications that can cause malaise:
SHORT-TERM (ACUTE) INFECTIOUS DISEASE
Acute bronchitis or pneumonia Acute viral syndrome Infectious mononucleosis (EBV) Influenza Lyme disease
LONG-TERM (CHRONIC) INFECTIOUS DISEASE

You have other symptoms with the malaise.
Malaise lasts longer than one week, with or without other symptoms."
2973,What are the symptoms of Malaria?,"Common symptoms of malaria include:
General malaise Fever Chills Sweating Headache Nausea and vomiting Body pain Jaundice
The classically described progression of the disease, is as follows:
Cold stage - where the patient experiences a sensation of chills and shivering Hot stage - characterized by fever, headaches, and seizures, frequently experienced by children Sweating stage - characterized by sweating and exhaustion upon the return to normal temperature
Following an infective bite by the Anopheles mosquito, a period of time (the ""incubation period"") passes before the first symptoms manifest. The incubation period in most cases varies from 7 to 30 days."
2974,What causes Malaria?,"Malaria is caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. The disease may be transmitted from one human to another by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.
Four kinds of malaria parasites have long been known to infect humans:
Plasmodium falciparum P. vivax P. ovale P. malariae
P. knowlesi - a recently recognized type of malaria parasite, naturally infecting macaques in Southeast Asia as well as humans, which results in malaria transmission from animal to human (""zoonotic"" malaria).
Falciparum malaria, one of the five different types of malaria, affects a greater proportion of the red blood cells than the other types, making it significantly more serious. It can be fatal within a few hours of the manifestation of the primary symptoms.
Malaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions.
Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite is inactive over the winter.
In certain areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides and some antibiotics. This has led to difficulty in controlling both the rate of infection and subsequent spread of the disease."
2975,Who is at highest risk for Malaria ?,"Anyone is at risk to contract malaria. Most cases occur in people who live in countries where malaria is endemic. People who live in countries where malaria is not endemic, may also get the disease when they travel to such countries, or through blood transfusions. Malaria may also be transmitted from an infected mother to her infant before or during delivery.
People who are heavily exposed to the bites of mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum (causes severe and life-threatening malaria) are at the highest risk of dying from malaria. People who live in African countries south of the Sahara desert, where P. falciparum is common People who have little or no immunity to malaria, such as young children, pregnant women, and travelers coming from areas without endemic malaria Individuals in poverty who live in rural areas and lack access to health care"
2976,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Malaria ?,"Urgent medical care should be sought when:
Symptoms of malaria manifest while traveling to a country where malaria is endemic Travelers who become ill with a fever or flu -like illness, either while traveling in a malaria -risk area, or following their return home (for up to 1 year). For this reason, is essential that individuals report travel history to their health-care provider."
2977,What to expect if I have Malaria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In most cases, the prognosis of malaria is positive with prompt and proper treatment.
The prognosis of Falciparum malaria is poor due to the severity of the disease."
2978,What are the symptoms of Mallory-Weiss syndrome?,"Bloody stools
Vomiting blood (bright red)
Epigastric pain
Patients often have history of nonbloody vomiting, retching, or coughing."
2979,What causes Mallory-Weiss syndrome?,"Mallory-Weiss tears are usually developed secondary to a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure. Anything that leads to forceful and lengthy vomiting or coughing.   can cause these tears.
Mallory-Weiss tears may also be caused by convulsions."
2980,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mallory-Weiss syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you begin vomiting blood or if you pass bloody stools.
2981,What to expect if I have Mallory-Weiss syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Repeated bleeding is uncommon and the outcome is usually good. Cirrhosis of the liver and problems with blood clotting make future bleeding episodes more likely to occur.
2982,What are the symptoms of maple syrup urine disease?,Avoiding food Coma Feeding difficulties Lethargy Seizures Urine that smells like maple syrup Vomiting
2983,What causes maple syrup urine disease?,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by a gene defect. Persons with this condition cannot break down the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. This leads to a buildup of these chemicals in the blood.
In the most severe form, MSUD can damage the brain during times of physical stress (such as infection, fever, or not eating for a long time).
MSUD also occurs in an intermittent form and a mild form. Even in the mildest form, repeated periods of physical stress can cause mental retardation and high levels of leucine."
2984,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Maple syrup urine disease ?,Call your health care provider if you have a family history of MSUD and are planning to start a family. Also call immediately if you have a newborn who has symptoms of maple syrup urine disease.
2985,What to expect if I have Maple syrup urine disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"This disease can be life threatening if untreated.
Even with dietary treatment, stressful situations and illness can still cause high levels of certain amino acids. Death may occur during these episodes. With strict dietary treatment, children have grown into healthy adulthood."
2986,How common are these diseases?,"Every year, approximately 30 cases of poisoning by marine toxins are reported in the United States. Because healthcare providers are not required to report these illnesses and because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of poisonings may be much greater. Toxic seafood poisonings are more common in the summer than winter because dinoflagelates grow well in warmer seasons. It is estimated from cases with available data that one person dies every 4 years from toxic seafood poisonings.

2987,What are the symptoms of Mastitis?,"Breast enlargement on one side only Breast lump Breast pain Fever and flu-like symptoms including nausea and vomiting Itching Nipple discharge (may contain pus) Nipple sensation changes Swelling, tenderness, redness, and warmth in breast tissue Tender or enlarged lymph nodes in armpit on the same side"
2988,What causes Mastitis?,"Mastitis are usually caused by a common bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) found on normal skin. The bacteria enter through a break or crack in the skin, usually on the nipple.
The infection takes place in the fatty tissue of the breast and causes swelling. This swelling pushes on the milk ducts. The result is pain and lumps in the infected breast."
2989,Who is at highest risk for Mastitis ?,Mastitis usually occur in women who are breastfeeding. Mastitis that are not related to breastfeeding might be a rare form of breast cancer.
2990,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mastitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Any portion of the breast tissue becomes reddened, tender, swollen, or hot You are breastfeeding and develop a high fever The lymph nodes in the armpit become tender or swollen"
2991,What to expect if I have Mastitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The condition usually clears quickly with antibiotic therapy.
2992,What are the symptoms of mastoiditis?,"Mastoiditis is often difficult to detect because most children affected by this disorder do not yet have sufficient speech and language skills to tell someone what is bothering them. Common signs to look for are:
Recent episode of ear infection
Ear pain and posterior ear pain Unusual irritability Difficulty sleeping Tugging or pulling at one or both ears Fever Fluid draining from the ear Loss of balance Unresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of hearing difficulty such as sitting too close to the television or being inattentive Clumsiness and poor balance Headache Lethargy Common cold symptoms"
2993,What causes mastoiditis?,"The most common cause of mastoiditis is bacterial infection after or during middle ear infection. The causes are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus . Staphylococci, Pseudomonas species and polymicrobials present predominantly seen in non-acute mastoiditis."
2994,Who is at highest risk for Mastoiditis ?,"Risk factors for ear infections include the following:
Infants and young children Attending daycare Changes in altitude or climate Cold climate Exposure to smoke Genetic factors (susceptibility to infection may run in families) Not being breastfed Pacifier use Recent ear infection Recent illness of any type (lowers resistance of the body to infection)
Immune systems are not fully developed. Smaller and straighter eustachian tubes are more prone to clogging. Larger adenoids interfering with eustachian tube openings."
2995,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mastoiditis ?,"Call your child's doctor if:
Pain, fever, or irritability do not improve within 24 to 48 hours with antibiotic therapy At the start, the child seems sicker than just an ear infection Your child has a high fever or severe pain Severe pain suddenly stops hurting -- this may indicate a ruptured eardrum Symptoms worsen New symptoms appear, especially severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles
For a child younger than 6 months, let the doctor know right away if the child has a fever, even if no other symptoms are present."
2996,What to expect if I have Mastoiditis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, mastoiditis will result in sever complications such as intracranial extension and permanent neurological deficits or death. The consequences of mastoiditis have been reduced after introduction of antimicrobial agents and adequate therapy of acute otitis media. However mastoiditis has not been eradicated completely and may give rise to sever complications
Complications from mastoiditis, including meningitis and bone and brain abscesses (infections of the brain and bones around the skull) can lead to poor prognosis without treatment.
Untreated mastoiditis may lead to permanent hearing impairment due to persistent fluid in the middle ear reducing a child's hearing.
Children who have early hearing impairment from frequent ear infections are likely to have speech and language disabilities."
2997,What are the symptoms of Meckel's diverticulum?,"Symptoms include:
Abdominal discomfort or pain ranging from mild to severe Passing of blood in the stool
Symptoms often occur during the first few years of life, but may not start until adulthood."
2998,What are the causes of Meckel's diverticulum?,"A Meckel's diverticulum is tissue left over from structures in the unborn baby's digestive tract that were not fully reabsorbed before birth. Approximately 2% of the population has a Meckel's diverticulum, but only a few people develop symptoms."
2999,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Meckel%27s diverticulum ?,See your health care provider promptly if your child passes blood or bloody stool or complains repeatedly of abdominal discomfort.

A diet low in iodine: Clinical survey show medullary thyroid cancer are more common in areas where people's diets are low in iodine. Radiation: Scientists has proven that radiation exposure is a risk factor for follicular thyroid cancer. Such radiation includes medical treatments and radiation fallout from power plant accidents or nuclear weapons. Hereditary conditions: Studies show people with certain inherited medical conditions such as Gardner syndrome, Cowden disease, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at higher risk of developing medullary thyroid cancer Gender: Contrary to other cancers, follicular thyroid cancers occur more often in women than in men. Age: Clinical data show that papillary and follicular thyroid cancer is usually found in people between the ages of 20 and 60 years."

3015,What causes Memory loss?,"There are many areas of the brain that help you create and retrieve memories. Damage or malfunction of any of these areas can lead to memory loss.
Memory loss due to problems with specific brain areas may be different. It may involve only memory of recent or new events, passed or remote events, or both. The amnesia may be only for specific events or for all events. The problem may involve learning new information or forming new memories.
Mental or thinking abilities may still be present or may have been lost. Filling in the details with imagined events (confabulation), and disorientation to time and place may occur.
Memory loss may be for words and thoughts only, or for motor memory (the body can no longer perform specific actions). Memory loss may also be partial, meaning failing to remember only a selected group of items.
Memory loss may be short-term (called transient).
Causes of memory loss include:
Alcohol or ilicit drug intoxication An event in which not enough oxygen was going to the brain (heart stopped, stopped breathing, complications from receiving anesthesia) Brain growths (caused by tumors or infection) Brain infections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, or HIV /AIDS Brain surgery, such as surgery to treat seizure disorders Cancer treatments, such as brain radiation, bone marrow transplant, or after chemotherapy Certain medications Certain types of seizures Dementia Depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia when symptoms have not been well controlled Dissociative disorder (not being able to remember a major, traumatic event; the memory loss may be short-term or long-term) Drugs such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines Electroconvulsive therapy (especially if it is long-term) Encephalitis of any type (infection, autoimmune disease, chemical/drug induced) Epilepsy that is not well controlled with medications Head trauma or injury Heart bypass surgery Illness that results in the loss of, or damage to nerve cells (neurodegenerative illness), such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or Multiple sclerosis Long-term alcohol abuse Migraine headache Mild head injury or concussion Nutritional problems (vitamin deficiencies such as low vitamin B12) Permanent damage or injuries to the brain Transient global amnesia Transient ischemic attack (TIA)"

3018,What Causes Meningioma?,"At the moment, there are no exact causes of meningioma."
3019,Who is at highest risk for Meningioma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of meningioma is related to several factors.
Radiation treatment: Clinical data suggests that head radiation therapy increase the risk of developing meningioma.
An inherited nervous system disorder: Studies show the disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 increases the risk of meningioma and other brain tumors.
Female hormones: As a tumor common in women than men, doctors believe that female hormones may play an important role in developing meningioma."
3020,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Meningioma ?,"A meningioma doesn't always require immediate treatment. And a small, slow-growing meningioma without any signs or symptoms may not require treatment. But call your health care provider if symptoms of meningioma developes."
3021,What to expect if I have Meningioma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of meningioma depends on the extent of the resection during surgery and the histological grade of the tumor.

Virus: Mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex viruses, varicella-zoster virus. Fungi: Patinets at higher risk of fungal meningitis include those who have AIDS, leukemia, or other forms of immunodeficient diseases and immunosuppression. Cryptococcus is the most common fungi for these patients. Other fungi caused meningitis include histoplasma and coccidioides. Brain tumor Brain surgery Head injury Systemic lupus erythematosus (Lupus)"
3024,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Meningitis ?,"If you or your child experience either of the symptoms of meningitis, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible."
3025,What to expect if I have Meningitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of meningitis depends on:
Whether the patient is diagnosed and treated early. The origin of the infection: Viral meningitis is usually not serious, and symptoms will disappear within two weeks. The patient's general condition: The prognosis of patients who have AIDS, leukemia, or other forms of immunodeficient diseases and immunosuppression is poor."
3026,What are the symptoms of Menkes disease?,"Bone spurs Brittle, kinky hair Feeding difficulties Irritability Lack of muscle tone, floppiness (hypotonia) Low body temperature Mental deterioration Pudgy, rosy cheeks Seizures Skeletal changes"
3027,What causes Menkes disease?,"Menkes syndrome is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to distribute and absorb copper. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper.
Low copper levels can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels and interfere with nerve function. Copper also builds up in the small intestine and kidneys.
Menkes syndrome is inherited, which means it runs in families."
3028,Who is at risk for Menkes disease?,"Menkes disease is a genetic disorder, so anyone with a family history of the disease is at risk."
3029,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Menkes disease ?,Talk to your health care provider if you have a family history of Menkes syndrome and you plan to have children. A baby with this condition will often show symptoms early in infancy.
3030,What to expect if I have Menkes disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most persons with this condition die within the first few years of life.
3031,What are the symptoms of Menopause?,"In some women, menstrual flow comes to a sudden halt. More commonly, it slowly stops over time. During this time, the menstrual periods generally become either more closely or more widely spaced. This irregularity may last for 1 - 3 years before menstruation finally ends completely. Before this, the cycle length may shorten to as little as every 3 weeks.
Common symptoms of menopause include:
Heart pounding or racing Hot flashes Headach Night sweats Skin flushing Sleep disturbance (insomnia) Irregular bleeding
Other symptoms of menopause may include:
Decreased interest in sex, possibly decreased response to sexual stimulation Forgetfulness (in some women) Headaches Irregular menstrual periods Mood swings including irritability, depression, and anxiety Urine leakage Vaginal dryness and painful sexual intercourse Vaginal infections Joint aches (joint pains) Irregular heartbeat (palpitations) Pain, discomfort, or burning sensation when passing urine. Increased frequency of urination muscle pain Back pain Loss of concentration"
3032,What causes Menopause?,"Menopause is a natural event that normally occurs between the ages of 45 and 55.
Once menopause is complete (called postmenopause) and you have not had a period for 1 year, you are no longer at risk of becoming pregnant.
The symptoms of menopause are caused by changes in estrogen and progesterone levels. The ovaries make less of these hormones over time. The specific symptoms and how significant (mild, moderate, or severe) they vary from woman to woman.
A gradual decrease of estrogen generally allows your body to slowly adjust to the hormonal changes. Hot flashes and sweats are at their worst for the first 1 - 2 years after the last period. Menopause symptoms may last 5 or more years.
Estrogen levels may drop suddenly after some medical treatments, as is seen when the ovaries are removed surgically (called surgical menopause). Chemotherapy and anti-estrogen treatment for breast cancer are other examples. Symptoms can be more severe and start more suddenly in these circumstances.
As a result of the fall in hormone levels, changes occur in the entire female reproductive system. The vaginal walls become less elastic and thinner. The vagina becomes shorter(vaginal atrophy). Lubricating secretions from the vagina become watery. The outside genital tissue thins. This is called atrophy of the labia."
3033,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Menopause ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You are spotting blood between periods You have had 12 consecutive months with no period and suddenly vaginal bleeding or spotting begins again, even if it is a very small amount"
3034,What causes Menorrhagia?,"A change in hormone levels is a common cause of abnormal menstrual bleeding. This is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
Other causes of abnormal menstrual bleeding include:
Endometrial hyperplasia (thickening/build-up of the lining of the uterus) Cancer of the uterus Uterine fibroids, uterine polyps (small noncancerous growths in the lining of the uterus), adenomyosis Medical conditions such as thyroid and pituitary disorders, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, and systemic lupus erythematosus Pregnancy complications such as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus) Changes in birth control pills or estrogens that you take Use of certain drugs such as steroids or blood thinners (for example, warfarin or Coumadin) Use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control Recent trauma, surgery, or other uterine procedure Infection in the uterus (pelvic inflammatory disease) Bleeding disorders such as Von Willebrand disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Stress, change in diet or exercise routine, recent weight loss or weight gain, travel, or illness"
3035,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Menorrhagia ?,"Call your doctor if:
You have soaked through a pad or tampon every hour for 2 - 3 hours. Your bleeding has lasted longer than 1 week. You are pregnant or could be pregnant. You have severe pain, especially if you also have pain when not menstruating. Your periods have been heavy or prolonged for three or more cycles, compared to what is normal for you. You have a fever or abnormal vaginal discharge, especially if it has an odor. You have bleeding or spotting after menopause. You have bleeding or spotting between periods. You have nipple discharge, excessive hair growth, deepening voice, unintentional weight loss or gain, or new acne."
3036,What are the symptoms of Mental retardation?,"Continued infant-like behavior Decreased learning ability Failure to meet the markers of intellectual development Inability to meet educational demands at school Lack of curiosity
Note: Changes to normal behaviors depend on the severity of the condition. Mild retardation may be associated with a lack of curiosity and quiet behavior. Severe mental retardation is associated with infant-like behavior throughout life."
3037,What causes Mental retardation?,"Mental retardation affects about 1 - 3% of the population. There are many causes of mental retardation, but doctors find a specific reason in only 25% of cases.
A family may suspect mental retardation if the child's motor skills, language skills, and self-help skills do not seem to be developing, or are developing at a far slower rate than the child's peers.
Failure to adapt (adjust to new situations) normally and grow intellectually may become apparent early in a child's life. In the case of mild retardation, these failures may not become recognizable until school age or later.
The degree of impairment from mental retardation varies widely, from profoundly impaired to mild or borderline retardation. Less emphasis is now placed on the degree of retardation and more on the amount of intervention and care needed for daily life.
Causes of mental retardation can be roughly broken down into several categories:
Infections (present at birth or occurring after birth): Congenital Cytomegalovirus Congenital rubella syndrome Congenital toxoplasmosis Encephalitis HIV infection Listeriosis Meningitis
Chromosomal abnormalities: Chromosome deletions (such as cri du chat syndrome Chromosomal translocations (a gene is located in an unusual spot on a chromosome, or located on a different chromosome than usual) Defects in the chromosome or chromosomal inheritance (such as fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome) Errors of chromosome numbers (such as Down syndrome)
Environmental: Deprivation syndrome
Genetic abnormalities and inherited metabolic disorders: Adrenoleukodystrophy Galactosemia Hunter syndrome Hurler syndrome Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Phenylketonuria Rett syndrome Sanfilippo syndrome Tay-Sachs disease Tuberous sclerosis
Metabolic: Congenital hypothyroidism Hypoglycemia (poorly regulated diabetes) Reye syndrome Hyperbilirubinemia (very high bilirubin levels in babies)
Nutritional: Malnutrition
Toxic: Intrauterine exposure to alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs Lead poisoning Methylmercury poisoning
Trauma (before and after birth): Intracranial hemorrhage before or after birth Lack of oxygen to the brain before, during, or after birth Severe head injury
Unexplained (this largest category is for unexplained occurrences of mental retardation)"
3038,Who is at highest risk for Mental retardation ?,Risk factors are related to the causes.
3039,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mental retardation ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have any concerns about your child's development You notice that your child's motor or language skills are not developing normally Your child has other disorders that need treatment"
3040,What to expect if I have Mental retardation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on:
Opportunities Other conditions Personal motivation Treatment
Many people lead productive lives and function on their own; others need a structured environment to be most successful."
3041,What are the symptoms of Mesothelioma?,"Early mesothelioma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the symptoms.
Mesothelioma that affects the pleura can cause:
Chest pain Shortness of breath Cough Blood in sputum or hemoptysis Fever Sweating Fatigue Weight loss Trouble swallowing
Mesothelioma that affects the peritoneum can cause:
Abdominal pain Ascites or abdominal distension A mass in the abdomen Problems with bowel function Fatigue Weight loss
Mesothelioma that affects the pericardium can cause:
Palpitation Cough or hemoptysis dizziness or hypotension oedema in legs Fatigue
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3042,What causes Mesothelioma?,"Long-term exposure to asbestos -- a fire-resistant material -- is the biggest risk factor. Asbestos was once commonly found in insulation, ceiling and roofing vinyls, cement, and automotive brake materials. Although many asbestos workers smoked, experts do not believe smoking itself is a cause of this condition.
Malignant mesothelioma affects men more often than women. The average age at diagnosis is 60."
3043,Who is at highest risk for Mesothelioma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of kidney cancer is related to several factors.
Asbestos: Doctors found most cases of mesothelioma have been linked to asbestos exposure in the workplace. Zeolites: Zeolites are silicate minerals chemically related to asbestos. Data suggest that they are related to the development of mesothelioma. Radiation: During the past, thorotrast is found to invlove in the development of mesothelioma. Simian virus 40 (SV40): Some lab studies reported that SV40 infection may cause mesothelioma."
3044,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mesothelioma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of mesothelioma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe chest pain A large amount of hemoptysis Shortness of breath Severe abdominal pain Abdominal distension Palpitation Hypotension, even shock"
3045,What to expect if I have Mesothelioma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In general, the prognosis of mesothelioma is poor and it depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread The patient’s general health"
3046,What are the symptoms of Methemoglobinemia?,"Symptoms of type 1 methemoglobinemia (erythrocyte reductase deficiency) include:

Developmental delay Failure to thrive Intellectual disability Seizures
Symptoms of hemoglobin M disease include:
Bluish coloring of the skin
Symptoms of acquired methemoglobinemia include:
Bluish coloring of the skin Headache Fatigue Shortness of breath Lack of energy"
3047,What causes Methemoglobinemia?,"This condition can be passed down through families (inherited or congenital). Or, it is caused by exposure to certain drugs, chemicals, or foods (acquired).
There are two forms of inherited methemoglobinemia. The first form is passed on by both parents. The parents usually do not have the condition themselves, but they carry the gene that causes the condition. It occurs when there is a problem with an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase.
There are two types of this form of methemoglobinemia:
Type 1 (also called erythrocyte reductase deficiency) occurs when red blood cells lack the enzyme. Type 2 (also called generalized reductase deficiency) occurs when the enzyme doesn't work anywhere in the body.
The second form of inherited methemoglobinemia is called hemoglobin M disease. It is caused by defects in the hemoglobin protein itself. Only one parent needs to pass on the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease.
Acquired methemoglobinemia is more common than the inherited forms. It occurs in some people after they are exposed to certain chemicals and drugs, including:
Anesthetics such as benzocaine Benzene Certain antibiotics (including dapsone and chloroquine) Nitrites (used as additives to prevent meat from spoiling)
The condition may also occur in infants who are very ill or who are fed too many vegetables containing nitrates (such as beets)."
3048,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Methemoglobinemia ?,"Call your health care provider if you have a family history of methemoglobinemia and you develop symptoms of this disorder.
Call your health care provider or emergency services (911) immediately if you have severe shortness of breath."
3049,What to expect if I have Methemoglobinemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with type 1 methemoglobinemia and hemoglobin M disease usually do well. Type 2 methemoglobinemia is much more serious, and usually causes death within the first few years of life.
People with acquired methemoglobinemia usually do very well once the drug, food, or chemical that caused the problem is identified and avoided."
3050,What causes Metrorrhagia?,"Uterine fibroids or cervical or uterine polyps Changes in hormone levels Inflammation or infection of the cervix (cervicitis) Injury or disease of the vaginal opening (caused by intercourse, infection, polyp, genital warts, ulcer, or varicose veins) IUD use (may cause occasional spotting) Ectopic pregnancy Miscarriage Other pregnancy complications Vaginal dryness due to lack of estrogen after menopause Stress Stopping and starting birth control pills or estrogens Underactive thyroid (low thyroid function) Use of blood thinners (anticoagulants) Cancer or precancer of the cervix, uterus, or (very rarely) fallopian tube Cervical or endometrial biopsy or other procedures"

3054,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ?,It is a medical emergency. Any patients presenting with high clinical suspicion should be given immediate treatment.
3055,What causes Microcephaly?,"Microcephaly most often occurs because the brain fails to grow at a normal rate. Skull growth is determined by brain growth. Brain growth takes place while in the womb and during infancy.
Conditions that affect brain growth can cause microcephaly. These include infections, genetic disorders, and severe malnutrition.
Genetic conditions that cause microcephaly include: Cornelia de Lange syndrome Cri du chat syndrome Down syndrome Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome Seckel syndrome Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome Trisomy 18 Trisomy 21 These additional conditions may indirectly cause microcephaly: Uncontrolled phenylketonuria in the mother Methylmercury poisoning Congenital rubella Congenital toxoplasmosis Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) Use of certain drugs during pregnancy, especially alcohol and phenytoin"
3056,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Microcephaly ?,"Microcephaly is often diagnosed at birth or during routine well-baby examinations when the infant's height, weight, and head circumference is measured. If you suspect your infant's head size is too small or not growing normally, consult your health care provider"
3057,What are the Symptoms of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection?,"Most people who got infected with MERS-CoV developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some people were reported as initially having a mild respiratory illness."
3058,What Causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection?,"MERS is caused by a coronavirus called “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus” (MERS-CoV).
MERS-CoV has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact. Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed. Clusters of cases in several countries are being investigated.
We don’t know for certain where the virus came from. However, it likely came from an animal source. In addition to humans, MERS-CoV has been found in camels in Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and a bat in Saudi Arabia. Camels in a few other countries have also tested positive for antibodies to MERS-CoV, indicating they were previously infected with MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. However, we don’t know whether camels are the source of the virus. More information is needed to identify the possible role that camels, bats, and other animals may play in the transmission of MERS-CoV."
3059,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection ?,"If you develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after traveling from countries in the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries, you should see your healthcare provider and mention your recent travel."
3060,What to expect if I have Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Approximately 30% of patients infected with MERS-CoV died.
3061,What are the symptoms of Migraine?,"Patients may experience the following symptoms after the trigger.
Headache: Headache caused by migraine is ususally described as moderate to severe, intense, throbbing or pounding pain which may be confined to one side or may affect both sides of the head. Headache of migraine usually is aggravated by regular activities. Nausea with or without vomiting Sensitivity to light and sound Cold hands and cold feet"
3062,Who is at highest risk for Migraine ?,"The cause of migraine remains unknown. It seems that both genetics and environmental contribute to the cause. The following factors make you more prone to having migraines.
A family history of migraines Younger than 40 Female Hormonal changes: For female patients with migraines, the trigger is associated with menstruation cycle. They may also change during pregnancy or menopause.
Many individuals with migraine can identify triggers that cause or aggravate the headache. Avoiding triggers may be helpful to decrease the frequency or severity of migraine. Some triggers include:
Anxiety Stress Food: Some migraines can be triggered by certain foods, including beer and red wine, aged cheeses, chocolate, aspartame, caffeine, monosodium glutamate, salty foods, and processed foods. Changes in the weather Lack of sleep or too much sleep Sensory stimuli, including bright lights, sun glare, loud sounds, unusual smells such as perfume, paint thinner and secondhand smoke, can also trigger migraines. Hormonal changes in women, during menstruation cycle, pregnancy or menopause."

Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Abdominal swelling Chills Joint pain Pale skin due to anemia (pallor) Swollen glands
Note: The symptoms will depend upon the affected areas of the body."
3066,What causes Miliary tuberculosis?,"Tuberculosis (TB) infection can develop after inhaling droplets sprayed into the air from a cough or sneeze by someone infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Small areas of infection, called granulomas (granular tumors), develop in the lungs.
The usual site of TB is the lungs, but other organs can be involved. In the U.S., most people with primary tuberculous get better and have no further evidence of disease. Disseminated TB develops in the small number of infected people whose immune systems do not successfully contain the primary infection.
Disseminated disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it does not occur until years after you become infected. You are more likely to get this type of TB if you have a weaken immune system due to disease (such as AIDS) or certain medications. Infants and the elderly are also at higher risk.
Your risk for catching TB increases if you:
Are around people who have the disease
Live in crowded or unclean conditions
Have poor nutrition
TB has become more common in the U.S. in recent years. This may be due to a larger number of TB infections in people with AIDS and HIV, an increase in the number of immune-suppressing medications, and increasing numbers of homeless people. A rise in drug-resistant strains of TB bacteria also plays a role."
3067,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Miliary tuberculosis ?,Call your health care provider if you know or suspect that you have been exposed to TB. All forms of TB and exposure need prompt evaluation and treatment.

One-sided Typically lasting minutes to a few hours, possibly as long as 24-48 hours Usually sharp, cramping, distinctive pain Severe (rare) May switch sides from month to month or from one episode to another Begins midway through the menstrual cycle"
3070,What causes Mittelschmerz?,"About 1 in 5 women have mittelschmerz, or pain associated with ovulation. The pain may occur just before, during, or after ovulation.
There are several explanations for the cause of this pain.
Just prior to ovulation: follicle growth may stretch the surface of the ovary, causing pain. At the time of ovulation: fluid or blood is released from the ruptured egg follicle and may cause irritation of the abdominal lining."
3071,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mittelschmerz ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if ovulation pain seems to change, lasts longer than usual, or occurs with vaginal bleeding."
3072,What to expect if I have Mittelschmerz  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Mittelschmerz can be painful, but it is not harmful. It is not a sign of disease.

The rash may appears genital area (perianal, scrotum and lining of the penis) but also in any part of the body in a form of multiple raised nodules that evolve with the formation of a central crust. Within 2-4 weeks, the rash resolves by scabbing over."
3074,What causes Monkeypox?,"Monkeypox is caused monkeypox virus, a virus that was first discovered in 1958. The first human reported case was in 1970.
Animal-to-human: The virus can be acquired through exposure to an infected animal through invasive bite or scratch, or through direct contact with lesions or bodily fluids.

Cases are almost never fatal."
3079,What causes Mononucleosis?,"Infectious mononucleosis is spread through immediate contact with saliva, hence the colloquial name ""kissing disease"". Sharing eating utensils is another way to transmit mononucleosis.
Contact through air or blood does not spread mononucleosis.
Even long after having been exposed to the virus and any acute symptoms are gone, people still carry the virus. They are typically not at risk of reinfection but are at risk of infecting others. Because so many people have been infected with the virus, prevention from exposure is near impossible."
3080,Who is at highest risk for Mononucleosis ?,"Mononucleosis is a very prevalent viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, a herpes virus.
90% of adults have been exposed to the mononucleosis, many as little children, when no symptoms or flu-like symptoms are exhibited.
In underdeveloped countries, almost everyone is exposed at a very young age, so mononucleosis exists mostly in developed countries."

3082,What to expect if I have Mononucleosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The fever usually drops in 10 days, and swollen lymph glands and spleen heal in 4 weeks. Fatigue usually goes away within a few weeks, but may linger for 2 to 3 months."
3083,What are the symptoms of Morning sickness?,"Morning sickness is very common.
Most pregnant women have at least some nausea, and about a third have vomiting.
Morning sickness usually begins during the first month of pregnancy and continues through the 14th to 16th week (3rd or 4th month). Some women have nausea and vomiting through their entire pregnancy.
Morning sickness does not hurt the baby in any way unless you lose weight, such as with severe vomiting. The amount of morning sickness during one pregnancy does not predict how you will feel in future pregnancies."
3084,What causes Morning sickness?,"The exact cause of morning sickness is unknown.

3090,Who is at highest risk for Motion sickness ?,"All people, given sufficient stimulus, will develop motion sickness, although some groups are at higher risk:
Children aged 2–12 years are especially susceptible, but infants and toddlers seem relatively immune. Women, especially when pregnant, menstruating, or on hormones, are more likely to have motion sickness. People who get migraine headaches are prone to motion sickness during a migraine and prone to getting a migraine while they are experiencing motion sickness. People who expect to be sick are likely to experience symptoms."

Coughing Chest pain Coughing up blood
Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body will depend on the affected area."
3104,What Causes Multi-Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis?,"Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to anti- TB drugs. This resistance can occur when drugs are misused or mismanaged: 
When patients do not complete their full course of treatment When health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or length of time for taking the drugs When the supply of drugs is not always available When the drugs are of poor quality"
3105,Who is at highest risk for Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis ?,"Drug resistance is more common in people who: 
Do not take their TB medicine regularly Do not take all of their TB medicine as told by their doctor or nurse Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease
Tuberculosis bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. 
These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these bacteria can become infected."
3106,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis ?,"Urgent medical care should be sought:
If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or TB blood test. You should also inform your doctor or nurse when did this contact occur.  When you experience some of the previously described symptoms."
3107,Where to Find Medical Care for Multi-Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Tuberculosis
3108,What to expect if I have Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of multidrug-resistant TB is worst than that of tuberculosis susceptible to common treatment. Therefore it is mandatory to perform a drug susceptibility test and to monitor adherence to the treatment regimen, in order to avoid new drug resistances and ensure a better outcome."
3109,What are the symptoms of Multi-infarct dementia?,"Symptoms may develop gradually or may progress after each small stroke.
The symptoms of the disorder may begin suddenly after each stroke. Some peole with MID may appear to improve for short periods of time, then decline after having more silent strokes.
The early symptoms of dementia can include:
Difficulty performing tasks that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines Getting lost on familiar routes Language problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects Losing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat mood Misplacing items Personality changes and loss of social skills
As the dementia becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of yourself. The symptoms may include:
Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you are Having delusions, depression, agitation Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, violent behavior Having more difficulty reading or writing Having poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact
Any of the neurologic problems that occur with a stroke may also be present."
3110,What causes Multi-infarct dementia?,"Multi-infarct dementia (MID) is the second most common cause of dementia (after Alzheimer's disease) in people over age 65. MID affects men more often than women. The disorder usually affects people between ages 55 and 75.
MID is caused by a series of small strokes.
A stroke is an interruption in or blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is sometimes called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that many areas in the brain have been injured due to a lack of blood. If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage. When these strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms of a stroke. These are often called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of MID begin to appear. Not all strokes need to be ""silent."" Larger strokes that have clear affects on strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function also can lead to MID."
3111,Who is at highest risk for Multi-infarct dementia ?,"Risk factors for MID include a history of:
Diabetes Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) High blood pressure (hypertension) Smoking Stroke
Symptoms of dementia in any one person may be caused by either Alzheimer's disease or MID. The symptoms for each problem are very similar, and MID may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease."
3112,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Multi-infarct dementia ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of vascular dementia occur.
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if there is a sudden change in mental status. This is an emergency symptom of stroke."
3113,What to expect if I have Multi-infarct dementia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some improvement may occur for short periods of time, but the disorder will generally get worse over time."
3114,What are the symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia?,"Symptoms vary from person to person, and depend on which gland is involved. They may include:

3115,What causes multiple endocrine neoplasia?,"MEN I is caused by a defect in a gene that carries the code for a protein called menin. The condition causes tumors of various glands to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time. The disorder may occur at any age, and it affects men and women equally. A family history of this disorder raises your risk."
3116,Who is at highest risk for Multiple endocrine neoplasia ?,The most potent risk factor in the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia is family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia.
3117,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Multiple endocrine neoplasia ?,Call your health care provider if you notice symptoms of MEN I or have a family history of this condition.
3118,What to expect if I have Multiple endocrine neoplasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Pituitary and parathyroid tumors are usually noncancerous (benign), but some pancreatic tumors may become cancerous (malignant) and spread to the liver. These can lower life expectancy. The symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, low blood sugar, excess calcium in the blood, and pituitary dysfunction usually respond well to appropriate treatment."
3119,What are the symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1?,Visual disturbance Headache Constipation Nausea Vomiting Dehydration Lethargy Depression Confusion Anorexia
3120,What causes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1?,"MEN1 is an inherited disorder that causes tumors in the endocrine glands and the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Genetic mutations is speculated to be the cause of the disease."

3129,What are the symptoms of Munchausen syndrome?,"A person with Munchausen syndrome gains intense satisfaction from the attention associated with playing the ill patient or victim. Signs and symptoms that may suggest Munchausen syndrome include:
A spectacular medical history that includes a large number of tests, medical procedures and operations Odd collection of seemingly unrelated symptoms No conclusive results despite intense medical investigations New symptoms that appear after medical tests prove negative Extensive medical knowledge of many different illnesses Frequenting many different doctors, sometimes in other states Frequent presentation at emergency departments, usually at different hospitals Requests for invasive medical procedures or surgeries Failure to improve despite medical treatment, including relapsing for unknown reasons."
3130,Who is at highest risk for Munchausen syndrome ?,"Risk factors may include:
Chronic illness during childhood – the person may have received a lot of attention because of their illness Chronic illness of a significant family member when the person was a child Self-esteem or identity problems Relationship problems Difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy Ability to lie and manipulate A history of mental problems such as depression, hallucinations or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) The need to blame personal failures on external factors, such as illness."
3131,What to expect if I have Munchausen syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Recovery is slow or non-existent.
3132,What are the symptoms of Munchausen syndrome by proxy?,"The child's symptoms do not fit a classical picture of illness or do not fit together well. The child's symptoms improve at the hospital but reappear at home. The parent is overattentive or ""too helpful."" The parent is often involved in a health-care field, such as nursing."
3133,What causes Munchausen syndrome by proxy?,"This syndrome almost always involves a mother abusing her child by seeking unneeded medical attention for the child. It is rare and poorly understood. The cause is unknown.
The mother may fake symptoms of illness in her child by adding blood to the child's urine or stool, withholding food, falsifying fevers, secretly giving the child drugs to make the child throw up or have diarrhea, or using other tricks, such as infecting intravenous (given through a vein) lines to make the child appear or become ill.
These children are often hospitalized with groups of symptoms that don't quite fit any known disease. Frequently, the children are made to suffer through unnecessary tests, surgeries, or other uncomfortable procedures.
The parent is usually very helpful in the hospital setting and is often appreciated by the nursing staff for the care she gives her child. She is often seen as devoted and self-sacrificing, which can make medical professionals unlikely to suspect the diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
Her frequent visits unfortunately also make the child accessible to her so that she can induce further symptoms. Changes in the child's condition are almost never witnessed by hospital staff and almost always occur only in the mother's presence.
Munchausen syndrome occurs because of psychological problems in the adult, and is generally an attention-seeking behavior. The syndrome can be life-threatening for the child involved."
3134,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Munchausen syndrome by proxy ?,"This condition is diagnosed by the health care provider when the child is treated for various symptoms.
If you find that you have urges to harm your child, seek psychiatric care immediately."
3135,What to expect if I have Munchausen syndrome by proxy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"This is a difficult disorder to treat in parents. There is little information available about the best types of treatment or what the outcome will be. It usually requires years of psychiatric support.
Children may require medical care to treat injuries the parent inflicted, as well as psychiatric care to deal with depression, anxiety, and other conditions that can be provoked by child abuse.
Some children may die from infections or other injuries inflicted by parents with Munchausen syndrome by proxy."
3136,What are the symptoms of Muscle weakness?,Inability to carry out normal daily activities

3139,What are the symptoms of Mycobacterium abscessus infection?,"Skin infected with M. abscessus is usually red, warm, tender to the touch, swollen, and/or painful. Infected areas can also develop boils or pus-filled vesicles. Other signs of M. abscessus infection are fever, chills, muscle aches, and a general feeling of illness. However, for a definite diagnosis, the organism has to be cultured from the infection site or, in severe cases, from a blood culture. A medical provider should evaluate the infection to determine if it may be due to M. abscessus."
3140,What causes Mycobacterium abscessus infection?,"Mycobacterium abscessus is a bacterium distantly related to the ones that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. It is part of a group known as rapidly growing mycobacteria and is found in water, soil, and dust. It has been known to contaminate medications and products, including medical devices."
3141,Who is at highest risk for Mycobacterium abscessus ?,"People with open wounds or who receive injections without appropriate skin disinfection may be at risk for infection by M. abscessus. Rarely, individuals with underlying respiratory conditions or impaired immune systems are at risk of lung infection."
3142,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mycobacterium abscessus ?,Patients should seek urgent medical care when they have rapidly progressive symptoms.
3143,What to expect if I have Mycobacterium abscessus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Minor infections with M. abscessus can resolve either spontaneously or following surgical debridement.  The majority of pulmonary M. abscessus infection are chronic and incurable. When pulmonary M. abscessus infection occurs in the absence of any predisposing conditions, the course of the disease is slowly progressive and indolent. Whereas, when the pulmonary infection is associated with underlying predisposing factors, such as gastrointestinal or pulmonary conditions, the disease is rapidly progressive and fulminant."
3144,What are the symptoms of mycoplasma pneumonia?,"The symptoms are generally mild and appear over a period of 1 to 3 weeks. They may become more severe in some people.
Common symptoms include the following:

Less common symptoms include:
Ear pain Eye pain or soreness Muscle aches and joint stiffness Neck lump Rapid breathing Skin lesions or rash"
3145,What causes mycoplasma pneumonia?,"Mycoplasma pneumonia is a type of atypical pneumonia. It is caused by the bacteria M. pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia usually affects people younger than 40. Various studies suggest that it makes up 15 - 50% of all pneumonia cases in adults and even more in school-aged children.
People at highest risk for mycoplasma pneumonia include those living or working in crowded areas such as schools and homeless shelters, although many people who contract mycoplasma pneumonia have no identifiable risk factor."
3146,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mycoplasma pneumonia ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. While there are numerous causes for these symptoms, you will need to be checked for pneumonia.
Also, call if you have been diagnosed with this type of pneumonia and your symptoms become worse."
3147,What to expect if I have Mycoplasma pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most people recover completely even without antibiotics, although antibiotics may speed recovery. In untreated adults, cough and weakness can persist for up to a month."
3148,What are the symptoms of Myelofibrosis?,Abdominal fullness related to an enlarged spleen Bone pain Bruising Easy bleeding Fatigue Increased likelihood of getting an infection Pallor Shortness of breath with exercise Weight loss Loss of appetite Night sweats Fever Early satiety Bleeding Peripheral swelling Frequent infections Dry cough Skin nodules Itchy skin
3149,What causes Myelofibrosis?,"Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all of your blood cells. Your blood is made up of:
Red blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues) White blood cells (which fight infection) Platelets (which help your blood clot)
Scarring of the bone marrow means the marrow is not able to make enough blood cells. Anemia, bleeding problems, and a higher risk of infections may develop as a result.
The liver and spleen may try to compensate and make some of these blood cells, a process called'extramedullary hematopoiesis'. This causes these organs to swell.
The disorder usually develops slowly in people over age 50.
Diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis."
3150,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Myelofibrosis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms of this disorder develop. Uncontrolled bleeding, shortness of breath, or jaundice that gets worse, need urgent or emergency care."
3151,What to expect if I have Myelofibrosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"This disorder causes slowly worsening bone marrow failure with severe anemia. Low platelet count leads to easy bleeding. Spleen swelling may slowly get worse.
The average survival of people with primary myelofibrosis is about 5 years. However, some people may survive for decades."
3152,What are the Symptoms of (Disease name)?,"Fever or frequent infections. Shortness of breath. Feeling very tired and weak. Pale skin. Easy bruising or bleeding. Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding). Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs"

3156,What are the symptoms of Myotonia congenita?,"The hallmark of this condition is the myotonia -- the inability of the muscle to quickly relax after contracting. For example, after a handshake, the person is only very slowly able to open and pull away his hand.
Early symptoms may include:
Difficulty in swallowing Gagging Stiff movements that improve when they are repeated Shortness of breath or tightening of the chest at the beginning of exercise
Children with myotonia congenita often appear to be muscular and well-developed. The child may not have symptoms of myotonia congenita until age 2 or 3."
3157,What causes Myotonia congenita?,"Myotonia congenita is caused by a change (mutation) to a gene. It is passed down from either one or both parents to the children (inherited).
Myotonia congenita is believed to be caused by a problem in the part of the muscle cells that are needed for muscles to relax. Abnormal repeated electrical discharges occur in the muscles, causing a stiffness called myotonia."
3158,Who is at highest risk for Myotonia congenita ?,"People with a family history of myotonia congenita are at risk, as the condition is genetic."
3159,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Myotonia congenita ?,Call your health care provider if your child has symptoms of myotonia congenita.
3160,What to expect if I have Myotonia congenita  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People can do well with this condition. Symptoms only occur when a movement is first started. After a few repetitions, the muscle relaxes and the movement becomes normal. Symptoms may improve later in life."
3161,What are the symptoms of Ménière's disease?,"Symptoms include:
Abnormal sensations of movement (vertigo) Gets worse with sudden movement Lasts for a few minutes to several hours, may come and go Dizziness Hearing loss in one or both ears Low frequency noises lost first Extent of hearing loss may change Noises or ringing in the ear (tinnitus) Sudden episodes of complete disorientation that causes the person to fall down Sweating (may be heavy) Uncontrollable eye movements Vomiting and nausea The feeling of dizziness and being off balance generally come in attacks that last from minutes to hours. Other symptoms can last for longer.
The symptoms of Ménière's disease occur suddenly and can arise daily or as infrequently as once a year. Vertigo, often the most debilitating symptom of Ménière's disease, typically involves a whirling dizziness that forces the sufferer to lie down. Vertigo attacks can lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and sweating and often come with little or no warning.
Some individuals with Ménière's disease have attacks that start with tinnitus (ear noises), a loss of hearing, or a full feeling or pressure in the affected ear. It is important to remember that all of these symptoms are unpredictable. Typically, the attack is characterized by a combination of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss lasting several hours. People experience these discomforts at varying frequencies, durations, and intensities. Some may feel slight vertigo a few times a year. Others may be occasionally disturbed by intense, uncontrollable tinnitus while sleeping. Ménière's disease sufferers may also notice a hearing loss and feel unsteady all day long for prolonged periods. Other occasional symptoms of Ménière's disease include headaches, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. A person's hearing tends to recover between attacks but over time becomes worse."
3162,What causes Ménière's disease?,"The symptoms of Ménière's disease are associated with a change in fluid volume within the fluid-filled tubes of the inner ear. These tubes are called semicircular canals, or labyrinths, and, along with a nerve in your skull, help interpret your body's position and maintain your balance. The labyrinth has two parts: the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth, which is encased by bone, is necessary for hearing and balance and is filled with a fluid called endolymph. When your head moves, endolymph moves, causing nerve receptors in the membranous labyrinth to send signals to the brain about the body's motion. An increase in endolymph, however, can cause the membranous labyrinth to balloon or dilate, a condition known as endolymphatic hydrops.
Meniere's disease occurs when a part of the canal, called the endolymphatic sac, becomes swollen. This sac helps filter and remove fluid in the semicircular canals.
The exact cause of Meniere's disease is unknown. In some cases, it may be related to:
Head injury Middle ear infection Syphilis
Other risk factors include:
Allergies Alcohol use Fatigue Recent viral illness Respiratory infection Smoking Stress Use of certain medications, including aspirin
Genetics may also play a role.
Many experts on Ménière's disease think that a rupture of the membranous labyrinth allows the endolymph to mix with perilymph, another inner ear fluid that occupies the space between the membranous labyrinth and the bony inner ear. This mixing, scientists believe, can cause the symptoms of Ménière's disease. Scientists are investigating several possible causes of the disease, including environmental factors, such as noise pollution and viral infections, as well as biological factors."

3166,What are the symptoms of Nabothian cyst?,"Each nabothian cyst appears as a small, white raised bump. There can be more than one."
3167,What causes Nabothian cyst?,"The cervix is lined with glands and cells that release mucus. The glands can become covered by a type of skin cells called squamous epithelium. When this happens, the secretions build up in the plugged glands. They form a smooth, rounded bump on the cervix. The bump is called a nabothian cyst."
3168,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nabothian cyst ?,This condition is usually discovered during a routine pelvic examination.
3169,What to expect if I have Nabothian cyst  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Nabothian cysts do not cause any harm. They are a benign condition.
3170,What are the symptoms of Naegleria infection?,"Naegleria fowleri causes the disease primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a brain infection that leads to the destruction of brain tissue. In its early stages, symptoms of PAM may be similar to symptoms of bacterial meningitis.
Initial symptoms of PAM start about 5 days (range 1 to 7 days) after infection. The initial symptoms may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within about 5 days (range 1 to 12 days)."
3171,What causes Naegleria infection?,Only one species (type) of Naegleria infects people: Naegleria fowleri.
3172,Who is at highest risk for Naegleria infection ?,"Naegleria fowleri is found around the world. In the United States, the majority of infections have been caused by Naegleria fowleri from warm freshwater located in southern-tier states. The ameba can be found in:
Factors that can increase your risk of meningitis include: Bodies of warm freshwater, such as lakes and rivers Geothermal (naturally hot) water, such as hot springs Warm water discharge from industrial plants Geothermal (naturally hot) drinking water sources Soil Swimming pools that are poorly maintained, minimally-chlorinated, and/or un-chlorinated Water heaters with temperatures less than 47°C
Naegleria fowleri is not found in salt water, like the ocean"

React to criticism with rage, shame, or humiliation Take advantage of other people to achieve his or her own goals Have excessive feelings of self-importance Exaggerate achievements and talents Be preoccupied with fantasies of success, power, beauty, intelligence, or ideal love Have unreasonable expectations of favorable treatment Need constant attention and admiration Disregard the feelings of others, and have little ability to feel empathy Have obsessive self-interest Pursue mainly selfish goals"
3175,What causes Narcissistic personality disorder?,The causes of this disorder are unknown. An overly sensitive personality and parenting problems may affect the development of this disorder.
3176,What to expect if I have Narcissistic personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on the severity of the disorder.
3177,What are the symptoms of Narcolepsy?,"Periods of extreme drowsiness every 3 to 4 hours during the day. You may feel a strong urge to sleep, often followed by a short nap (sleep attack).
These periods last for about 15 minutes each, although they can be longer. They often happen after eating, but may occur while driving, talking to someone, or during other situations. You wake up feeling refreshed.
Dream-like hallucinations may occur during the stage between sleep and wakefulness. They involve seeing or hearing, and possibly other senses.
Sleep paralysis is when you are unable to move when you first wake up. It may also happen when you first become drowsy.
Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle tone while awake, resulting in the inability to move. Strong emotions, such as laughter or anger, will often bring on cataplexy.
Most attacks last for less than 30 seconds and can be missed. Your head will suddenly fall forward, your jaw will become slack, and your knees will buckle. In severe cases, a person may fall and stay paralyzed for as long as several minutes."
3178,What causes Narcolepsy?,"Narcolepsy is a nervous system disorder, not a mental illness. Anxiety does not cause narcolepsy.
Experts believe that narcolepsy is caused by reduced amounts of a protein called hypocretin, which is made in the brain. What causes the brain to produce less of this protein is unclear.
Narcolepsy tends to run in families.
Conditions that cause insomnia, such as disrupted work schedules, can make narcolepsy worse."
3179,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Narcolepsy ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of narcolepsy Narcolepsy does not respond to treatment, or you develop other symptoms"
3180,What to expect if I have Narcolepsy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Narcolepsy is a chronic, lifelong condition.

Abdominal distention Blood in the stool Diarrhea Feeding intolerance Lethargy Temperature instability Vomiting"
3182,What causes Necrotising enterocolitis?,"Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies and the tissue falls off. The cause for this disorder is unknown. However, it is thought that a decrease in blood flow to the bowel keeps the bowel from producing mucus that protects the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteria in the intestine may also be a cause.
This disorder usually develops in an infant that is already ill or premature, and most often develops while the infant is still in the hospital."

Birth defects Delay in clamping the umbilical cord Diabetes in the baby's birth mother Inherited diseases Not enough oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia) Twin-twin transfusion syndrome, which occurs when blood moves from one twin to the other.
The extra RBCs can block the flow of blood in the smallest blood vessels. This may lead to tissue death from lack of oxygen. This blocked blood flow can affect all organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and brain."
3192,What to expect if I have Neonatal polycythemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook is good for infants with mild hyperviscosity and those who receive treatment for severe hyperviscosity.
Some children may have mild changes in neurological development. Parents who believe their child may show any signs of developmental delay should contact their health care provider."
3193,What are the symptoms of Infant respiratory distress syndrome?,"The symptoms usually appear within minutes of birth, although they may not be seen for several hours. Symptoms may include:
Bluish color of the skin and mucus membranes (cyanosis). Brief stop in breathing (apnea). Decreased urine output. Grunting. Nasal flaring. Rapid breathing. Shallow breathing. Shortness of breath and grunting sounds while breathing. Unusual breathing movement -- drawing back of the chest muscles with breathing."
3194,What causes Infant respiratory distress syndrome?,"Infant RDS occurs in infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed.
The disease is mainly caused by a lack of a slippery, protective substance called surfactant, which helps the lungs inflate with air and keeps the air sacs from collapsing. This substance normally appears in fully developed lungs.
Infant RDS can also be the result of genetic problems with lung development.
The earlier a baby is born, the less developed the lungs are and the higher the chance of Infant RDS. Most cases are seen in babies born before 28 weeks. It is very uncommon in infants born full-term (at 40 weeks).
In addition to prematurity, the following increase the risk of Infant RDS:
A brother or sister who had RDS. Diabetes in the mother. Cesarean delivery. Delivery complications that reduce blood flow to the baby. Multiple pregnancy (twins or more). Rapid labor.
The risk of Infant RDS may be decreased if the pregnant mother has chronic, pregnancy-related high blood pressure or prolonged rupture of membranes, because the stress of these situations can cause the infant's lungs to mature sooner."
3195,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome ?,"This disorder usually develops shortly after birth while the baby is still in the hospital. If you have given birth at home or outside a medical center, seek emergency attention if your baby develops any difficulty breathing."
3196,What to expect if I have Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The Infant respiratory distress syndrome often worsens for 2 to 4 days after birth with slow improvement thereafter. Some infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome will die, although this is rare on the first day of life. If it occurs, it usually happens between days 2 and 7.
Long-term complications may develop as a result of too much oxygen, high pressures delivered to the lungs, the severity of the Infant respiratory distress syndrome itself, or periods when the brain or other organs did not receive enough oxygen."
3197,What are the symptoms of Neonatal sepsis?,"Infants with neonatal sepsis may have the following symptoms:
Body temperature changes Breathing problems Diarrhea Low blood sugar Reduced movements Reduced sucking Seizures Slow heart rate Swollen belly area Vomiting Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)"
3198,What causes Neonatal sepsis?,"A number of different bacteria, including Escherichia coli (E.coli), Listeria, and certain strains of streptococcus, may cause neonatal sepsis.
Early-onset neonatal sepsis most often appears within 24 hours of birth. The baby gets the infection from the mother before or during delivery. The following increases an infant's risk of early-onset sepsis:
Group B streptococcus infection during pregnancy Preterm delivery Water breaking (rupture of membranes) that lasts longer than 24 hours before birth Infection of the placenta tissues and amniotic fluid (chorioamnionitis)
Babies with late-onset neonatal sepsis get infected after delivery. The following increase an infant's risk of sepsis after delivery:
Having a catheter in a blood vessel for a long time Staying in the hospital for an extended period of time"
3199,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neonatal sepsis ?,Seek immediate medical help if your infant shows symptoms of neonatal sepsis.
3200,What to expect if I have Neonatal sepsis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With prompt treatment, many babies with these bacterial infections will recover completely with no remaining problems. Nevertheless, neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of infant death. The more quickly an infant receives treatment, the better the outcome."
3201,What are the symptoms of Neoplastic meningitis?,"The 3 affected neurologic domains of neoplastic meningitis in order of involvement is spinal cord and roots (60%) cranial nerve (35%) and cerebral hemisphere (15%)  Documented spinal cord manifestations of NM include: weakness (upper limb greater than the lower limb), sensory deficits in dermatomal origin and pain in the neck, back and upper extremity that is most frequently radicular. Cranial nerve manifestation includes diplopia which is the most common sign in this category; trigeminal sensory and motor loss, cochlear dysfunction and optic neuropathy have also been observed. Cerebral hemisphere manifestations are mostly vague and non-specific includes headache and mental status changes. Symptoms are often multifocal and neuraxal. The most common presenting symptom of neoplastic meningitis is pain or seizure."
3202,What causes Neoplastic meningitis?,Neoplastic meningitis is caused by another tumor seeding into the CNS Cancer from a distant source enter the CSF by means of the following:  Hematogenous Spread from a distant primary tumor site - cancer cells produce enzymes that allows them to microscopically invade blood vessels to reach the subarachnoid space through the systemic arterial circulation or by the Batsons venous plexus. Invasion from a primary brain tumor to the meninges - when cancer cells lodge into small arteries causing local ischemia and blood vessel damage leading to spillage of neoplastic cells to the Virchow-Robin spaces thereby providing access to the subarachnoid space. Infiltration to the spinal cord - Cancer cells gain access to the subarachnoid space through this route via the perivascular tissues the surround the blood vessels at the brain entrance. Direct infiltration of the spinal nerve roots (dorsal and ventral) has also been documented. Cancer spread a neural pathways to reach the meninges - The CSF carries cancer cells through the brain tracts. This occurs mostly in tumors of the head and neck.  Iatrogenic - from surgical procedures involving removal of a primary brain tumor Primary neoplastic meningitis has also been documented particularly with melanoma.
3203,Who is at highest risk for Neoplastic meningitis ?,"Patients with advanced breast cancer have increased propensity for NM. ER-, PR-positivity in beast cancer increases incidence of neoplastic meningitis. Triple negative breast cancer and the HER2/neu gene positivity displays tropism for CNS metastasis. Among the histologic subtypes of breast cancer, loblular carcinoma demonstrated the highest prevalence for neoplastic meningitis. Brain surgery increases the chance of developing NM. It has been observed after resection of brain tumor (particularly piecemeal resection vs en-block resection) particularly tumors located in the cerebellum. Other cranial surgeries done with involvement of ventricular system manipulation in a patient with known brain metastasis increases the risk. Furthermore, the incidence of neoplastic meningitis seem higher in patient treated with surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery compared with radiosurgery alone. Primary brain cancer always poses a risk for the development of neoplastic meningitis. It is diagnosed in 1-2% of cases of ependymoma, medulloblastoma, germinoma and glioblastoma combined. Brain metastasis is one of the more obvious risk factors for neoplastic meningitis. Coexisting brain metastasis are associated with neoplastic meningitis in breast cancer (33-54%), lung cancer (56-82%) and melanoma (87-96%)."
3204,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neoplastic meningitis ?,"Patients with documented cancer manifesting with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, cardiorespiratory distress and sudden onset neurological deficiets should seek urgent care."
3205,What to expect if I have Neoplastic meningitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The rates of survival for neoplastic meningitis varies depending on the source of primary tumor, but generally median survival rate without treatment is limited to 1 to 2 months. With treatment, this could extend to 2 to 5 months for breast cancer, 3 to 6 months for non-small cell lung cancer and 2 to 4 months for melanoma. Factors affecting the prognosis of patients with neoplastic meningitis includes gene involvement and use of immunotherapy and other targeted therapies. For breast cancer, ER-positivity, lesser extend of initial disease and better performance status has been demonstrated to have better prognosis. For lung cancer, the use of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitors confers durable responses without the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy administration. Lastly, for melanoma, primary tumors located in the trunk has been documented to have a poor prognosis, but intra-CSF administration of chemotherapy significantly improves this prognosis.  Not surprisingly, patients with poor performance status, multiple fixed neurological deficits, bulks CNS disease, co-existent carcinomatous encephalopathy and CSF flow abnormalities will do poorly with intensive treatment of disease. Death typically results from progression of neurological dysfunction.  Some retrospective studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes in neoplastic meningitis: age less than 60, long duration of symptoms, controlled systemic disease, Karnofsky performance status >/= 70, absence of encephalopathy or cranial nerve deficit, initially low CSF protein level, absence of CSF compartamentalization or bulky CNS disease manifested by impedance of CSF flow and history of primary breast tumor."
3206,What are the symptoms of Nephritic syndrome?,"Common symptoms of nephritic syndrome are:
Swelling of the face, eye socket, legs, arms, hands, feet, abdomen, or other areas Blood in the urine (urine appears dark, tea colored, or cloudy) Decreased urine volume (little or no urine may be produced)
Other symptoms that may occur include:
Blurred vision General aches and pains (joint pain, muscle aches) General ill feeling (malaise) Headache Slow, sluggish, lethargic movement Cough containing mucus or pink, frothy material Decreased alertness, drowsiness, confusion
Patients may develop symptoms of acute kidney failure or end-stage renal disease."
3207,What causes Nephritic syndrome?,"Acute nephritic syndrome is often caused by an immune response that is triggered by an infection or other disease.
Frequent causes in children and adolescents include the following:
IgA nephropathy Henoch-Schonlein purpura Hemolytic uremic syndrome Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
Frequent causes in adults include:
Abdominal abscesses Infective endocarditis Klebsiella pneumonia Goodpasture syndrome Hepatitis Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis I & II. Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis (RPGN) SLE or lupus nephritis Syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases Typhoid fever Vasculitis Viral diseases such as mononucleosis, measles, mumps
The inflammation disrupts the functioning of the glomerulus, which is the part of the kidney that controls filtering and getting rid of wastes. This disruption results in blood and protein appearing in the urine, and the buildup of excess fluid in the body. Swelling occurs when protein is lost from the bloodstream. (Protein maintains fluid within the blood vessels, and when it is lost the fluid collects in the tissues of the body). Blood loss from the damaged kidney structures leads to blood in the urine.
Acute nephritic syndrome may be associated with the development of:
High blood pressure Swelling of the spaces between the cells of the kidney tissue Acute kidney failure"
3208,Who is at highest risk for Nephritic syndrome ?,Infections with Group A Streptococcal bacateria (APSGN)
3209,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nephritic syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of acute nephritic syndrome.
3210,What to expect if I have Nephritic syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on the disease causing the nephritis. When the condition improves, symptoms of fluid retention (such as swelling and cough) and high blood pressure may go away in 1 or 2 weeks. However, urine tests take months to return to normal.
Children tend to do better than adults and usually recover completely. Only rarely do they develop complications or progress to chronic glomerulonephritis.
Adults do not recover as well or as quickly as children. Although it is unusual for the disease to return, at least one-third of adults whose acute nephritic syndrome does return will eventually develop end-stage kidney disease."
3211,What are the symptoms of Nephrotic syndrome?,"Swelling is the most common symptom. It may occur:
In the face and around the eyes. In the arms and legs, especially in the feet and ankles In the belly area (swollen abdomen)
Other symptoms include:
Foamy appearance of the urine Weight gain (unintentional) from fluid retention Poor appetite High blood pressure
Patients that experience any of the above signs and symptoms should see their primary care physician immediately."
3212,What causes Nephrotic syndrome?,"Causes of Nephrotic Syndrome can be primary (that is; from the kidney glomeruli) or secondary (from an external insult to the kidney). Primary cause of Nephrotic Syndrome is often referred to as Idiopathic i.e. there are no known causes for the kidney abnormality. Such is the case in Minimal change kidney disease seen in children. Primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are usually described by the histology, e.g. minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and membranous nephropathy (MN). These diseases are considered to be "" diagnoses of exclusion,"" meaning they are diagnosed only after secondary causes have been excluded.
Secondary Nephrotic Syndrome is nephrotic syndrome that is associated with well-known kidney diseases like autoimmune disease like Henoin Scholein purpura, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis etc. Secondary Nephrotic syndrome is also associated with post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Alport's syndrome. It has also been associated with allergic reactions, drugs like NSAIDs, vaccination like the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, tumors and viral infections.
A complete list of possible causes of nephrotic syndrome can be found here."
3213,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nephrotic syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms which may indicate nephrotic syndrome occur.
Call your health care provider if nephrotic syndrome persists or if new symptoms develop, including severe headache, fever, sores on the skin, cough, discomfort with urination, or decreased urine output.
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if convulsions occur."
3214,What to expect if I have Nephrotic syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome varies; the syndrome may be acute and short-term or chronic and unresponsive to therapy. The cause and development of complications also affects the outcome.
3215,What are the symptoms of Neuroblastoma?,"The signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma can vary widely depending on where the disease first started and how much it has spread to other parts of the body. Usual symptoms include:
Irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite, and fever in infant. A swollen stomach, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite in young child. Bone pain or soreness, black eyes, bruises, and pale skin Weakness, numbness, inability to move a body part, or difficulty walking Horner's syndrome: Drooping eyelid, unequal pupils, sweating, and red skin Difficulty breathing
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3216,Who is at highest risk for Neuroblastoma ?,Scientists found the cause of neuroblastoma is related to abnormalities in the DNA of neuroblasts.
3217,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neuroblastoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of neuroblastoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Abdominal pain in child Bone pain in child"
3218,What to expect if I have Neuroblastoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of neuroblastoma is poor and it depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread The child’s general health"
3219,What are the symptoms of Neurosyphilis?,"Abnormal walk (gait) Blindness Confusion Dementia Depression Headache Incontinence Inability to walk Irritability Numbness in the toes, feet, or legs Poor concentration Seizures Stiff neck Tremors Visual disturbances Weakness"
3220,What causes Neurosyphilis?,"Neurosyphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that cause syphilis. It usually occurs about 10 - 20 years after a person is first infected with syphilis. Not everyone who has syphilis will develop this complication.
There are four different forms of neurosyphilis:
Asymptomatic (most common form) General paresis Meningovascular Tabes dorsalis
Asymptomatic neurosyphilis occurs before symptomatic syphilis."
3221,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neurosyphilis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have had syphilis in the past and now have signs of neurological problems.
3222,What to expect if I have Neurosyphilis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,This is considered a life-threatening complication of syphilis. How well you do depends on how severe the neurosyphilis is before treatment.
3223,What are the symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease?,"Type A usually begins in the first few months of life. Symptoms may include:
Abdominal (belly area) swelling within 3 - 6 months Cherry red spot in the eye Feeding difficulties Loss of early motor skills (gets worse over time)
Type B symptoms are usually milder and occur in late childhood or adolescence. Abdominal swelling may occur in early childhood, but there is almost no brain and nervous system involvement, such as loss of motor skills. Some patients may have repeated respiratory infections.
Type C usually affects school-aged children, but the disease may occur any time between early infancy to adulthood. Symptoms may include:
Difficulty moving limbs (dystonia) Enlarged spleen Enlarged liver Jaundice at (or shortly after) birth Learning difficulties and intellectual decline (dementia) Seizures Slurred, irregular speech Sudden loss of muscle tone which may lead to falls (cataplexy) Tremors Trouble moving the eyes up and down (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy) Unsteady gait, clumsiness, walking problems (ataxia)
Symptoms of Type D are similar to Type C.
Type E occurs in adults. Symptoms include swelling of the spleen and brain and nervous system (neurological) problems. Little is known about this rare type of Niemann-Pick disease.
Symptoms and disease progression of all forms of Niemann-Pick vary from person to person. Other, more common, diseases may cause symptoms similar to Niemann-Pick.
A person in the early stages of the disease may show only a few symptoms. Not every symptom will be seen in the later stages of the disease."
3224,What causes Niemann-Pick disease?,"Niemann-Pick disease Type A and B occur when cells in the body lack an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). ASM helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell of the body.
If ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This leads to cell death and makes it hard for organs to work properly. Type A occurs in all races and ethnicities, but higher rates are seen in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jew population.
Niemann-Pick Type C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and excessive amounts of other lipids in the brain.
There may be reduced ASM activity in some cells. Type C Niemann-Pick disease has been reported in all ethnic groups but it is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent.
Type D Niemann-Pick involves a defect that interferes with the movement of cholesterol between brain cells. It is now thought to be a variant of type C. This type of Niemann-Pick disease has only been found in the French Canadian population of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.
There may also be an adult-onset form of Niemann-Pick disease. It is sometimes referred to as Type E disease."
3225,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Niemann-Pick disease ?,"Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have a family history of Niemann-Pick disease and you plan to have children. Genetic counseling and screening is recommended.
Call your health care provider if your child has symptoms of this disease, including
Developmental problems Feeding problems Poor weight gain"
3226,What to expect if I have Niemann-Pick disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Type A Niemann-Pick is a severe disease, which generally leads to death by age 2 or 3.
Those with Type B may live into late childhood or adulthood.
A child who shows signs of Type C before age 1 may not live to school age. Those who show show symptoms after entering school may live into their mid-to-late teens, with a few surviving into the 20s."
3227,What causes Non Hemolytic Anemia?,"Possible substances that can cause hemolytic anemia include:
Anti-malaria drugs (quinine compounds) Arsenic Dapsone Intravenous water infusion (not half-normal saline or normal saline) Metals (chromium/chromates, platinum salts, nickel compounds, copper, lead, cis-platinum) Nitrites Nitrofurantoin Phenazopyridine (Pyridium) Rho immune globulin (WinRho) Ribavirin Snake bites (some snake venom contains hemolytic toxins) Sulfonamides Sulfones"
3228,What are the symptoms of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer?,"Common symptoms of lung cancer include
A cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time Constant chest pain Coughing up blood Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness Repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis Swelling of the neck and face Loss of appetite or weight loss Fatigue"
3229,Who is at highest risk for Non small cell lung cancer ?,"People with constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk. Working with or near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Such chemicals include:
Asbestos Chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust Certain alloys, paints, pigments, and preservatives Products using chloride and formaldehyde"
3230,What to expect if I have Non small cell lung cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook varies. Most often, non small cell lung cancer grows slowly. In some cases, it can grow and spread quickly and cause rapid death. The cancer may spread to other parts of the body, including the bone, liver, small intestine, and brain. Chemotherapy has been shown to prolong life and improve the quality of life in some patients with stage IV non small cell lung cancer. Cure rates are related to the stage of disease and whether you are able to have surgery.
Stage I and II cancers have the highest survival and cure rates. Stage III cancer can be cured in some cases. Stage IV cancer that has returned is almost never cured. The goals of therapy are to extend and improve quality of life."
3231,What are the symptoms of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,Weakness Liver enlargement Swelling of the abdomen Breast enlargement Pain in the upper right abdomen Yellowing of the skin and eyes Enlargement of spleen
3232,What causes Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,"Obesity Insulin resistance Metabolic syndrome Hormonal imbalances Oxidative stress - A imbalance between the production of free radicals and the ability of the body to counteract or detoxify their harmful effects through neutralization by antioxidants Endotoxemia - The presence of endotoxins in the blood which may cause hemorrhages, necrosis of the kidneys, and shock. Mitochondrial abnormalities"

Depending on the extent of the fibrosis and cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, the prognosis may vary. The presence of fibrosis and cirrhosis associated with a particularly poor prognosis among patients with NAFLD."
3236,What are the symptoms of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"Early Non-Hodgkin lymphoma does not have any symptoms. People may notice one or more of the following symptoms as the tumor developing or when detected by regular examinations:
Fever Night sweat Unexplained weight loss Severe itchiness Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
Coughing or shortness of breath may occur if the cancer affects the thymus gland or lymph nodes in the chest, which may put pressure on the windpipe (trachea) or other airways.
Some patients may have abdominal pain or swelling, which may lead to a loss of appetite, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
If the cancer affects cells in the brain, the person may have a headache, concentration problems, personality changes, or seizures."
3237,What causes Non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"White blood cells called lymphocytes are found in lymph tissues. They help prevent infections. Most lymphomas start in a type of white blood cells called B lymphocytes, or B cells.
For most patients, the cause of this cancer is unknown. However, lymphomas may develop in people with weakened immune systems. For example, the risk of lymphoma increases after an organ transplant or in people with HIV infection.
There are many different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is grouped according to how fast the cancer spreads.
The cancer may be low grade (slow growing), intermediate grade, or high grade (fast growing). Burkitt's lymphoma is an example of a high-grade lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a low-grade lymphoma. The cancer is further grouped by how the cells look under the microscope, for example, if there are certain proteins or genetic markers present.
According to the American Cancer Society, a person has a 1 in 50 chance of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. NHL most often affects adults. However, children can get some forms of lymphoma. You are more likely to get lymphoma if you have a weakened immune system or have had an organ transplant.
This type of cancer is slightly more common in men than in women."
3238,Who is at highest risk for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is related to several factors.
Immune system deficiency: People with weakened immune systems, such as people who receive organ transplants or infected with HIV, have an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Autoimmune diseases: Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and others have been linked with an increased rate of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Certain infections such as T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Exposure of chemicals such as benzene, certain herbicides and insecticides, exposure to radiation Bad life-style: Overweight, obese, diet poor in vegetables. Age: Most cases of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma occur in people older than 60. Gender: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs slightly more often in men than in women. Geography: Worldwide, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having the highest rates."
3239,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Non-Hodgkin lymphoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:

Age Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level Performance status Clinical stage Sites of extranodal disease"
3241,What are the symptoms of Norovirus infection?,"Because there are so many types of noroviruses, you can become infected and show symptoms many times. Symptoms usually develop within hours or a few days after you are infected with a norovirus. It usually takes a couple of days before you are better. Symptoms of gastroenteritis caused by noroviruses can include:
Nausea Abdominal cramps Vomiting Diarrhea Headache Fatigue Fever Muscle aches"
3242,What causes Norovirus infection?,"The main viruses that cause gastroenteritis used to be called ""Norwalk-like viruses"" because Norwalk is the most well-known virus in this group. Now the viruses are referred to as noroviruses. Noroviruses are not new, but interest in them is growing as researchers learn how frequently they make people sick. Norovirus infections are implicated in newsworthy descriptions of outbreaks on military and cruise ships and in hotels, restaurants, daycare centers, nursing homes, and hospitals. Decontamination of these places has proved to be challenging. Noroviruses are not related to bacteria or parasites that also can cause gastrointestinal illnesses."
3243,What are the symptoms of Obsessive compulsive personality disorder?,"OCPD has some of the same symptoms as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, people with OCD have unwanted thoughts, while people with OCPD believe that their thoughts are correct.
People with both OCPD and OCD tend to be high achievers and feel a sense of urgency about their actions. They may become very upset if other people interfere with their rigid routines. They may not be able to express their anger directly. Instead, people with OCPD experience feelings that they consider more appropriate, like anxiety or frustration.
A person with this personality disorder has symptoms of perfectionism that usually begin in early adulthood. This perfectionism may interfere with the person's ability to complete tasks, because their standards are so rigid.
People with this disorder may emotionally withdraw when they are not able to control a situation. This can interfere with their ability to solve problems and form close relationships.
Some of the other signs of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder include:
Excess devotion to work Inability to throw things away, even when the objects have no value Lack of flexibility Lack of generosity Not wanting to allow other people to do things Not willing to show affection Preoccupation with details, rules, and lists"
3244,What causes Obsessive compulsive personality disorder?,"Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder tends to occur in families, so genes may be involved. A person's childhood and environment may also play roles. This condition can affect both men and women, but it most often occurs in men."
3245,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Obsessive compulsive personality disorder ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if perfectionism is interfering with your job or relationships.
3246,What to expect if I have Obsessive compulsive personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook for people with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder tends to be better than that for other personality disorders.
The rigidness and control of OCPD may prevent many of the complications such as drug abuse, which are common in other personality disorders.
However, the social isolation and difficulty handling anger that are common with this illness may lead to feelings of depression and anxiety later in life."
3247,What are the symptoms of Obsessive compulsive disorder?,"Obsessions or compulsions that are not due to medical illness or drug use Obsessions or compulsions that cause major distress or interfere with everyday life
There are many types of obsessions and compulsions. One example is an excessive fear of germs and the compulsion to repeatedly wash the hands to ward off infection.
The person usually recognizes that the behavior is excessive or unreasonable."
3248,What causes Obsessive compulsive disorder?,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is more common than was once thought. Most people who develop it show symptoms by age 30.
It is generally agreed that neurotransmitters,biological and also psychological factors play a role in causing obsessive–compulsive disorder. Environmental factors also play a role in causing OCD. About 20% of people with OCD have tics, which suggests the condition may be related to Tourette syndrome. However, this link is not clear."
3249,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Obsessive-compulsive disorder ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if your symptoms interfere with daily life, work, or relationships."
3250,What to expect if I have Obsessive-compulsive disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"OCD is a long-term (chronic) illness with periods of severe symptoms followed by times of improvement. However, a completely symptom-free period is unusual. Most people improve with treatment."
3251,What are the symptoms of occupational lung disease?,Chronic cough Shortness of breath
3252,Who is at highest risk for Occupational lung disease ?,Your risk of developing the occupational lung disease depends on how long you have been exposed to a specific agent.

3259,What to expect if I have Oncocytoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of oncocytoma depends on the surgery. Nephrectomy is an effective treatment for oncocytoma. After surgery, the outcome is good for patients."
3260,What are the symptoms of Ondine's curse?,"Symptoms are usually worse during sleep, and periods of apnea (episodes of stopped breathing) are usually present.
Often patients themselves do not complain of shortness of breath during the day.
Symptoms include:
Bluish coloration of the skin caused by lack of oxygen Daytime drowsiness Fatigue Lethargy Morning headaches Swelling of the ankles Waking up from sleep unrested Waking up many times at night
Persons with this disease are extremely sensitive to even small doses of sedatives or narcotics, which can make their already inadequate breathing much worse."
3261,What causes Ondine's curse?,"Normally, when the oxygen levels in the blood are low or the carbon dioxide levels are high, there is a signal from the brain to breathe more deeply or more quickly. In people with primary alveolar hypoventilation, this change in breathing does not happen.
The cause of primary alveolar hypoventilation is unknown. Some patients have a specific genetic defect.
The disease mainly affects men 20 to 50 years old, although it may also occur in young boys."
3262,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ondine%27s curse ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms of this disorder develop.
Seek urgent medical care if bluish skin (cyanosis) occurs."
3263,What to expect if I have Ondine%27s curse  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Response to treatment varies.
3264,What causes Opisthotonus?,"Opisthotonos may occur in infants with meningitis. It may also occur as a sign of reduced brain function or injury to the nervous system.
Other causes may include:
Arnold-Chiari syndrome (a problem with the structure of the brain) Brain tumor Gaucher disease Growth hormone deficiency (occasionally) Glutaric aciduria and organic acidemias (forms of chemical poisoning) Krabbe Disease Seizures Severe electrolyte imbalance Severe head injury Stiff-person syndrome (a condition that makes a person rigid and have spasms) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) Tetanus
Drugs such as phenothiazines and other antipsychotic medications, can cause a side effect called acute dystonic reaction. Opisthotonos may be part of this reaction.
In rare cases, infants born to women who drink large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy may have opisthotonus due to alcohol withdrawal."
3265,Who is at highest risk for Opisthotonus ?,Opisthotonos is much more common in infants and children than in adults. It is also more exaggerated in infants and children because of their less mature nervous systems.
3266,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Opisthotonus ?,Go to the emergency room or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if this symptom occurs. Typically opisthotonos is a symptom of other conditions that are serious enough for a person to seek medical attention.
3267,What are the symptoms of Oppositional defiant disorder?,"Symptoms include:
Actively does not follow adults' requests Angry and resentful of others Argues with adults Blames others for own mistakes Has few or no friends or has lost friends Is in constant trouble in school Loses temper Spiteful or seeks revenge Touchy or easily annoyed
To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.
The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level.
The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities."
3268,What causes Oppositional defiant disorder?,"This disorder is more common in boys than in girls.
Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior, and possible racial, cultural, and gender biases.
This behavior typically starts by age 8, but it may start as early as the preschool years.
This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors."
3269,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Oppositional defiant disorder ?,Call your health care provider if you have concerns about your child's development or behavior.
3270,What to expect if I have Oppositional defiant disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not."
3271,What are the symptoms of Optic nerve glioma?,"The symptoms are due to the tumor growing and pressing on the optic nerve and nearby structures. Symptoms may include:
Involuntary eyeball movement One or both eyes may bulge outward Squinting Vision loss in one or both eyes Leads to eventual blindness May be a loss of peripheral vision or vision loss may be more general
The patient may show symptoms of diencephalic syndrome, which includes delayed growth, loss of appetite and body fat, daytime sleeping and decreased memory and intellectual function."
3272,What causes Optic nerve glioma?,"Optic gliomas are rare. The cause of optic gliomas is unknown. Most optic gliomas are slow-growing and noncancerous (benign) and occur in children, almost always before age 20. There is a strong association between optic glioma and neurofibromatosis type 1."
3273,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Optic nerve glioma ?,"Call your health care provider if you have any vision loss, painless bulging of your eye forward, or other symptoms of this condition."
3274,What to expect if I have Optic nerve glioma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook is highly variable. Early treatment improves the chance of a good outcome. Many tumors are curable with surgery, while others return.
Normally, the growth of the tumor is very slow, and the condition remains stable for long periods of time. However, in adults and some childhood cases where the optic chiasm is involved, the tumor behaves aggressively."
3275,What are the symptoms of Oral cancer?,"Mucous membrane lesion, lump, or ulcer:
May be a deep, hard-edged crack in the tissue Most often pale colored, may be dark or discolored On the tongue, lip, or other mouth area Usually painless at first (may develop a burning sensation or pain when the tumor is advanced) Usually small
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease:
Abnormal taste in the mouth Mouth sores Swallowing difficulty Tongue problems"
3276,What causes Oral cancer?,"Oral cancer most commonly involves the tissue of the lips or the tongue. It may also occur on the floor of the mouth, cheek lining, gums (gingiva), or roof of the mouth (palate).
Most oral cancers look very similar under the microscope and are called squamous cell carcinomas. These are malignant and tend to spread rapidly.
Smoking and other tobacco use are associated with 70 - 80% of oral cancer cases. Smoke and heat from cigarettes, cigars, and pipes irritate the mucous membranes of the mouth. Use of chewing tobacco or snuff causes irritation from direct contact with the mucous membranes. Heavy alcohol use is another activity associated with increased risk for oral cancer.
Other factors that increase the risk of oral cancer include poor dental and oral hygiene and chronic irritation (such as from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings). Some oral cancers begin as a white plaque (leukoplakia) or as a mouth ulcer. Recently, an infection with HPV (human papilloma virus) has been shown to be a risk factor.
Oral cancer accounts for about 8% of all malignant growths. Men get oral cancer twice as often as women do, particularly men older than 40."
3277,Who is at highest risk for Oral cancer ?,Smokers People infected with HPV People who practice poor dental and oral hygiene
3278,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Oral cancer ?,"Oral cancer may be discovered when the dentist performs a routine cleaning and examination.
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have a lesion of the mouth or lip or a lump in the neck that does not go away within 1 month. Early diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer greatly increases the chances of survival."
3279,What to expect if I have Oral cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Approximately half of people with oral cancer will live more than 5 years after diagnosis and treatment. If the cancer is detected early, before it has spread to other tissues, the cure rate is nearly 75%. Unfortunately, more than half of oral cancers are advanced at the time the cancer is detected. By the time of diagnosis, most have spread to the throat or neck.
Approximately 25% of people with oral cancer die because of delayed diagnosis and treatment."
3280,What are the symptoms of Oral candidiasis?,"Thrush appears as whitish, velvety lesions in the mouth and on the tongue. Underneath the whitish material, there is red tissue that may bleed easily. The lesions can slowly increase in number and size."
3281,What causes Oral candidiasis?,"Thrush is caused by forms of a fungus called Candida. A small amount of this fungus lives in your mouth most of the time. It is usually kept in check by your immune system and other types of germs that also normally live in your mouth. However, when your immune system is weaker, the fungus can grow, leading to sores (lesions) in your mouth and on your tongue. The following can increase your chances of getting thrush:
Taking steroid medications Having an HIV infection or AIDS Receiving chemotherapy for cancer or drugs to suppress your immune system following an organ transplantation Being very old or very young Being in poor health"
3282,Who is at highest risk for Oral candidiasis ?,Thrush is commonly seen in infants. It is not considered abnormal in infants unless it lasts longer than a couple of weeks. Candida can also cause yeast infections in the vagina. People who have diabetes and had high blood sugar levels are more likely to get thrush in the mouth (oral thrush) because the extra sugar in your saliva acts like food for candida. Taking high doses of antibiotics or taking antibiotics for a long time also increases the risk of oral thrush. Antibiotics kill some of the healthy bacteria that help keep Candida from growing too much. People with poorly fitting dentures are also more likely to get thrush.
3283,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Oral candidiasis ?,"Call your doctor if:
Your infant has had lesions in the mouth consistent with thrush for at least 2 weeks. Your infant is eating poorly due to the lesions. You are a teen or adult with lesions that are consistent with thrush. You have pain or difficulty swallowing. You have symptoms of thrush and you are HIV positive, receiving chemotherapy, or take medications to suppress your immune system."
3284,What to expect if I have Oral candidiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Thrush in infants may be painful but is rarely serious. Because of discomfort, it can interfere with eating. If it does not resolve on its own within 2 weeks, call your pediatrician. In adults, thrush that occurs in the mouth can be cured. However, the long-term outlook is dependent on your immune status and the cause of the immune deficit."
3285,What are the symptoms of Oral ulcer?,"Symptoms vary and depend on the specific cause of the mouth ulcer. In general, symptoms may include:
Open sores in the mouth Pain or discomfort in the mouth"
3286,What causes Oral ulcer?,"Mouth ulcers are caused by many disorders. These include:
Canker sores Gingivostomatitis Herpes simplex (fever blister) Leukoplakia Oral cancer Oral lichen planus Oral thrush
The skin lesion of histoplasmosis may also appear as a mouth ulcer."
3287,Who is at highest risk for Oral ulcer ?,People with decreased immunity are at higher risk of getting oral ulcer
3288,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Oral ulcer ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if your mouth ulcers don't go away after 3 weeks. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if mouth ulcers return frequently, or if new symptoms develop."
3289,What to expect if I have Oral ulcer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies depending on the cause of the ulcer. Many mouth ulcers are harmless and heal without treatment. There are types of cancer, however, that may first appear as a mouth ulcer that does not heal."
3290,What are the symptoms of Orbital cellulitis?,"Symptoms of orbital cellulitis may include:
Painful swelling of upper and lower eyelid, and possibly the eyebrow and cheek Bulging eyes Decreased vision Eye pain, especially when moving the eye Fever, generally 102 degrees F or higher General feeling of discomfort Painful or difficult eye movements Shiny, red or purple eyelid"
3291,What causes Orbital cellulitis?,"Orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection with potentially serious complications.
Bacteria from a sinus infection (often Haemophilus influenzae) usually cause this condition in children. Orbital cellulitis due to this bacteria used to be much more common in young children up to age 6 - 7. However, such infection is now rare because of the HiB (Haemophilus influenzae B) vaccine.
The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci may also cause orbital cellulitis.
Other causes include a stye on the eyelid, bug bites, or a recent eyelid injury.
Orbital cellulitis infections in children may get worse very quickly and can lead to blindness. Immediate medical attention is needed"
3292,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Orbital cellulitis ?,"Orbital cellulitis is an emergency that requires immediate treatment. Call your health care provider if there are signs of eyelid swelling, especially with a fever."
3293,What to expect if I have Orbital cellulitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With prompt treatment, the person can make a complete recovery."
3294,What are the symptoms of Organic brain syndrome?,"Symptoms can differ based on the disease.
In general, organic brain syndromes cause:
Agitation Confusion Long-term loss of brain function (dementia) Severe, short-term loss of brain function (delirium)"
3295,What causes Organic brain syndrome?,"Disorders associated with OBS include:
Brain injury caused by trauma:
Bleeding into the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage) Bleeding into the space around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) Blood clot inside the skull causing pressure on brain (subdural hematoma) Concussion
Breathing conditions:
Low oxygen in the body (hypoxia) High carbon dioxide levels in the body (hypercapnia)
Cardiovascular disorders:
Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias) Brain injury due to high blood pressure (hypertensive brain injury) Dementia due to many strokes (multi-infarct dementia) Heart infections (endocarditis, myocarditis) Stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Degenerative disorders:
Alzheimer's disease (also called senile dementia, Alzheimer's type) Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease Diffuse Lewy Body disease Huntington's disease Multiple sclerosis Normal pressure hydrocephalus Parkinson's disease Pick's disease
Dementia due to metabolic causes
Drug and alcohol-related conditions:
Alcohol withdrawal state Intoxication from drug or alcohol use Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (a long-term effect of excessive alcohol consumption or malnutrition) Withdrawal from drugs (especially sedative - hypnotics and corticosteroids)
Infections:
Any sudden onset (acute) or long-term (chronic) infection Blood poisoning (septicemia) Brain infection (encephalitis) Meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord)
Other medical disorders:
Cancer Kidney disease Liver disease Thyroid disease (high or low) Vitamin deficiency (B1, B12, or folate)"
3296,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Organic brain syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have been diagnosed with organic brain syndrome and you are uncertain about the exact disorder. You have symptoms of this condition. You have been diagnosed with OBS and your symptoms become worse."
3297,What to expect if I have Organic brain syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some disorders are short-term and treatable, but many are long-term or get worse over time."
3298,What are the symptoms of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,"Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Cough Coughing up blood Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks Neck pain Sore throat that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks, even with antibiotics Swelling or lumps in the neck Unintentional weight loss"
3299,What causes Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Excessive alcohol use also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancers.
3300,Who is at highest risk for Oropharyngeal cancer ?,Most cancers of the throat develop in adults older than 50. Men are 10 times more likely than women to develop throat cancers.
3301,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Oropharyngeal cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of throat cancer, especially hoarseness or a change in voice with no obvious cause that lasts longer than 3 weeks You find a lump in your neck that does not go away in 2 - 3 weeks"
3302,What to expect if I have Oropharyngeal cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Throat cancers can be cured in 90% of patients if detected early. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, 50 - 60% of patients can be cured. If the cancer has spread (metastasized) to parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable and treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life.
After treatment, patients generally need therapy to help with speech and swallowing. A small percentage of patients (5%) will not be able to swallow and will need to be fed through a feeding tube."
3303,What are the symptoms of Osteomyelitis?,"Bone pain Fever General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill-feeling (malaise) Local swelling, redness, and warmth
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Chills Excessive sweating Low back pain Swelling of the ankles, feet, and legs"
3304,What causes Osteomyelitis?,"Bone infection can be caused by bacteria (more common) or fungi (less common). Infection may spread to a bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone, as in osteomyelitis that occurs under a chronic skin ulcer (sore). The infection that causes osteomyelitis can also start in another part of the body and spread to the bone through the blood. A current or past injury may have made the affected bone more likely to develop the infection. A bone infection can also start after bone surgery, especially if the surgery is done after an injury or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone. In children, the long bones are usually affected. In adults, the feet, spine bones (vertebrae), and the hips (pelvis) are most commonly affected."
3305,Who is at highest risk for Osteomyelitis ?,Diabetes Hemodialysis Injected drug use Poor blood supply Recent trauma People who have had their spleen removed are also at higher risk for osteomyelitis.
3306,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Osteomyelitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of osteomyelitis You have osteomyelitis and the symptoms continue despite treatment"
3307,What to expect if I have Osteomyelitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, the outcome for acute osteomyelitis is usually good. The outlook is worse for those with long-term (chronic) osteomyelitis, even with surgery. Amputation may be needed, especially in those with diabetes or poor blood circulation. The outlook for those with an infection of an orthopedic prosthesis depends, in part, on:
The patient's health The type of infection Whether the infected prosthesis can be safely removed"
3308,What are the symptoms of Bone cancer (Osteosarcoma)?,"Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, and may have been occurring for some time. If the tumour is large, it can appear as a swelling. The affected bone is not as strong as normal bones and may fracture with minor trauma (a pathological fracture).
Bone fracture (may occur after what seems like a routine movement) Bone pain Limitation of motion Limping (if the tumor is in the leg) Pain when lifting (if the tumor is in the arm) Tenderness, swelling, or redness at the site of the tumor"
3309,Who is at highest risk for Osteosarcoma ?,"Age and height: Data suggest that the risk of osteosarcoma is highest during the teenage ""growth spurt."" Children with osteosarcoma are usually tall for their age. Radiation to bones: People who were treated with radiation for another cancer have a higher risk of later developing post-radiation (after radiation) osteosarcoma. Certain bone diseases: Some bone diseases such as Paget disease of bone and multiple hereditary osteochondromas may be risk factors of osteosarcoma. Inherited cancer syndromes: Syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and retinoblastoma may increase the risk of developing osteosarcoma."
3310,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Osteosarcoma ?,Speak to your doctor immediately if you are experiencing any of the above mentioned symptoms.
3311,What to expect if I have Osteosarcoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis for bone cancer varies immensely based on how far the cancer has spread in the body and what specific type of cancer it is. You should talk to your doctor about your specific condition and outlook to gain a better sense of your prognosis.
3312,What are the symptoms of Otitis externa?,"Common symptoms of otitis externa include the following:
Ear pain Ear itching Ear canal swelling Ear canal redness and pressure Fluid discharge Scaley skin in the ear canal Partial hearing loss
Less common symptoms that are specific malignant otitis externa include the following:
Facial paralysis Difficulty opening mouth Difficulty swallowing"
3313,What causes Otitis externa?,"Otitis externa is caused by sources of inflammation to the external ear:
Bacterial and fungal infections from trapped water in the ear canal. Spread of skin conditions such as eczema. Allergies. Excessive or abrasive use of cotton swabs, Q-tips etc. that scratch and damage the skin of the ear canal. Growth of the bone in the ear canal from persistent water pressure (also known as surfer's ear). Chemical irritants in cosmetic products, such as soaps or shampoos. Lack of earwax from excessive cleaning. Prolonged exposure to excessive humidity. A weakened immune system in the case of malignant otitis externa."
3314,Who is at highest risk for Otitis externa ?,"Swimmers and scuba divers. People living in humid, tropical climates. People with allergies or inflammation -based skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. People who use ear plugs or other in-ear devices consistently. People who have experienced a traumatic physical injury to the ear, such as a blunt impact. People with narrow ear canals. For malignant otitis externa, people with diabetes mellitus or undergoing chemotherapy due to weakened immune system. Elderly women between 65 and 74 years old."
3315,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Otitis externa ?,Ear pain does not subside after several weeks. Hearing loss becomes severe. Fever or flu -symptoms develop. It becomes difficult to swallow or to move the neck or jaw. It becomes difficult to breathe. Dizziness develops.
3316,What to expect if I have Otitis externa  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis for otitis externa is usually good with or without treatment. Recurring episodes may require treatment to resolve symptoms permanently. Malignant otitis externa has a poor prognosis without treatment; with treatment, the prognosis varies depending on the extent of infection and damage caused to the skull bones and nerves."
3317,What are the symptoms of otitis media?,"Otitis media is often difficult to detect because most children affected by this disorder do not yet have sufficient speech and language skills to tell someone what is bothering them. Common signs to look for are:
Ear pain Unusual irritability Difficulty sleeping Tugging or pulling at one or both ears Fever Fluid draining from the ear Loss of balance Unresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of hearing difficulty such as sitting too close to the television or being inattentive Clumsiness and poor balance Common cold symptoms"
3318,What causes Otitis media?,"Anything that causes the eustachian tubes in the middle ear to become swollen or blocked causes more fluids to build up in the middle ear behind the eardrum. These causes include:
Allergies Colds and sinus infections Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething Infected or overgrown adenoids Tobacco smoke or other irritants
Risk factors for ear infections include the following:
Attending daycare (especially those with more than 6 children) Changes in altitude or climate Cold climate Exposure to smoke Genetic factors (susceptibility to infection may run in families) Not being breastfed Pacifier use Recent ear infection Recent illness of any type (lowers resistance of the body to infection)"
3319,Who is at highest risk for Otitis media ?,"Infants and young children are especially susceptible to ear infections: Immune systems are not fully developed. Smaller and straighter eustachian tubes are more prone to clogging. Larger adenoids interfering with eustachian tube openings. Close proximity with other infants and young children in settings such as schools or daycares, etc. Those with consistent exposure to air pollution, such as secondhand smoke."
3320,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Otitis media ?,"Call your child's doctor if:
Pain, fever, or irritability do not improve within 24 to 48 hours At the start, the child seems sicker than just an ear infection Your child has a high fever or severe pain Severe pain suddenly stops hurting -- this may indicate a ruptured eardrum Symptoms worsen New symptoms appear, especially severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles
For a child younger than 6 months, let the doctor know right away if the child has a fever, even if no other symptoms are present."
3321,What to expect if I have Otitis media  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Otitis media's prognosis is usually good without treatment. Otitis media from infection will usually go away naturally within two weeks. Otitis media from non-infectious causes with fluid buildup will usually go away naturally within 3 months. Complications from otitis media, including meningitis and mastoiditis (infections of the brain and bones around the skull, respectively) can lead to poor prognosis without treatment. Untreated otitis media may lead to permanent hearing impairment due to persistent fluid in the middle ear reducing a child's hearing. Children who have early hearing impairment from frequent ear infections are likely to have speech and language disabilities."
3322,What are the symptoms of Otosclerosis?,"Hearing loss (slow at first, but gets worse over time) Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Vertigo or dizzines"
3323,What causes Otosclerosis?,"The cause of otosclerosis is unknown. However, there is some evidence that it may be passed down through families. People who have otosclerosis have an abnormal sponge-like bone growing in the middle ear. This growth prevents the ear bones from vibrating in response to sound waves. Such vibrations are needed in order for you to hear. Otosclerosis is the most common cause of middle ear hearing loss in young adults. It typically begins in early to mid-adulthood. It is more common in women than in men. The condition may affect one or both ears. Risks for this condition include pregnancy and a family history of hearing loss. Caucasians are more likely to develop this condition than people of other racess"
3324,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Otosclerosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have hearing loss You develop fever, ear pain, dizziness, or other symptoms after surgery"
3325,What to expect if I have Otosclerosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Otosclerosis gets worse without treatment. Surgery may restore at least some of your hearing. Pain and dizziness from the surgery usually go away within a few weeks.
To reduce the risk of complications after surgery:
Do not blow your nose for 2 -3 weeks after surgery. Avoid people with respiratory or other infections. Avoid bending, lifting, or straining, which may cause dizziness. Avoid loud noises or sudden pressure changes, such as scuba diving, flying, or driving in the mountains until you have healed. If surgery does not work, you may have total hearing loss. Treatment then involves developing skills to cope with deafness, and using hearing aids to transmit sounds from the non-hearing ear to the good ear."
3326,What are the symptoms of Ovarian cancer?,"Early ovarian cancer does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Heavy feeling in pelvis Pain in lower abdomen Bleeding from the vagina Weight loss, loss of appetite Abnormal periods
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3327,Who is at highest risk for Ovarian cancer ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of ovarian cancer is related to several factors.
Some drugs or treatment protocols: Recent studies show that fertility drugs, androgens and estrogen replacement therapy may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Reproductive history: Clinical survey suggests that women who have had children have a lower risk of ovarian cancer than women who have no children. The risk gets even lower with each pregnancy. Personal history of breast cancer: Studies show the person who has the history of breast cancer has higher risk of developing ovarian cancer. The reason may be inherited a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Family history of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer: Clinical data show the person who has the family history of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer has higher risk of developing ovarian cancer. These may also be inherited mutated of some gene. Talcum powder: Some surveys show that talcum powder applied directly to the genital area or on sanitary napkins may increase the chance of getting ovarian cancer. Life-style: A rich- fat diet and obesity may increase the risk of getting ovarian cancer. Age: Clinical data suggest most ovarian cancers develop after menopause."
3328,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ovarian cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of ovarian cancer develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
A large amount of bleeding from the vagina"
3329,What to expect if I have Ovarian cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of ovarian cancer depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the ovaries Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred The patient’s general health"
3330,What are the symptoms of Ovarian cyst?,"Ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are typically pain or a late period.
An ovarian cyst is more likely to cause pain if it:
Becomes large Bleeds Breaks open Is bumped during sexual intercourse Is twisted or causes twisting (torsion) of the Fallopian tube
Symptoms of ovarian cysts can include:
Bloating or swelling in the abdomen Pain during bowel movements Pain in the pelvis shortly before or after beginning a menstrual period Pain with intercourse or pelvic pain during movement Pelvic pain: constant, dull aching Sudden and severe pelvic pain, often with nausea and vomiting, may be a sign of torsion or twisting of the ovary on its blood supply, or rupture of a cyst with internal bleeding
Changes in menstrual periods are not common with follicular cysts, and are more common with corpus luteum cysts. Spotting or bleeding may occur with some cysts."
3331,What causes Ovarian cyst?,"Each month during your menstrual cycle, a follicle (where the egg is developing) grows on your ovary. Most months, an egg is released from this follicle (called ovulation). If the follicle fails to break open and release an egg, the fluid stays in the follicle and forms a cyst.This is called a follicular cyst.
Another type of cyst, called a corpus luteum cyst, occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle. These often contain a small amount of blood.
Ovarian cysts are somewhat common, and are more common during a woman's childbearing years (from puberty to menopause). Ovarian cysts are less common after menopause.
No known risk factors have been found.
Functional ovarian cysts are not the same as ovarian tumors (including ovarian cancer) or cysts due to hormone-related conditions such as polycystic ovary disease.
Taking fertility drugs can cause a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation, in which multiple large cysts are formed on the ovaries. These usually go away after a woman's period, or after a pregnancy."
3332,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ovarian cyst ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of an ovarian cyst You have severe pain You have bleeding that is not normal for you
Also call for an appointment if the following symptoms have been present on most days for at least 2 weeks:
Getting full quickly when eating Losing your appetite Losing weight without trying"
3333,What to expect if I have Ovarian cyst  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cysts in women who are still having periods are more likely to go away.
There is a higher risk of cancer in women who are postmenopausal."
3334,What are the symptoms of ovarian germ cell tumor?,"Signs of ovarian germ cell tumors are
Swelling of the abdomen vaginal bleeding after menopause."
3335,What to expect if I have Ovarian germ cell tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery and treatment options)
The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:
The type of cancer The size of the tumor The stage of cancer (whether it affects part of the ovary, involves the whole ovary, or has spread to other places in the body) The way the cancer cells look under a microscope The patient’s general health Ovarian germ cell tumors are usually cured if found and treated early"
3336,What are the symptoms of Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome?,"The symptoms of OHSS can range from mild to severe.
Most women with the condition have mild symptoms such as:
Abdominal bloating Mild pain in the abdomen Weight gain
In rare cases, women can have more serious symptoms, including:
Significant weight gain (more than 10 pounds in 3 - 5 days) Severe pain or swelling in the abdomen Decreased urination Shortness of breath"
3337,What causes Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome?,"Normally, a woman produces one egg per month. Some women undergoing fertility treatments are given medicines to help normalize egg development or increase egg production.
However, if the drugs stimulate the ovaries too much, the ovaries can suddenly become very swollen and fluid can leak into the belly and chest area. This is called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS occurs only after the eggs are released from the ovary (ovulation).
You may be more likely to get OHSS if your doctor gives you an injection of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to help trigger ovulation. You may have an even greater risk of this syndrome if you receive more than one dose of hCG after ovulation and if you become pregnant during this cycle. OHSS rarely, if ever, occurs in women who only take fertility medicines by mouth.
OHSS affects up to 10% of women who go through in vitro fertilization. In most cases the condition is mild, but some women get a severe and dangerous form of OHSS.
Additional risk factors for OHSS include:
Age younger than 35 Very high estrogen level while undergoing fertility treatments Polycystic ovarian syndrome"
3338,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ?,"Call your healthcare provider if you experience any of the following symptoms:
Excessive weight gain (more than 5 pounds a day) Severe abdominal pain Nausea so intense that you can't keep food or liquids down Decreased urination Shortness of breath Dizziness"
3339,What to expect if I have Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most mild cases of OHSS will go away on their own after menstruation starts. If you have a more severe case, it can take several days for symptoms to improve. If you become pregnant during OHSS, the symptoms may get worse and can take weeks to go away."
3340,What are the symptoms of Pancreas divisum?,"Abdominal pain, usually in the mid- abdomen, that may be felt in the back Abdominal swelling (distention) Nausea or vomiting
These symptoms will only occur if you develop pancreatitis from pancreas divisum."
3341,What causes Pancreas divisum?,"Pancreas divisum is the most common birth defect of the pancreas. In many cases this defect goes undetected and causes no problems. The cause of the defect is unknown. As a baby develops in the womb, two separate pieces of tissue join together to form the pancreas. Each part has a tube, called a duct. When the parts join together, a final duct called the pancreatic duct is formed. Fluid and digestive chemicals (enzymes) produced by the pancreas normally flow through this duct.
If the ducts fail to join together while the baby is developing in the womb, pancreas divisum results. Fluid from the two parts of the pancreas drains into separate areas of the upper portion of the small intestine (duodenum).
If the pancreatic ducts become blocked, swelling and tissue damage (pancreatitis) may develop."
3342,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pancreas divisum ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.
3343,What to expect if I have Pancreas divisum  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome is usually good.
3344,What are the symptoms of Pancreatic cancer?,"Pancreatic cancer is sometimes called a ""silent disease"" because early pancreatic cancer often does not cause symptoms. But, as the cancer grows, symptoms may include:
Pain in the upper abdomen or upper back Yellow skin and eyes, and dark urine from jaundice Weakness Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Weight loss
These symptoms are not sure signs of pancreatic cancer. An infection or other problem could also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can diagnose the cause of a person's symptoms. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor so that the doctor can treat any problem as early as possible."
3345,Who is at highest risk for Pancreatic cancer ?,"No one knows the exact causes of pancreatic cancer. Doctors can seldom explain why one person gets pancreatic cancer and another does not. However, it is clear that this disease is not contagious. No one can ""catch"" cancer from another person.
Research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop pancreatic cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease.
Studies have found the following risk factors:
Age -- The likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age. Most pancreatic cancers occur in people over the age of 60. Smoking -- Cigarette smokers are two or three times more likely than nonsmokers to develop pancreatic cancer. Diabetes -- Pancreatic cancer occurs more often in people who have diabetes than in people who do not. Being male -- More men than women are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Being African American -- African Americans are more likely than Asians, Hispanics, or whites to get pancreatic cancer. Family history -- The risk for developing pancreatic cancer triples if a person's mother, father, sister, or brother had the disease. Also, a family history of colon or ovarian cancer increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis -- Chronic pancreatitis is a painful condition of the pancreas. Some evidence suggests that chronic pancreatitis may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.
Other studies suggest that exposure to certain chemicals in the workplace or a diet high in fat may increase the chance of getting pancreatic cancer.
Most people with known risk factors do not get pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, many who do get the disease have none of these factors. People who think they may be at risk for pancreatic cancer should discuss this concern with their doctor. The doctor may suggest ways to reduce the risk and can plan an appropriate schedule for checkups."
3346,How to know you have Pancreatic cancer (Diagnosis)?,"If a patient has symptoms that suggest pancreatic cancer, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history. The doctor may perform a number of procedures, including one or more of the following:
Physical exam -- The doctor examines the skin and eyes for signs of jaundice. The doctor then feels the abdomen to check for changes in the area near the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. The doctor also checks for ascites, an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen. Lab tests -- The doctor may take blood, urine, and stool samples to check for bilirubin and other substances. Bilirubin is a substance that passes from the liver to the gallbladder to the intestine. If the common bile duct is blocked by a tumor, the bilirubin cannot pass through normally. Blockage may cause the level of bilirubin in the blood, stool, or urine to become very high. High bilirubin levels can result from cancer or from noncancerous conditions. CT scan (Computed tomography) -- An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures. The x-ray machine is shaped like a donut with a large hole. The patient lies on a bed that passes through the hole. As the bed moves slowly through the hole, the machine takes many x-rays. The computer puts the x-rays together to create pictures of the pancreas and other organs and blood vessels in the abdomen. Ultrasonography -- The ultrasound device uses sound waves that cannot be heard by humans. The sound waves produce a pattern of echoes as they bounce off internal organs. The echoes create a picture of the pancreas and other organs inside the abdomen. The echoes from tumors are different from echoes made by healthy tissues.
The ultrasound procedure may use an external or internal device, or both types: Transabdominal ultrasound: To make images of the pancreas, the doctor places the ultrasound device on the abdomen and slowly moves it around. EUS (Endoscopic ultrasound): The doctor passes a thin, lighted tube (endoscope) through the patient's mouth and stomach, down into the first part of the small intestine. At the tip of the endoscope is an ultrasound device. The doctor slowly withdraws the endoscope from the intestine toward the stomach to make images of the pancreas and surrounding organs and tissues.
ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) -- The doctor passes an endoscope through the patient's mouth and stomach, down into the first part of the small intestine. The doctor slips a smaller tube (catheter) through the endoscope into the bile ducts and pancreatic ducts. After injecting dye through the catheter into the ducts, the doctor takes x-ray pictures. The x-rays can show whether the ducts are narrowed or blocked by a tumor or other condition. PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography) -- A dye is injected through a thin needle inserted through the skin into the liver. Unless there is a blockage, the dye should move freely through the bile ducts. The dye makes the bile ducts show up on x-ray pictures. From the pictures, the doctor can tell whether there is a blockage from a tumor or other condition. Biopsy -- In some cases, the doctor may remove tissue. A pathologist then uses a microscope to look for cancer cells in the tissue. The doctor may obtain tissue in several ways. One way is by inserting a needle into the pancreas to remove cells. This is called fine-needle aspiration. The doctor uses x-ray or ultrasound to guide the needle. Sometimes the doctor obtains a sample of tissue during EUS or ERCP. Another way is to open the abdomen during an operation."
3347,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pancreatic cancer ?,See your doctor immediately if you feel as though you have experienced any of the above mentioned symptoms.
3348,What are the symptoms of Panic attack?,"Panic attacks involve short periods of intense anxiety symptoms, which peak within 10 minutes.

Anyone can develop a panic disorder, but it usually starts around age 25.
Panic disorder is more common in women than men."
3350,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Panic attack ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of panic attacks.
3351,What to expect if I have Panic attack  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most patients can get better with medications or behavioral therapy. However, without early and effective help, the disorder may become more difficult to treat."
3352,What are the symptoms of Panic disorder?,"A panic attack begins suddenly, and most often peaks within 10 - 20 minutes. Some symptoms may continue for an hour or more.
A panic attack may be mistaken for a heart attack.
Panic attacks may include anxiety about being in a situation where an escape may be difficult (such as being in a crowd or traveling in a car or bus).
A person with panic disorder often lives in fear of another attack, and may be afraid to be alone or far from medical help.
People with panic disorder have at least four of the following symptoms during an attack:
Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness or faintness Fear of dying Fear of losing control or impending doom Feeling of choking Feelings of detachment Feelings of unreality Nausea or upset stomach Numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or face Palpitations, fast heart rate, or pounding heart Sensation of shortness of breath or smothering Sweating, chills, or hot flashes Trembling or shaking
Panic attacks may change behavior and function at home, school, or work. People with the disorder often worry about the effects of their panic attacks.
People with panic disorder may have symptoms of:
Alcoholism Depression Drug abuse
Panic attacks cannot be predicted. At least in the early stages of the disorder, there is no trigger that starts the attack. Recalling a past attack may trigger panic attacks."
3353,What causes Panic disorder?,"The cause is unknown.
Genetics may play a role. Studies suggest that if one identical twin has panic disorder, the other twin will also develop the condition 40% of the time. However, panic disorder often occurs when there is no family history.
Panic disorder is twice as common in women as in men. Symptoms usually begin before age 25, but may occur in the mid 30s. Although panic disorder may occur in children, it is often not diagnosed until they are older."
3354,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Panic disorder ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if panic attacks are interfering with your work, relationships, or self-esteem."
3355,What to expect if I have Panic disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Panic disorders may be long-lasting and difficult to treat. Some people with this disorder may not be cured with treatment. However, most people get better with a combination of medicine and behavioral therapy."

3372,What are the symptoms of Paranoid Schizophrenia?,"People with paranoid schizophrenia may have mistaken beliefs (delusions) that one or more people are plotting against them or their loved ones. It is difficult or impossible for others to convince them that they are not the target of a plot. People with this condition may spend a lot of time thinking about how to protect themselves from the person or people they believe are trying to harm them.
Other symptoms include:
Becoming socially isolated Feeling tense, suspicious, guarded, and reserved ""Hearing things"" (auditory hallucinations)
Paranoid schizophrenia usually does not involve the disorganized speech and behavior that is seen in other types of schizophrenia."
3373,What are the symptoms of Paraphimosis?,"The foreskin is pulled back (retracted) behind the rounded tip of the penis (glans) and stays there. The retracted foreskin and glans become swollen. This makes it difficult to return the foreskin to its extended position.

3379,What causes Parathyroid adenoma?,"The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone, which controls calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.
When calcium levels are too low, the body responds by increasing production of parathyroid hormone. This increase in parathyroid hormone causes more calcium to be taken from the bone and more calcium to be reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney. When the calcium level returns to normal, parathyroid hormone production slows down.
There are two main types of Parathyroid adenoma.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands. This leads to too much parathyroid hormone, which raises the level of calcium in the blood. The term ""hyperparathyroidism"" generally refers to primary hyperparathyroidism.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is when the body produces extra parathyroid hormone because the calcium levels are too low. This is seen when vitamin D levels are low or when calcium is not absorbed from the intestines. Correcting the calcium level and the underlying problem will bring the parathyroid levels in the normal range.
If the parathyroid glands continue to produce too much parathyroid hormone even though the calcium level is back to normal, the condition is called ""tertiary hyperthyroidism."" It occurs especially in patients with kidney problems"
3380,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Parathyroid adenoma ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.
3381,What are the symptoms of parathyroid cancer?,"Symptoms of parathyroid cancer are mainly caused by a high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), and may affect different parts of the body. They include:

3389,What are the symptoms of Parkinsonism?,"Parkinsonism refers to any condition that causes Parkinson's-type abnormal movements. Symptoms caused by Parkinsonism are the same as Parkinson's disease.
Tremor: Tremor is one of the most common signs. It often affects in a hand, arm, or leg. It occurs when the person is awake and sitting or standing still, and subsides when the person moves the affected body part. Rigidity: Muscle stiffness often occurs in the limbs and neck. Later, the patient can not move an arm or leg normally and feel pain in the limb. Decrease in facial expressions: This appearance is cause by loss of movement in the muscles in the face. Patients with Parkinsonism may feel it difficult to speak and swallow. Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement and impaired balance occur in the later in the patients with Parkinsonism. They are likely to take small steps and shuffle with the feet close together. They also have trouble in turning around and keeping balance. These abnormities may result in frequent falls. Some types of paralysis Dementia: Patients may appear progressively memory loss, losing interest in things they previously enjoyed, difficulty communicating, reading or writing, difficulty with performing tasks.

3391,How to know you have Parkinsonism?,"Tests are not usually specific for parkinsonism. However, the goal of the tests is to confirm or rule out other diseases that can cause similar symptoms.
Meidcal history, physical examination and neurological evaluation Blood tests: These tests include the check of thyroid function, liver function, kidney function, glucose levels, even the presence of any toxins. Imaging studies such as head CT (computerized axial tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and positron emission computerized tomography (PET): These images can also be used to help doctors confirm or exclude the brain disease causing Parkinsonism."
3392,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Parkinsonism ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of Parkinsonism develop.
3393,What to expect if I have Parkinsonism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of Parkinsonism depends on the underlying cause. Outcomes of Parkinsonism caused by brain tumors are poorer than other causes. If the disorder is caused by medications, it may be reversible."
3394,What are the symptoms of Parotitis?,"The symptoms of parotitis include the following:
Abnormal tastes Difficulty opening mouth Dry mouth Fever Mouth or facial pain Especially during chewing and swallowing Reddening of the face or upper neck Facial swelling Particularly in front of the ears"
3395,What causes Parotitis?,"The causes of Parotitis include viruses such as mumps, HIV, or extrapulmonary tuberculosis. It can also result from a staph infection from staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Parotitis can result from blockages in the mouth, including benign or malignant tumors or salivary gland stones. A chronic disease that can cause parotitis is Sjögren's Syndrome."
3396,Who is at highest risk for Parotitis ?,"Children between 6 months and 16 years old for mumps -based parotitis. Women over age 40 and/or perimenopausal, for parotitis from Sjögren’s syndrome.

3403,What causes Head lice?,"Head lice infect hair on the head. Tiny eggs on the hair look like flakes of dandruff. However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay put. Head lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks. Head lice spread easily, particularly among school children. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions. You can get head lice if you:
Come in close contact with a person who has lice Touch the clothing or bedding of someone who has lice Share hats, towels, brushes, or combs of someone who has had lice
Having head lice does NOT mean the person has poor hygiene or low social status. Having head lice causes intense itching, but does not lead to serious medical problems. Unlike body lice, head lice never carry or spread diseases."

Note: There may be no symptoms. People who experience an ectopic pregnancy or infertility often have had silent PID, which is usually caused by chlamydia infection."
3408,What causes Pelvic inflammatory disease?,"Most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease are caused by bacteria that move from the vagina or cervix into the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or pelvis. The most common cause of PID is sexual contact without using a condom or other protection. This is called a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the two bacteria that cause most cases of PID. However, bacteria may also enter the body during some surgical or office procedures, such as:
Childbirth Endometrial biopsy Insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) Miscarriage Therapeutic or elective abortion

Note: Early symptoms resemble gingivitis."
3417,What causes Periodontitis?,"Periodontitis occurs when inflammation or infection of the gums (gingivitis) is untreated or treatment is delayed. Infection and inflammation spreads from the gums (gingiva) to the ligaments and bone that support the teeth. Loss of support causes the teeth to become loose and eventually fall out. Periodontitis is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults. This disorder is uncommon in childhood but increases during adolescence.
Plaque and tartar build up at the base of the teeth. Inflammation causes a pocket to develop between the gums and the teeth, which fills with plaque and tartar. Soft tissue swelling traps the plaque in the pocket. Continued inflammation leads to damage of the tissues and bone surrounding the tooth. Because plaque contains bacteria, infection is likely and a tooth abscess may also develop, which increases the rate of bone destruction."
3418,Who is at highest risk for Periodontitis ?,"One of the most predominant risk factors of periodontal disease is tobacco use. Another very strong risk factor is one's genetic susceptibility. Several conditions and diseases, including Down syndrome, diabetes, and other diseases that affect one's resistance to infection also increase susceptibility to periodontitis."
3419,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Periodontitis ?,Consult your dentist if signs of gum disease are present.
3420,What to expect if I have Periodontitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some people find the removal of dental plaque from inflamed gums to be uncomfortable. Bleeding and tenderness of the gums should go away within 1 or 2 weeks of treatment. (Healthy gums are pink and firm in appearance.)
You need to follow careful oral hygiene for your entire life or the disorder may return."
3421,What are the symptoms of Peripheral neuropathy?,"Symptoms depend on the nerve that is damaged. Symptoms also depend on whether the damage affects one nerve, several nerves, or the whole body.
Pain and Numbness
Tingling or burning in the arms and legs may be an early sign of nerve damage. These feelings often start in your toes and feet. You may have deep pain. This often happens in the feet and legs. You may lose feeling in your legs and arms. Because of this, you may not notice when you step on something sharp. You may not notice when touch something that is too hot or cold, like the water in a bathtub. You may not know when you have a small blister or sore on your feet.
Muscle Problems
Damage to the nerves can make it harder to control muscles. It can also cause weakness. You may notice problems moving a part of your body. You may fall because your legs buckle. You may trip over your toes. Doing tasks such as buttoning a shirt may be harder. You may also notice your muscles twitch or cramp. Your muscles may become smaller.
Problems with Body Organs
People with nerve damage may have problems digesting food. You may feel full or bloated and have heartburn after eating only a little food. Sometimes you may vomit food that has not been digested well. You may have either loose stools or hard stools. Some people have problems swallowing. Damage to the nerves to your heart may cause you to feel lightheaded, or faint, when you stand up. Angina is the warning chest pain for heart disease and heart attack. Nerve damage may ""hide"" this warning sign. You should learn other warning signs of a heart attack. They are sudden fatigue, sweating, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting.
Other Symptoms of Nerve Damage
Sexual problems. Men may have problems with erections. Women may have trouble with vaginal dryness or orgasm. Some people may not be able to tell when their blood sugar gets too low. Bladder problems. You may leak urine. You may not be able to tell when your bladder is full. Some people are not able to empty their bladder. You may sweat too much. This may happen when the temperature is cool, when you are at rest, or at other unusual times."
3422,What causes Peripheral neuropathy?,"Neuropathy is very common. There are many types and causes. Often, no cause can be found. Some nerves diseases run in families. Diabetes is the most common cause of this type of nerve problem. High blood sugar levels over a long time can damage your nerves.
Other health conditions that may cause neuropathy are:
Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus Chronic kidney disease HIV Liver infections Low levels of vitamin B12 Metabolic disease Poisoning due to heavy metals, such as lead Poor blood flow to the legs Underactive thyroid gland
Other things that can lead to nerve damage are:
Broken bone that affects a nerve Long-term, heavy alcohol use Glue, lead, mercury, and solvent poisoning Drugs that treat infections, cancer, seizures, and high blood pressure Pressure on a nerve, such as carpal tunnel syndrome Being exposed to cold temperatures for a long period of time Pressure from bad-fitting casts, splints, a brace, or crutches"
3423,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Peripheral neuropathy ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of nerve damage. Early treatment increases the chance of controlling symptoms and preventing more problems.
3424,What to expect if I have Peripheral neuropathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well you do depends on the cause of nerve damage. Some nerve-related problems do not interfere with daily life. Others get worse quickly and may lead to long-term, severe symptoms and problems. When a medical condition can be found and treated, your outlook may be excellent. But sometimes, nerve damage can be permanent, even if the cause is treated. Long-term (chronic) pain can be a major problem for some patients. Numbness in the feet can lead to skin sores that do not heal. Rarely, numbness in the feet may lead to amputation. There is no cure for most neuropathies passed down in families."
3425,What are the symptoms of Pernicious anemia?,"People with mild anemia may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. More typical symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia include:
Diarrhea or constipation Fatigue, lack of energy, or light-headedness when standing up or with exertion Loss of appetite Pale skin Problems concentrating Shortness of breath, mostly during exercise Swollen, red tongue or bleeding gums Nerve damage caused by vitamin B12 deficiency that has been present for a longer time may cause:
Confusion or change in mental status (dementia) in severe or advanced cases Depression Loss of balance Numbness and tingling of hands and feet"
3426,What causes Pernicious anemia?,"The body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. To provide vitamin B12 to your blood cells, you need to eat enough foods containing vitamin B12, such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. To absorb vitamin B12, your body uses a special protein called intrinsic factor, which is released by cells in the stomach. The combination of vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor is absorbed in the last part of the small intestine.
When the stomach does not make enough intrinsic factor, the intestine cannot properly absorb vitamin B12.
Very rarely, infants and children are born without the ability to produce enough intrinsic factor, or the ability to absorb the combination of intrinsic factor and vitamin B12 in the small intestine. Pernicious anemia that occurs at birth (congenital) is inherited. You need the defective gene from each parent to get it.
Common causes of pernicious anemia include:
Weakened stomach lining (atrophic gastritis) The body's immune system attacking the cells that make intrinsic factor (autoimmunity against gastric parietal cells) or intrinsic factor itself
The disease begins slowly and may take decades to fully establish. Although the congenital form occurs in children, pernicious anemia usually does not appear before age 30 in adults. The average age at diagnosis is 60."
3427,Who is at highest risk for Pernicious anemia ?,"Risk factors include:
Family history of the disease History of autoimmune endocrine disorders, including:
Addison's disease Chronic thyroiditis Graves disease Hypoparathyroidism Hypopituitarism Myasthenia gravis Secondary amenorrhea Type 1 diabetes Testicular dysfunction Vitiligo Scandinavian or Northern European descent"
3428,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pernicious anemia ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.
3429,What to expect if I have Pernicious anemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually excellent with treatment.
Any damage to nerves may be permanent, especially if treatment is not started within 6 months of when symptoms began."
3430,What are the symptoms of Pertussis?,"Pertussis can cause serious illness in infants, children and adults. The disease starts like the common cold, with runny nose or congestion, sneezing, and maybe mild cough or fever. But after 1–2 weeks, severe coughing begins. Infants and children with the disease cough violently and rapidly, over and over, until the air is gone from their lungs and they're forced to inhale with a loud ""whooping"" sound. Pertussis is most severe for babies; more than half of infants less than 1 year of age who get the disease must be hospitalized. About 1 in 20 infants with pertussis get pneumonia (lung infection), and about 1 in 100 will have convulsions. In rare cases, pertussis can be deadly, especially in infants."
3431,What causes Pertussis?,"People with pertussis usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the pertussis bacteria. Many infants who get pertussis are infected by parents, older siblings, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease."
3432,Who is at highest risk for Pertussis ?,"As noted above, Pertussis much more serious for babies and infants, often requiring hospitalization."
3433,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pertussis ?,"When you or your child develops a cold that includes a prolonged or severe cough, it may be pertussis. The best way to know is to contact your doctor."
3434,What to expect if I have Pertussis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Pertussis can be prevented if the child is properly vaccinated for it. It's especially dangerous in infants. The coughing spells can be so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink or breathe. Before there was a vaccine, whooping cough was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood deaths in the U.S. There are fewer cases today because there are both pertussis-only vaccines and combination vaccines for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. If you have whooping cough, treatment with antibiotics may help if given early."
3435,What are the symptoms of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,"Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Cough Coughing up blood Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks Neck pain Sore throat that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks, even with antibiotics Swelling or lumps in the neck Unintentional weight loss"
3436,What causes Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Excessive alcohol use also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancers.
3437,Who is at highest risk for Pharyngeal cancer ?,Most cancers of the throat develop in adults older than 50. Men are 10 times more likely than women to develop throat cancers.
3438,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pharyngeal cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of throat cancer, especially hoarseness or a change in voice with no obvious cause that lasts longer than 3 weeks You find a lump in your neck that does not go away in 2 - 3 weeks"
3439,What to expect if I have Pharyngeal cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Throat cancers can be cured in 90% of patients if detected early. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, 50 - 60% of patients can be cured. If the cancer has spread (metastasized) to parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable and treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life.
After treatment, patients generally need therapy to help with speech and swallowing. A small percentage of patients (5%) will not be able to swallow and will need to be fed through a feeding tube."
3440,What are the symptoms of Pharyngitis?,"The main symptom is a sore throat.
Other symptoms may include:
Fever Headache Joint pain and muscle aches Skin rashes Swollen lymph nodes in the neck"
3441,What are the causes of Pharyngitis?,"Many germs can cause pharyngitis.
Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis. Many different viruses can cause pharyngitis. Bacteria that can cause pharyngitis include Group A streptococcus, which leads to strep throat in some cases. Other, less-common bacteria that cause sore throats include corynebacterium, arcanobacterium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.
Most cases of pharyngitis occur during the colder months. The illness often spreads among family members."
3442,Who is at highest risk for Pharyngitis ?,"Pharyngitis is contagious, so anyone in close proximity to someone with the illness, is at risk."
3443,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pharyngitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop a sore throat that does not go away after several days You have a high fever, swollen lymph nodes in your neck, or a rash"
3444,What to expect if I have Pharyngitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most cases of pharyngitis go away on their own without complications.
3445,What are the symptoms of Phobia?,"Being exposed to the feared object, or even thinking about being exposed to it causes an anxiety reaction.
This fear or anxiety is out of proportion to (much stronger than) the real threat. The person may have excessive sweating, problems controlling the muscles or actions, or rapid heart rate.
The person avoids situations in which contact with the feared object or animal may occur. For example, avoiding driving through tunnels, if tunnels are the subject of the phobia. This type of avoidance can interfere with job and social functioning.
The person may feel weak or cowardly and lose self-esteem when avoiding the object of the phobia."
3446,What causes Phobia?,"Specific phobias are a type of anxiety disorder in which exposure to the feared stimulus may provoke extreme anxiety or a panic attack. Specific phobias are among the most common of all psychiatric disorders, affecting up to 10% of the population.
Common phobias include the fear of:
Blood, injections, and other medical procedures Certain animals (for instance, dogs or snakes) Enclosed spaces Flying High places Insects or spiders Lightning"
3447,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Phobia ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider or a mental health professional if a simple phobia is interfering with life activities.
3448,What to expect if I have Phobia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Phobias tend to be chronic, but they can respond to treatment."
3449,What are the symptoms of Pica?,"Children and adults with pica may eat:
Animal feces Clay Dirt Hairballs Ice Paint Sand
This pattern of eating should last at least 1 month to fit the diagnosis of pica."
3450,What causes Pica?,"Pica is seen more in young children than adults. Between 10 and 32% of children ages 1 - 6 have these behaviors.
Pica can occur during pregnancy.
In some cases, conditions due to a lack of certain nutrients, such as iron deficiency anemia and zinc deficiency, may trigger the unusual cravings.
Pica may also occur in adults who crave a certain texture in their mouth."
3451,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pica ?,Call your health care provider if you notice that a child (or adult) often eats non-food materials.
3452,What to expect if I have Pica  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treatment success varies. In many cases, the disorder lasts several months, then disappears on its own.
In some cases, it may continue into the teen years or adulthood, especially when it occurs with developmental disorders."
3453,What are the symptoms of Pick's disease?,"The disease gets worse slowly. Tissues in the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain start to shrink over time.
Symptoms such as behavior changes, speech difficulty, and impaired thinking occur slowly, but continue to get worse.
The early personality changes can help doctors tell Pick's disease apart from Alzheimer’s. Memory loss is often the main, and earliest, symptom of Alzheimer's.
People with Pick's disease tend to behave the wrong way in different social settings. The changes in behavior continue to get worse and are often one of the most disturbing symptoms of the disease. Some patients will have more prominent difficulty with decision making, complex tasks, or language (trouble finding or understanding words or writing).
General symptoms are listed below.
Behavioral changes: Can't keep a job Compulsive behaviors Inappropriate behavior Inability to function or interact in social or personal situations Problems with personal hygiene Repetitive behavior Withdrawal from social interaction
Emotional changes: Abrupt mood changes Decreased interest in daily living activities Failure to recognize changes in behavior Failure to show emotional warmth, concern, empathy, sympathy Inappropriate mood Not caring about events or environment
Language changes: Can't speak (mutism) Decreased ability to read or write Difficulty finding a word Difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia) Repeat anything spoken to them (echolalia) Shrinking vocabulary Weak, uncoordinated speech sounds
Neurological problems: Increased muscle tone (rigidity) Memory loss that gets worse Movement/coordination difficulties (apraxia) Weakness
Other problems: Urinary incontinence"
3454,What causes Pick's disease?,"People with Pick's disease have abnormal substances (called Pick bodies and Pick cells) inside nerve cells in the damaged areas of the brain.
Pick bodies and Pick cells contain an abnormal form of a protein called tau. This protein is found in all nerve cells. But some people with Pick's disease have an abnormal amount or type of this protein.
The exact cause of the abnormal form of the protein is unknown. Many different abnormal genes have been found that can cause Pick’s disease. Many cases of Pick's disease are passed down through families.
Pick's disease is rare. It can occur in people as young as 20, but usually begins between ages 40 and 60. The average age at which it begins is 54."
3455,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pick%27s disease ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of Pick's disease.
Call your health care provider or go to the emergency room if mental function gets worse (which may mean that another disorder has developed)."
3456,What to expect if I have Pick%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The disorder quickly and steadily becomes worse.
Patients become totally disabled early in the course of the disease.
Pick's disease commonly causes death within 2 - 10 years, usually from infection but sometimes from general failure of the body systems."
3457,What are the symptoms of pinguecula?,"A pinguecula is a small, yellowish nodule on the conjunctiva near the cornea. It can appear on either side of the cornea, but usually appears on the nasal side. It may increase in size over many years."
3458,What are the causes of pinguecula?,"The cause is unknown, but chronic sunlight exposure and eye irritation may contribute to its development."
3459,Who is at highest risk for Pinguecula ?,"People who are exposed to a great deal of sunlight (and consequently UV light), who live in tropical climates, and who suffer from eye irritation are at an increased risk of pinguecula. Certain occupations that may potentially damage the eyes, such as welding, also increase the risk."
3460,How to know you have pinguecula?,"An eye examination is often enough to diagnose this disorder. It is to be distinguished clinically from pterygium, which is a wedge shaped area of fibrosis that appears to grow into the cornea."
3461,What are the symptoms of Pituitary apoplexy ?,"Pituitary infarction usually has a short period of symptoms (acute), but it can be life-threatening.
Symptoms usually include:
Severe headache Paralysis of the eye muscles (ophthalmoplegia) causing double vision Low blood pressure, nausea, and vomiting from acute adrenal insufficiency
Less commonly, pituitary dysfunction may appear more slowly. In Sheehan syndrome, for example, the first symptom may be a failure to produce milk caused by a lack of the hormone prolactin.
Over time, problems with other pituitary hormones may develop, causing symptoms of the following conditions:
Growth hormone deficiency Fatigue Increased fat in the abdomen Lack of energy Hypoadrenalism (if not already present or treated) Inability to deal with physical stress Nausea Hypogonadism Absent periods (amenorrhea) in women Sexual dysfunction and loss of muscle mass in men Hypothyroidism Cold intolerance Constipation Depressed mood Dry skin Fatigue Hair or skin changes Hoarseness Menstrual changes Mental slowing Weight gain
When the posterior pituitary is involved (rare), symptoms may include:
Failure of the uterus to contract as needed to give birth to a baby (in women) Failure to produce breast milk (in women) Uncontrolled urination"
3462,What are the causes of Pituitary apoplexy ?,"Pituitary infarction is most commonly caused by bleeding due to a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary. When this bleeding occurs in a woman during or immediately after childbirth, it is called Sheehan syndrome."
3463,Who is at highest risk for Pituitary apoplexy ?,"Risk factors for pituitary infarction include:
Bleeding disorders Diabetes Head injury Radiation to the pituitary gland Use of a breathing machine"
3464,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pituitary apoplexy ?,"Call your health care provider if you have any symptoms of chronic pituitary insufficiency.
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of acute pituitary infarction, including:
Eye weakness Headache Low blood pressure (which can cause fainting) Nausea Vomiting
Be especially concerned if you develop these symptoms and you have already been diagnosed with a pituitary tumor."
3465,What to expect if I have Pituitary apoplexy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Acute pituitary infarction can be life-threatening. The outlook is good for people who have chronic deficiency that is diagnosed and treated.
3466,What are the symptoms of Placenta previa?,"The main symptom of placenta previa is sudden, painless vaginal bleeding that often occurs near the end of the second trimester or beginning of the third trimester.
In some cases, there is severe bleeding, or hemorrhage. The bleeding may stop on its own but can start again days or weeks later.
There may be uterine cramping with the bleeding.
Labor sometimes starts within several days after heavy vaginal bleeding. However, in some cases, bleeding may not occur until after labor starts."
3467,What causes Placenta previa?,"During pregnancy, the placenta moves as the uterus stretches and grows. In early pregnancy, a low-lying placenta is very common. But as the pregnancy progresses, the growing uterus should ""pull"" the placenta toward the top of the womb. By the third trimester, the placenta should be near the top of the uterus, leaving the opening of the cervix clear for the delivery.
Sometimes, though, the placenta remains in the lower portion of the uterus, partly or completely covering this opening. This is called a previa.
There are different forms of placenta previa:
Marginal: The placenta is against the cervix but does not cover the opening. Partial: The placenta covers part of the cervical opening. Complete: The placenta completely covers the cervical opening.
Placenta previa occurs in 1 out of 200 pregnancies.
It is more common in women who have:
Abnormally developed uterus Many previous pregnancies Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.) Scarring of the uterine wall caused by previous pregnancies, cesareans, uterine surgery, or abortions
Women who smoke or have their children at an older age may also have an increased risk.
Possible causes of placenta previa include:
Abnormal formation of the placenta Abnormal uterus Large placenta Scarred lining of the uterus (endometrium)"
3468,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Placenta previa ?,"Call your health care provider if you have bleeding from the vagina at any point in your pregnancy.
Placenta previa can be dangerous to both you and your baby."
3469,What to expect if I have Placenta previa  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Placenta previa is most often diagnosed before bleeding occurs. Careful monitoring of the mother and unborn baby can prevent many of the significant dangers.
The biggest risk is that severe bleeding will require your baby to be delivered early, before major organs, such as the lungs, have developed.
Most complications can be avoided by hospitalizing a mother who is having symptoms, and delivering by C-section."
3470,What are the symptoms of Placental abruption ?,Abdominal pain Back pain Frequent uterine contractions Uterine contractions with no relaxation in between Vaginal bleeding
3471,What are the causes of Placental abruption ?,"The exact cause of a placental abruption may be hard to determine.
Direct causes are rare, but include:
Injury to the belly area (abdomen) from a fall, hit to the abdomen, or automobile accident Sudden loss of uterine volume (can occur with rapid loss of amniotic fluid or after a first twin is delivered)
Placental abruption, which includes any amount of placental separation before delivery, occurs in about 1 out of 150 deliveries. The severe form, which can cause the baby to die, occurs only in about 1 out of 800 to 1,600 deliveries."
3472,Who is at highest risk for Placental abruption ?,"Risk factors include:
Blood clotting disorders (thrombophilias) Cigarette smoking Cocaine use Diabetes Drinking more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week during pregnancy High blood pressure during pregnancy (about half of placental abruptions that lead to the baby's death are linked to high blood pressure) History of placenta abruptio Increased uterine distention (may occur with multiple pregnancies or very large volume of amniotic fluid) Large number of past deliveries Older mother Premature rupture of membranes (the bag of water breaks before 37 weeks into the pregnancy) Uterine fibroids"
3473,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Placental abruption ?,"Call your health care provider if you are in an auto accident, even if the accident is minor.
Call your doctor right away if you have bleeding during pregnancy.
See your health care provider right away, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or go to the emergency room if you are pregnant and have vaginal bleeding and severe abdominal pain or contractions during your pregnancy.
Placental abruption can quickly become an emergency condition that threatens the life of both the mother and baby."
3474,What to expect if I have Placental abruption  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The mother does not usually die from this condition.
However, all of the following increase the risk for death in both the mother and baby:
Closed cervix Delayed diagnosis and treatment of placental abruption Excessive blood loss, leading to shock Hidden (concealed) uterine bleeding in pregnancy No labor
Fetal distress occurs early in the condition in about half of all cases.
Infants who live have a 40-50% chance of complications, which range from mild to severe."
3475,What are the symptoms of Pleurisy ?,"The main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest. This pain most likely occurs when you take a deep breath in or out, or cough. Some people feel the pain in the shoulder.
Deep breathing, coughing, and chest movement makes the pain worse.
Pleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest cavity. This can make breathing difficult and may cause the following symptoms:
Bluish skin color (cyanosis)
Coughing
Shortness of breath
Rapid breathing (tachypnea)"
3476,What are the causes of Pleurisy ?,"Pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. It is often a sign of a viral infection of the lungs. This inflammation also causes the sharp chest pain of pleurisy.
It may also occur with:
Asbestos-related disease Certain cancers Chest trauma Pulmonary embolus Rheumatic diseases"
3477,Who is at highest risk for Pleurisy ?,"If you have an underlying lung disease, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, you are at a higher risk for pleurisy."
3478,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pleurisy ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of pleurisy. If you have breathing difficulty or your skin turns blue, seek immediate medical care."
3479,What to expect if I have Pleurisy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Recovery depends on what is causing the pleurisy.
3480,What are the symptoms of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia?,"Pneumocystis pneumonia in those with AIDS usually develops slowly over days to weeks or even months, and is less severe. People with pneumocystis pneumonia who do not have AIDS usually get sick faster and are more acutely ill. Symptoms include:
Cough -- often mild and dry Fever Rapid breathing Shortness of breath -- especially with activity (exertion)"
3481,What causes Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia?,"This type of pneumonia is caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci. This fungus is common in the environment and does not cause illness in healthy people. However, it can cause a lung infection in people with a weakened immune system due to:
Cancer Chronic use of corticosteroids or other medications that weaken the immune system HIV/AIDS Organ or bone marrow transplant
Pneumocystis jiroveci was a relatively rare infection before the AIDS epidemic. Before the use of preventive antibiotics for the condition, most people in the United States with advanced AIDS would develop it."
3482,Who is at highest risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ?,"This type of pneumonia is caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci. This fungus is common in the environment and does not cause illness in healthy people. However, it can cause a lung infection in people with a weakened immune system due to:
Cancer Chronic use of corticosteroids or other medications that weaken the immune system HIV/AIDS Organ or bone marrow transplant"
3483,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ?,If you feel you are developing symptoms suggestive of Pneumocystis pneumonia contact your health professional.
3484,What to expect if I have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Pneumocystis pneumonia can be life threatening, causing respiratory failure that can lead to death. People with this condition need early and effective treatment. For moderate to severe pneumocystis pneumonia in people with AIDS, the short term use of corticosteroids has decreased death."
3485,What are the symptoms of Pneumonia?,"The most common symptoms of pneumonia are:
Cough (with some pneumonias you may cough up greenish or yellow mucus, or even bloody mucus) Fever, which may be mild or high Shaking chills Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs)
Additional symptoms include:
Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough Headache Excessive sweating and clammy skin Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue Confusion, especially in older people"
3486,What causes Pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is a common illness that affects millions of people each year in the United States. Germs called bacteria, viruses, and fungi may cause pneumonia.
Ways you can get pneumonia include:
Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to your lungs. You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs. You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or secretions from the mouth into your lungs (aspiration pneumonia)
Pneumonia caused by bacteria tends to be the most serious. In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.
The most common pneumonia-causing germ in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Atypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is sometimes seen in people whose immune system is impaired (due to AIDS or certain medications that suppress the immune system). Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae are other bacteria that can cause pneumonia. Tuberculosis can cause pneumonia in some people, especially those with a weak immune system.
Viruses are also a common cause of pneumonia, especially in infants and young children.

3487,Who is at highest risk for Pneumonia ?,"Risk factors (conditions that increase your chances of getting pneumonia) include:
Cigarette smoking Recent viral respiratory infection (common cold, laryngitis, influenza) Difficulty swallowing (due to stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, or other neurological conditions) Chronic lung disease (COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis) Cerebral palsy Other serious illnesses, such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus Living in a nursing facility Impaired consciousness (loss of brain function due to dementia, stroke, or other neurologic conditions) Recent surgery or trauma Immune system problem"
3488,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pneumonia ?,"Call your doctor if you have:
Worsening respiratory symptoms Shortness of breath, shaking chills, or persistent fevers Rapid or painful breathing A cough that brings up bloody or rust-colored mucus Chest pain that worsens when you cough or inhale Night sweats or unexplained weight loss Signs of pneumonia and weak immune system, as with HIV or chemotherapy
Infants with pneumonia may not have a cough. Call your doctor if your infant makes grunting noises or the area below the rib cage is retracting while breathing."
3489,What to expect if I have Pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, most patients will improve within 2 weeks. Elderly or debilitated patients may need longer treatment.
Those who may be more likely to have complicated pneumonia include:
Older adults or very young children People whose immune system does not work well People with other, serious medical problems such as diabetes or cirrhosis of the liver
Your doctor may want to make sure your chest x-ray becomes normal again after you take a course of antibiotics. However, it may take many weeks for your x-ray to clear up."
3490,What are the symptoms of Pneumothorax?,"Almost everyone who has a collapsed lung has the following symptoms:
Sharp chest pain, made worse by a deep breath or a cough Shortness of breath
A larger pneumothorax will cause more severe symptoms, including:
Chest tightness Easy fatigue Rapid heart rate Bluish color of the skin caused by lack of oxygen
Symptoms may begin during rest or sleep.
Other symptoms that can occur with a collapsed lung include:
Nasal flaring Low blood pressure (hypotension)"
3491,What causes Pneumothorax?,"A collapsed lung may result from chest trauma, such as gunshot or knife wounds, rib fracture, or after certain medical procedures.
In some cases, a collapsed lung occurs without any cause. This is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. A small area in the lung that is filled with air, called a bleb, ruptures, and the air leaks into the space around the lung.
Certain activities may lead to a collapsed lung. These include scuba diving, smoking marijuana or cigarettes, high altitude hiking, and flying."
3492,Who is at highest risk for Pneumothorax?,"Tall, thin people are more likely to develop a collapsed lung.
Lung diseases such as COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, and whooping cough also increase your risk for a collapsed lung."
3493,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pneumothorax ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of a collapsed lung, especially if you have had one before."
3494,What to expect if I have Pneumothorax  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If you have a collapsed lung, you are more likely to have another one in the future if you:
Are tall and thin Continue to smoke Have had two collapsed lungs in the past
How well a person does after having a collapsed lung depends on what caused it."
3495,What are the symptoms of Polio?,"There are three basic patterns of polio infection: subclinical infections, nonparalytic, and paralytic. Approximately 95% of infections are subclinical infections, which may not have symptoms.
General discomfort or uneasiness (malaise) Headache Red throat Slight fever Sore throat Vomiting
People with subclinical polio infection might not have symptoms, or these may last 72 hours or less. Clinical poliomyelitis affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and is divided into nonparalytic and paralytic forms. It may occur after recovery from a subclinical infection.
Back pain or backache Diarrhea Excessive tiredness, fatigue Headache Irritability Leg pain (calf muscles) Moderate fever Muscle stiffness Muscle tenderness and spasm in any area of the body Neck pain and stiffness Pain in the front part of neck Pain or stiffness of the back, arms, legs, abdomen Skin rash or lesion with pain Vomiting
Symptoms usually last 1 - 2 weeks.
Fever 5 - 7 days before other symptoms Abnormal sensations (but not loss of sensation) in an area Bloated feeling in abdomen Breathing difficulty Constipation Difficulty beginning to urinate Drooling Headache Irritability or poor temper control Muscle contractions or muscle spasms in the calf, neck, or back Muscle pain Muscle weakness, asymmetrical (only on one side or worse on one side) Comes on quickly Location depends on where the spinal cord is affected Worsens into paralysis Sensitivity to touch; mild touch may be painful Stiff neck and back Swallowing difficulty"
3496,What causes Polio?,"Poliomyelitis is a disease caused by infection with the poliovirus. The virus spreads by direct person-to-person contact, by contact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth, or by contact with infected feces.
The virus enters through the mouth and nose, multiplies in the throat and intestinal tract, and then is absorbed and spread through the blood and lymphatic system. The time from being infected with the virus to developing symptoms of disease (incubation) ranges from 5 - 35 days (average 7 - 14 days)."
3497,Who is at highest risk for Polio ?,"Person's at higher risk include those who:
Lack immunization against polio and are exposed to the virus Travel to an area that has experienced a polio outbreak
In areas where there is an outbreak, those most likely to get the disease include children, pregnant women, and the elderly. The disease is more common in the summer and fall. Between 1840 and the 1950s, polio was a worldwide epidemic. Since the development of polio vaccines, the incidence of the disease has been greatly reduced. Polio has been wiped out in a number of countries. There have been very few cases of polio in the Western hemisphere since the late 1970s. Children in the United States are now routinely vaccinated against the disease. Outbreaks still occur in the developed world, usually in groups of people who have not been vaccinated. Polio often occurs after someone travels to a region where the disease is common. Thanks to a massive, global, vaccination campaign over the past 20 years, polio exists only in a few countries in Africa and Asia."
3498,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Polio ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Someone close to you has developed poliomyelitis and you haven't been vaccinated You develop symptoms of poliomyelitis Your child's polio immunization (vaccine) is not up to date"
3499,What to expect if I have Polio  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"What to expect depends on the form of the disease (subclinical, nonparalytic, or paralytic) and the site affected. If the spinal cord and brain are not involved, which is the case more than 90% of the time, complete recovery is likely. Brain or spinal cord involvement is a medical emergency that may result in paralysis or death (usually from respiratory difficulties). Disability is more common than death. Infection high in the spinal cord or in the brain increases the risk of breathing problems."
3500,What are the symptoms of Polycystic ovary syndrome?,"Not all women with PCOS share the same symptoms. These are some of the symptoms of PCOS:
Infrequent menstrual periods, no menstrual periods, and/or irregular bleeding Infertility due to a lack of ovulation Increased hair growth on the face, chest, stomach, back, thumbs, or toes (hirsutism) Ovarian cysts Acne, oily skin, or dandruff Weight gain or obesity, usually carrying extra weight around the waist Insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes High cholesterol Hypertension Male-pattern baldness or thinning hair Patches of thickened and dark brown or black skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighs Skin tags, or tiny excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area Pelvic pain Anxiety or depression due to appearance and/or infertility Sleep apnea (excessive snoring and times when breathing stops while asleep)"
3501,What causes Polycystic ovary syndrome?,"The cause of PCOS is unknown. Most researchers think that more than one factor could play a role in developing PCOS. Genes are thought to be one factor. Women with PCOS tend to have a mother or sister with PCOS. Researchers also think insulin could be linked to PCOS. Insulin is a hormone that controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body to use or store. For many women with PCOS, their bodies have problems using insulin so that too much insulin is in the body. Excess insulin appears to increase production of androgen. This hormone is made in fat cells, the ovaries, and the adrenal gland. Levels of androgen that are higher than normal can lead to acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and problems with ovulation.
<figure-inline class=""mw-default-size""> </figure-inline>
What causes the symptoms of PCOS? The ovaries are two small organs, one on each side of a woman's uterus. A woman's ovaries have follicles, which are tiny sacs filled with liquid that hold the eggs. These sacs also are called cysts. Each month about 20 eggs start to mature, but usually only one matures fully. As this one egg grows, the follicle accumulates fluid in it. When that egg matures, the follicle breaks open to release it. The egg then travels through the fallopian tube for fertilization. When the single egg leaves the follicle, ovulation takes place.
In women with PCOS, the ovary doesn't make all of the hormones it needs for any of the eggs to fully mature. Follicles may start to grow and build up fluid. But no one follicle becomes large enough. Instead, some follicles may remain as cysts. Since no follicle becomes large enough and no egg matures or is released, ovulation does not occur and the hormone progesterone is not made. Without progesterone, a woman's menstrual cycle is irregular or absent. Plus, the cysts make male hormones, which also prevent ovulation."
3502,Who is at highest risk for Polycystic ovary syndrome ?,"About one in ten women of childbearing age has PCOS, and it can occur in girls as young as 11 years old. In addition, most researchers think that PCOS runs in families. Women with PCOS tend to have a mother or sister with PCOS."
3503,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Polycystic ovary syndrome ?,"Talk with your doctor if you have irregular, scant or no menstrual periods, are overweight, and have acne or excess facial hair growth.
It appears to be higher rates of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (pre-eclampsia), and premature delivery in women with PCOS. Researchers are studying how the diabetes medicine metformin can prevent or reduce the chances of having these problems while pregnant.
Women with PCOS have greater chances of developing several serious, life-threatening diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Recent studies found that:
More than 50 percent of women with PCOS will have diabetes or pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance) before the age of 40. Women with PCOS have a four to seven times higher risk of heart attack than women of the same age without PCOS. Women with PCOS are at greater risk of having hypertension. Women with PCOS have high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol.
The chance of getting endometrial cancer is another concern for women with PCOS. Irregular menstrual periods and the absence of ovulation cause women to produce the hormone estrogen, but not the hormone progesterone. Progesterone causes the endometrium to shed its lining each month as a menstrual period. Without progesterone, the endometrium becomes thick, which can cause heavy bleeding or irregular bleeding. Over time, this can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, when the lining grows too much, and cancer."
3504,What to expect if I have Polycystic ovary syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Getting your symptoms under control at an earlier age can help to reduce your chances of having complications like diabetes and heart diseases. Talk to your doctor about treating all your symptoms, rather than focusing on just one aspect of your PCOS, such as problems getting pregnant. Also, talk to our doctor about getting tested for diabetes regularly. Eating right, exercising, and not smoking also will help to reduce your chances of having other health problems."
3505,What causes Polyhydramnios?,"Polyhydramnios can occur if the fetus does not swallow and absorb amniotic fluid in normal amounts. This can happen due to:
Gastrointestinal disorders, such as duodenal atresia, esophageal atresia, gastroschisis, and diaphragmatic hernia Brain and nervous system (neurological) problems, such as anencephaly and myotonic dystrophy A variety of other causes, such as poorly controlled diabetes, achondroplasia, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
Polyhydramnios may also be related to increased fluid production, which occurs with:
Certain fetal lung disorders Multiple gestation (for example, twins or triplets) Hydrops fetalis
Sometimes, no specific cause for polyhydramnios is found."
3506,What are the symptoms of Portal hypertension?,"Symptoms of portal hypertension include:
Bloody vomiting Tarry stools Abdominal distention Fatigue Loss of appetite
Abdominal pain Confusion Forgetfulness Drowsiness Slurred speech Bleeding easily Easy bruising Itchy skin Jaundice Nausea Peripheral swelling Weight loss Palms Redness Testicular shrinkage in men Breast enlargement in men Bloody stool"
3507,What causes Portal hypertension?,"Common causes of portal hypertension include:
Bacterial intestinal infections Congenital abnormalities Renal transplantation Liver transplantation
Alcoholic hepatitis Antiretroviral therapy Arsenicals Autoimmune disease Chronic hepatitis Crohn’s disease Familial cases Fatty liver Schistosomiasis
Congestive heart failure Inherited thrombophilias Sickle cell disease"
3508,Who is at highest risk for Portal hypertension ?,"Patients who are at high risk for portal hypertension include:
Intravenous drug use (IVDU) Tattooing or piercing in unhygienic condition Needlestick injury Blood transfusion before 1992 Viral hepatitis Unprotected sexual intercourse Schistosomiasis in childhood Family history of hereditary liver disease"
3509,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Portal hypertension ?,"Patients with the following symptom have to seek urgent medical care:
Bloody vomiting Tarry stool Severe abdominal pain Yellowish discoloration of skin Dilated veins around the umbilicus"
3510,What to expect if I have Portal hypertension  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The symptoms of portal hypertension usually develop in the third to fourth decades of life. Dilated esophageal veins are typically developed 5-15% per year after hepatic fibrosis. Most of the cirrhotic patients will develop the varices, at least once during the lifetime. Approximately 60% of patients with cirrhosis develop ascites in 10 years. The presence of variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and renal insufficiency are associated with a particularly poor prognosis among patients with portal hypertension. They are the leading causes of death among patients with portal hypertension."
3511,What are the symptoms of Post traumatic stress disorder?,"Symptoms of PTSD fall into three main categories:
Reliving the event, which disturbs day-to-day activity
Flashback episodes, where the event seems to be happening again and again Repeated upsetting memories of the event Repeated nightmares of the event Strong, uncomfortable reactions to situations that remind you of the event
Avoidance
Emotional ""numbing"" or feeling as though you don't care about anything Feeling detached Being unable to remember important aspects of the trauma Having a lack of interest in normal activities Showing less of your moods Avoiding places, people, or thoughts that remind you of the event Feeling like you have no future
Arousal
Difficulty concentrating Startling easily Having an exaggerated response to things that startle you Feeling more aware (hypervigilance) Feeling irritable or having outbursts of anger Having trouble falling or staying asleep
You might feel guilt about the event (including survivor guilt). You might also have some of the following symptoms, which are typical of anxiety, stress, and tension:
Agitation or excitability Dizziness Fainting Feeling your heart beat in your chest Headache"
3512,What causes Post traumatic stress disorder?,"PTSD can occur at any age.
PTSD can follow a natural disaster such as a flood or fire, or events such as:
Assault Domestic abuse Prison stay Rape Terrorism War
For example, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 may have caused PTSD in some people who were involved, in people who saw the disaster, and in people who lost relatives and friends.
Veterans returning home from a war often have PTSD.
The cause of PTSD is unknown. Psychological, genetic, physical, and social factors are involved. PTSD changes the body's response to stress. It affects the stress hormones and chemicals that carry information between the nerves (neurotransmitters).
It is not known why traumatic events cause PTSD in some people but not others. Having a history of trauma may increase your risk for getting PTSD after a recent traumatic event."
3513,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Post traumatic stress disorder ?,"Although traumatic events can cause distress, not all feelings of distress are symptoms of PTSD. Talk about your feelings with friends and relatives. If your symptoms do not improve soon or are making you very upset, contact your doctor.
Seek help right away if:
You feel overwhelmed You are thinking of hurting yourself or anybody else You are unable to control your behavior You have other very upsetting symptoms of PTSD You can also contact your doctor for help with problems such as repeated upsetting thoughts, irritability, and problems with sleep."
3514,What to expect if I have Post traumatic stress disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"You can increase the chance of a good outcome with:
Early diagnosis Prompt treatment Strong social support"
3515,What are the symptoms of Postpartum depression?,"The symptoms of postpartum depression are the same as the symptoms of depression that occurs at other times in life.
Along with a sad or depressed mood, you may have some of the following symptoms:
Agitation or irritability Changes in appetite Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Feeling withdrawn or unconnected Lack of pleasure or interest in most or all activities Loss of concentration Loss of energy Problems doing tasks at home or work Negative feelings toward the baby Significant anxiety Thoughts of death or suicide Trouble sleeping
A mother with postpartum depression may also:
Be unable to care for herself or her baby Be afraid to be alone with her baby Have negative feelings toward the baby or even think about harming the baby (Although these feelings are scary, they are almost never acted on. Still you should tell your doctor about them right away.) Worry intensely about the baby, or have little interest in the baby"
3516,What causes Postpartum depression?,"Women commonly have mood changes during pregnancy, especially after delivery. These mood changes may be caused by changes in hormone levels.
Many non-hormonal factors may also affect mood during this period:
Changes in your body from pregnancy and delivery Changes in work and social relationships Having less time and freedom for yourself Lack of sleep Worries about your ability as a mother
Feelings of anxiety, irritation, tearfulness, and restlessness are common in the week or two after pregnancy. These feelings are often called the postpartum or baby blues. These symptoms almost always go away soon, without the need for treatment.
Postpartum depression may occur when the baby blues do not fade away or when signs of depression start 1 or more months after childbirth."
3517,Who is at highest risk for Postpartum depression ?,"You may have a higher chance of postpartum depression if you:
Are under age 20 Currently abuse alcohol, take illegal substances, or smoke (these also cause serious medical health risks for the baby) Did not plan the pregnancy, or had mixed feelings about the pregnancy Had depression, bipolar disorder (for example, manic depression), or an anxiety disorder before your pregnancy, or with a previous pregnancy Had a stressful event during the pregnancy or delivery, including personal illness, death or illness of a loved one, a difficult or emergency delivery, premature delivery, or illness or birth defect in the baby Have a close family member who has had depression or anxiety Have a poor relationship with your significant other or are single Have financial problems (low income, inadequate housing) Have little support from family, friends, or your significant other"
3518,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Postpartum depression ?,"Call your doctor if you experience any of the following:
Your baby blues don't go away after 2 weeks Symptoms of depression get more intense Symptoms of depression begin at any time after delivery, even many months later It is hard for you to perform tasks at work or at home You cannot care for yourself or your baby You have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby You develop thoughts that are not based in reality, or you start hearing or seeing things that other people cannot
Do not be afraid to seek help immediately if you feel overwhelmed and are afraid that you may hurt your baby."
3519,What to expect if I have Postpartum depression  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Medication and professional psychotherapy can often successfully reduce or eliminate symptoms.
3520,What are the symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome?,"Symptoms may include:
Almond-shaped eyes Delayed motor development Floppy newborn infant Insatiable appetite, food craving Irregular areas of skin that look like bands, stripes, or lines Narrow bifrontal skull Rapid weight gain Skeletal (limb) abnormalities Slow mental development Small for gestational age Undescended testicles in the male infant Very small hands and feet in comparison to body
Affected children have an intense craving for food and will do almost anything to get it. This results in uncontrollable weight gain and morbid obesity. Morbid obesity may lead to lung failure with low blood oxygen levels, right-sided heart failure, and death."
3521,What causes Prader-Willi syndrome?,"Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a gene missing on part of chromosome 15. Normally, your parents each pass down a copy of this chromosome. Most patients with Prader-Willi syndrome are missing the genetic material on part of the father's chromosome. The remaining patients frequently have two copies of the mother's chromosome 15."
3522,Who is at highest risk for Prader-Willi syndrome ?,The genetic changes occur randomly. Patients usually do not have a family history of the condition.
3523,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Prader-Willi syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if your child has symptoms of this condition. The disorder is frequently suspected at birth.
3524,What to expect if I have Prader-Willi syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Appropriate education will be needed for the affected person's IQ level. Weight control will allow for a much more comfortable and healthful life.
3525,What are the symptoms of Premature birth?,"A premature infant's organs are not fully developed. The infant needs special care in a nursery until the organ systems have developed enough to sustain life without medical support. This may take weeks to months.
A premature infant will have a lower birth weight than a full-term infant. Common physical signs of prematurity include:
Body hair (lanugo) Abnormal breathing patterns (shallow, irregular pauses in breathing called apnea) Enlarged clitoris (female infant) Problems breathing due to immature lungs (neonatal respiratory distress syndrome) or pneumonia Lower muscle tone and less activity than full-term infants Problems feeding due to difficulty sucking or coordinating swallowing and breathing Less body fat Small scrotum, smooth without ridges, and undescended testicles (male infant) Soft, flexible ear cartilage Thin, smooth, shiny skin, which is often transparent (can see veins under skin)
Not all premature babies will have these characteristics."
3526,What causes Premature birth?,"At birth, a baby is classified as one of the following:
Premature (less than 37 weeks gestation) Full term (37 to 42 weeks gestation) Post term (born after 42 weeks gestation)
If a woman goes into labor before 37 weeks, it is called preterm labor. Often, the cause of preterm labor is unknown. Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.) makes up about 15% of all premature births.
Health conditions and events in the mother may contribute to preterm labor. Examples are:
Diabetes Heart disease Infection (such as a urinary tract infection or infection of the amniotic membrane) Kidney disease"
3527,Who is at highest risk for Premature birth ?,"Different pregnancy-related problems increase the risk of preterm labor:
An ""insufficient"" or weakened cervix, also called cervical incompetence Birth defects of the uterus History of preterm delivery Poor nutrition right before or during pregnancy Preeclampsia: the development of high blood pressure and protein in the urine after the 20th week of pregnancy Premature rupture of the membranes (placenta previa)
Other factors that make preterm labor and a premature delivery more likely include:
African-American ethnicity (not related to socioeconomic status) Age (younger than 16 or older than 35) Lack of prenatal care Low socioeconomic status Use of tobacco, cocaine, or amphetamines"
3528,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Premature birth ?,"Call your health care provider if you are pregnant and believe you are going into labor prematurely.
If you are pregnant and not receiving prenatal care, call your health care provider or your state's department of health. Most state health departments have programs that provide prenatal care to mothers, whether or not they have insurance or are able to pay."
3529,What to expect if I have Premature birth  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prematurity used to be a major cause of infant deaths. Improved medical and nursing techniques have increased the survival of premature infants. The longer the pregnancy, the greater the chance of survival. Of babies born at 28 weeks, at least 90% survive.
&Prematurity can have long-term effects. Many premature infants have medical, developmental, or behavioral problems that continue into childhood or are permanent. The more premature an infant and the smaller the birth weight, the greater the risk of complications. However, it is impossible to predict a baby's long-term outcome based on gestational age or birth weight."
3530,What are the symptoms of Premature ovarian failure?,"Usual signs and symptoms of premature ovarin failure include the following:
Irregular or skipped periods (amenorrhea) Hot flashes and night sweats Irritability, poor concentration Vaginal dryness Decreased sexual desire Infertility Osteoporosis Low thyroid function, such as muscle hypotonia, fatigue and cold intolerance. Addison’s disease, such as fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite and weight loss. Heart diseases, such as palpitation and chest pain.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3531,What causes Premature ovarian failure?,"In many cases, the cause of premature ovarian failure is not clear. Some studies demonstrate that the following factors may be involved in the cause of this disorder.
Chromosomal defects: Studies demonstrate that certain genetic disorders may be associated with premature ovarian failure, such as Turner's syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Toxins: Toxins, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, cigarette smoke, chemicals, pesticides and viruses may damage the genetic material in cells and hasten ovarian failure. Autoimmune diseases: Autoimmune diseases may cause follicle dysfunction, which may produce antibodies against her own ovarian tissue and harm the egg-containing follicles, then result in premature ovarian failure. Age: The risk of ovarian failure rises as you age. Genentic factors: Having a family history of premature ovarian failure increases your risk of developing this disorder."
3532,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Premature ovarian failure ?,Call your health care provider if you have any symptoms of premature ovarian failure.
3533,What to expect if I have Premature ovarian failure  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis of most patients with premature ovarian failure may be good with the hormone replacement therapy.
3534,What are the symptoms of Premenstrual dysphoric disorder?,"The symptoms of PMDD are similar to those of PMS. However, they are generally more severe and debilitating and include a least one mood-related symptom. Symptoms occur during the week just before menstrual bleeding and usually improve within a few days after the period starts.
Five or more of the following symptoms must be present to diagnose PMDD, including one mood-related symptom:
Disinterest in daily activities and relationships Fatigue or low energy Feeling of sadness or hopelessness, possible suicidal thoughts Feelings of tension or anxiety Feeling out of control Food cravings or binge eating Mood swings marked by periods of teariness Panic attack Persistent irritability or anger that affects other people Physical symptoms, such as bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, and joint or muscle pain Problems sleeping Trouble concentrating"
3535,What causes Premenstrual dysphoric disorder?,"The causes of PMS and PMDD have not been found.
Hormone changes that occur during a woman's menstrual cycle appear to play a role.
PMDD affects between 3% and 8% of women during the years when they are having menstrual periods.
Many women with this condition have:
Anxiety Major depression Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
Other factors that may play a role include:
Alcohol abuse Being overweight Drinking large amounts of caffeine Having a mother with a history of the disorder Lack of exercise"
3536,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Premenstrual dysphoric disorder ?,"Call 911 or a local crisis line immediately if you are having suicidal thoughts.
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
Symptoms do not improve with self-treatment Symptoms interfere with your daily life"
3537,What to expect if I have Premenstrual dysphoric disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After proper diagnosis and treatment, most women with PMDD find that their symptoms go away or drop to tolerable levels."
3538,What are the symptoms of Premenstrual syndrome?,"PMS refers to a set of physical, behavioral, or emotional symptoms that tend to:
Start during the second half of the menstrual cycle (14 days or more after the first day of your last menstrual period) Go away 4 - 7 days after a menstrual period ends (during the first half of the menstrual cycle)
It is important to keep a daily diary or log to record the type of symptoms you have, how severe they are, and how long they last. You should keep this symptom diary for at least 3 months. It will help your doctor make an accurate PMS diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment.
The most common physical symptoms include:
Abdominal fullness, feeling gaseous Bloating of the abdomen Breast tenderness Clumsiness Constipation or diarrhea Food cravings Headache Less tolerance for noises and lights
Other symptoms include:
Confusion Difficulty concentrating Fatigue Feelings of sadness or hopelessness Feelings of tension, anxiety, or edginess Forgetfulness Irritable, hostile, or aggressive behavior, with outbursts of anger toward self or others Loss of sex drive (may be increased in some women) Mood swings Poor judgment Poor self-image, feelings of guilt, or increased fears Sleep problems (sleeping too much or too little) Slow, sluggish, lethargic movement"
3539,What causes Premenstrual syndrome?,"The exact cause of PMS has not been identified. Changes in brain hormone levels may play a role, but this has not been proven. Women with premenstrual syndrome may also respond differently to these hormones.
PMS may be related to social, cultural, biological, and psychological factors.
The condition is estimated to affect up to 75% of women during their childbearing years.
It occurs more often in women:
Between their late 20s and early 40s Who have at least one child With a personal or family history of major depression With a history of postpartum depression or an affective mood disorder
The symptoms typically get worse in a woman's late 30s and 40s as she approaches the transition to menopause.
As many as 50% - 60% of women with severe PMS have a premenstrual dysphoric disorder."
3540,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Premenstrual syndrome ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
PMS does not go away with self-treatment Your symptoms are so severe that they limit your ability to function"
3541,What to expect if I have Premenstrual syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most women who are treated for PMS symptoms get significant relief.
3542,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Prenatal care ?,"Call for an appointment if you suspect you are pregnant, are currently pregnant and are not receiving prenatal care, or if you are unable to manage common complaints without medication. Call your health care provider if you suspect you are pregnant and are on medications for diabetes, thyroid disease, seizures, or high blood pressure. Notify your health care provider if you are currently pregnant and have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection, chemicals, radiation, or unusual pollutants. Call your health care provider if you are currently pregnant and you develop fever, chills, or painful urination.
Call you doctor immediately:
It is urgent that you call your health care provider if you are currently pregnant and you have any amount of vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, physical or severe emotional trauma, or your water breaks (membranes rupture).
Also call if you are in the last half of your pregnancy and notice the baby is moving less or not at all."
3543,What are the symptoms of Presbycusis?,"Loss of hearing often occurs slowly over time.
Symptoms include:
Difficulty hearing people around you Frequently asking people to repeat themselves Frustration at not being able to hear Certain sounds seeming overly loud Problems hearing in noisy areas Problems telling apart certain sounds such as ""s"" or ""th"" More difficulty understanding people with higher-pitched voices Ringing in the ears
Talk to your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms. Symptoms of presbycusis may be like symptoms of other medical problems."
3544,What causes Presbycusis?,"Tiny hair cells inside your inner ear help you hear. They pick up sound waves and change them into the nerve signals that the brain interprets as sound. Hearing loss occurs when the tiny hair cells are damaged or die. The hair cells do not regrow, so most hearing loss caused by hair cell damage is permanent.
There is no known single cause of age-related hearing loss. Most commonly, it is caused by changes in the inner ear that occur as you grow older. Your genes and loud noise (such as from rock concerts or music headphones) may play a large role.
The following factors contribute to age-related hearing loss:
Family history (age-related hearing loss tends to run in families) Repeated exposure to loud noises Smoking (smokers are more likely to have such hearing loss than nonsmokers) Certain medical conditions such as diabetes Certain medicines"
3545,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Presbycusis ?,"Hearing loss should be checked as soon as possible. This helps rule out causes such as too much wax in the ear or side effects of medicines. Your health care provider should have you get a hearing test.
Contact your health care provider right away if you have a sudden change in your hearing or hearing loss with other symptoms such as headache, vision changes, or dizziness."
3546,What to expect if I have Presbycusis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Age-related hearing loss most often gets worse slowly. The hearing loss cannot be reversed and may lead to deafness.
Hearing loss may cause you to avoid leaving home. Seek help from your health care provider and family and friends to avoid becoming isolated. Hearing loss can be managed so that you can continue to live a full and active life."
3547,What are the symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis?,"At the beginning of the infection, the symptoms include severe frontal headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. Later on, more severe symptoms develop, including stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations and eventually coma."
3548,What causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis?,"Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is caused by Naegleria fowleri, a heat-loving (thermophilic), free-living ameba (single-celled microbe), commonly found around the world in warm fresh water (like lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil. Humans become infected when water containing Naegleria fowleri enters the nose, usually while swimming. People do not get infected by drinking contaminated water. The ameba migrates to the brain along the olfactory nerve, through a bony plate in the skull called the cribriform plate, where it reaches the brain and begins to destroy the brain tissue. The ameba has never been shown to have spread from one person to another."
3549,Who is at highest risk for Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis ?,"Naegleria fowleri is naturally found in warm freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers and poorly maintained or minimally chlorinated swimming pool. Swimming behaviors associated with the increased risk of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis include diving or jumping into the water, submerging the head under water, or engaging in other water-related activities that cause water to go up the nose. PAM also disproportionately affects males and children. The reason for this distribution pattern is unclear but may reflect the types of water activities (such as diving or watersports) that might be more common among young boys."
3550,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis ?,"PAM is a fatal disease. Any patient with suspicious symptoms of meningoencephalitis should immediately seek medical care, especially in areas were recent cases of Naegleria fowleri are reported."
3551,What to expect if I have Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Symptoms start 1-7 days (median 5 days) after swimming exposure and people die 1-12 days (median 5.3 days) after symptoms begin.
3552,What are the symptoms of Primary biliary cirrhosis?,"More than half of patients have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Symptoms usually come on gradually and may include:
Abdominal pain Enlarged liver Fatigue Fatty deposits under the skin Fatty stools Itching Jaundice Soft yellow spots on the eyelid"
3553,What causes Primary biliary cirrhosis?,"The cause of inflamed bile ducts in the liver is not known. However, primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disorder. That means your body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
The disease more commonly affects middle-aged women.
Long-term bile obstruction is believed to lead to liver cirrhosis. The disease may be associated with autoimmune disorders such as:
Celiac disease Raynaud's phenomenon Sicca syndrome (dry eyes or mouth) Thyroid disease"

Abdominal swelling Blood in the stools Confusion Jaundice Itching of the skin that does not go away and is not related to other causes Vomiting blood"
3555,What to expect if I have Primary biliary cirrhosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome can vary. If the condition is not treated, most patients will need a liver transplant to prevent death from this condition. About a quarter of patients who've had the disease for 10 years will experience liver failure. Doctors can now use a statistical model to predict the best time to do the transplant."
3556,What are the symptoms of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"Early Non-Hodgkin lymphoma does not have any symptoms. People may notice one or more of the following symptoms as the tumor developing or when detected by regular examinations:
Fever Night sweat Unexplained weight loss Severe itchiness Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
Coughing or shortness of breath may occur if the cancer affects the thymus gland or lymph nodes in the chest, which may put pressure on the windpipe (trachea) or other airways.
Some patients may have abdominal pain or swelling, which may lead to a loss of appetite, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
If the cancer affects cells in the brain, the person may have a headache, concentration problems, personality changes, or seizures."
3557,What causes Non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"White blood cells called lymphocytes are found in lymph tissues. They help prevent infections. Most lymphomas start in a type of white blood cells called B lymphocytes, or B cells.
For most patients, the cause of this cancer is unknown. However, lymphomas may develop in people with weakened immune systems. For example, the risk of lymphoma increases after an organ transplant or in people with HIV infection.
There are many different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is grouped according to how fast cancer spreads.
cancer may be low grade (slow-growing), intermediate grade, or high grade (fast-growing). Burkitt's lymphoma is an example of a high-grade lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a low-grade lymphoma. The cancer is further grouped by how the cells look under the microscope, for example, if there are certain proteins or genetic markers present.
According to the American Cancer Society, a person has a 1 in 50 chance of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. NHL most often affects adults. However, children can get some forms of lymphoma. You are more likely to get lymphoma if you have a weakened immune system or have had an organ transplant.
This type of cancer is slightly more common in men than in women."
3558,Who is at highest risk for Primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is related to several factors.
Immune system deficiency: People with weakened immune systems, such as people who receive organ transplants or infected with HIV, have an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Autoimmune diseases: Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and others have been linked with an increased rate of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Certain infections such as T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Exposure of chemicals such as benzene, certain herbicides, and insecticides, exposure to radiation Bad life-style: Overweight, obese, diet poor in vegetables. Age: Most cases of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma occur in people older than 60. Gender: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs slightly more often in men than in women. Geography: Worldwide, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having the highest rates."

Pathological gambling often involves repetitive behaviors. People with this problem have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble.
Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder, pathological gambling is likely a different condition.
In people who develop pathological gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems."
3563,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Problem gambling ?,Call your health care provider or mental health professional if you believe you have symptoms of pathological gambling.
3564,What to expect if I have Problem gambling  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Like alcohol or drug addiction, pathological gambling is a chronic disorder that tends to get worse without treatment.

3566,What causes Progressive supranuclear palsy?,"Progressive supranuclear palsy is a condition that causes symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease.
It involves damage to many cells of the brain. Many areas are affected, including the part of the brainstem where cells that control eye movement are located. Also affected is an area of the brain that controls steadiness when you walk. The frontal lobes of the brain are also affected, leading to personality changes.
The cause of the damage to the brain cells is unknown. The disease gets worse over time.
People with this condition have deposits in brain tissues that look like those found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. There is a loss of tissue in most areas of the brain and in some parts of the spinal cord.
The disorder is most often seen in people over 60 years old, and is somewhat more common in men."

Other health problems such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
If cancer has spread, a man may experience:
Bone pain in the back, hips, thighs, shoulders, or in other bones Unexplained weight loss Fatigue Other symptoms, depending on the location"
3570,What causes Prostate cancer?,Prostate cancer is the third most common cause of death from cancer in men of all ages and is the most common cause of death from cancer in men over age 75. Prostate cancer is rarely found in men younger than 40.

Bladder outlet obstruction Foreskin of the penis that cannot be pulled back (phimosis) Injury to the area between the scrotum and anus (perineum) Urinary catheter, cystoscopy, or prostate biopsy (removing a piece of tissue to look for cancer)
Men age 50 or older who have an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) are at increased risk for prostatitis. The prostate gland may become blocked, making it easier for bacteria to grow. Symptoms of chronic prostatitis can be very similar to symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland."
3577,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Prostatitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of prostatitis.
3578,What to expect if I have Prostatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acute prostatitis should clear up completely with medicine and minor changes to your diet and behavior.

3581,How to know you have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome?,"Salivary cortisol level: Measurement of ate-night salivary cortisol concentrations can be used as a screening test in suspected pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. The 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC): In this test, a patient’s urine is collected several times over a 24-hour period and tested for cortisol. Patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome may show moderately increased in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) level. Blood level of cortisol: Patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome may show elevated levels of serum cortisol in the morning and evening and the morning level is not suppressed to less than 5 µg/dL by 1 mg dexamethasone administered at midnight. A midnight cortisol level of less than 7.5 µg/dL is an important difference between pseudo-Cushing and true Cushing's syndrome. Liver function: Elevation of serum transaminase levels suggest alcohol-induced hepatitis. Blood alcohol level: Because many patients of pseudo-Cushing's syndrome are caused by alcohol abuse, blood alcohol level may be helpful."

Signs and symptoms in type 1b and type 2
Numbness Tetany Seizures Cataracts Dental problems
Signs and symptoms in type 1a: Type 1a is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is also called Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Besides signs in type 1b and type 2, patients with type 1a may have the following symptoms:
Short stature: Round face, short neck, and short hand bones Calcium deposits under the skin Dimples that can replace knuckles on affected fingers
Diseases with similar symptoms
Hypoparathyroidism Rickets"
3585,What causes Pseudohypoparathyroidism?,"The parathyroid glands help control calcium use and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.
Persons with pseudohypoparathyroidism produce the right amount of PTH, but the body is ""resistant"" to its effect. This causes low blood calcium levels and high blood phosphate levels.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism is caused by abnormal genes. All forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism are very rare.
Type Ia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. That means only one parent needs to pass you the defective gene in order for you to develop the condition. The condition causes short stature, round face, and short hand bones, and is also called Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.
Type Ib involves resistance to PTH only in the kidneys. Type Ib is less understood than type Ia. Type II is very similar to type I in its clinical features, but the events that take place in the kidneys are different.
Type II pseudohypoparathyroidism also involves low blood calcium and high blood phosphate levels, but persons with this form do not develop the physical characteristics seen in those with Type Ia.
All forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism are very rare."
3586,Who is at highest risk for Pseudohypoparathyroidism ?,All forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism are very rare. It is caused by abnormal genes. Researches demonstrate that type 1a is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Some wild animals and ticks also carry the bacteria. You can get Q fever by drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk, or after inhaling dust or droplets in the air that are contaminated with animal feces, blood, or birth products. Symptoms usually develop 2 to 3 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria. This is called the incubation period. Most people may have no symptoms; others may have moderately severe symptoms similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may last for several weeks. People at risk for infection include slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, researchers, food processors, and sheep and cattle workers. Men are infected more often than women, and most people who get Q fever are between 30 and 70 years old. This disease is occasionally seen in children, especially those who live on a farm.

3635,"What to expect if I have Radiation enteropathy natural history, complications, and prognosis (Outlook/Prognosis)?","When the abdomen receives radiation, there is always some nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
In most cases, the symptoms get better 2 - 3 weeks after treatment ends.
However, when this condition develops, symptoms may last for a long period of time. Long-term (chronic) enteritis is rarely curable."
3636,Who is at highest risk for Radiation enteropathy risk factors?,"Anyone who receives radiation therapy to the belly or pelvic area is at risk. This may include people with cervical, pancreatic, prostate, uterine, or colon and rectal cancer."
3637,What are the symptoms of Rat-bite fever?,"Symptoms depend on the bacteria that caused the infection. Symptoms due to Streptobacillus moniliformis may include:
Fever Chills Joint pain, redness, or swelling Rash
Symptoms due to Spirillum minus may include:
Fever Chills Open sore at the site of the bite Rash -- may be red/purple plaques"
3638,What causes Rat-bite fever?,"Rat-bite fever can be caused by the two different bacteria, Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minus, both of which are found in the mouths of rodents."
3639,Who is at highest risk for Rat-bite fever ?,"The disease has been seen in:
Africa Australia Europe Japan North and South America
Most people get rat-bite fever through contact with urine or secretions from the mouth, eye, or nose of an infected animal. This most commonly occurs though a bite, yet some cases may occur simply through contact with these secretions. The source of the infection is usually a rat. Other animals that may cause infection include squirrels, weasels, and gerbils."
3640,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rat-bite fever ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You or your child has had recent contact with a rat or other rodent The person who was bitten has symptoms of rat-bite fever"
3641,What to expect if I have Rat-bite fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook is excellent with early treatment. Untreated, the death rate can be as high as 25%."
3642,What are the symptoms of Reactive attachment disorder?,"Child:
Avoids caregiver Avoids physical contact Is difficult to comfort Does not make distinctions when socializing with strangers Resists social interaction Wants to be alone
Caregiver:
Disregard for child's basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection Disregard for child's basic physical needs like food, toileting, and play"
3643,What causes Reactive attachment disorder?,"Reactive attachment disorder is caused by abuse or neglect of an infant's needs for:
Emotional bonds with a primary or secondary caretaker Food Physical safety Touching
The risk of neglect to the infant or child increases when the:
Caregiver is mentally retarded Caregiver lacks parenting skills Parents are isolated Parents are teenagers
A frequent change in caregivers (for example, in orphanages or foster care) is another cause of reactive attachment disorder.
Children who are adopted from foreign orphanages are commonly affected, particularly if they were removed from their birth parents during the first weeks of life."
3644,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Reactive attachment disorder ?,"This disorder is usually identified when a parent (or prospective parent) is at high risk for neglect or when an adoptive parent has difficulty coping with a newly adopted child.
If you have recently adopted a child from a foreign orphanage or another situation where neglect may have occurred and your child shows these symptoms, see your health care provider."
3645,What to expect if I have Reactive attachment disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The right intervention can improve the outcome.
3646,What are the symptoms of Relapsing fever?,Bleeding Coma Facial droop Headache Joint aches (arthralgia) Muscle aches (myalgia) Nausea Neck stiffness Rigors Seizures Sudden onset of high fever Unsteady gait Vomiting Weakness
3647,What causes Relapsing fever?,"Relapsing fever is an infection caused by several species of bacteria in the Borrelia family.
There are two major forms of relapsing fever:
Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is transmitted by the Ornithodoros tick and occurs in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia, and certain areas in the western United States and Canada. The bacteria species associated with TBRF are Borrelia duttoni, Borrelia hermsii, and Borrelia parkerii. Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is transmitted by body lice and is most common in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. The bacteria species associated with LBRF is Borrelia recurrentis.
Sudden fever occurs within 2 weeks of infection. In LBRF, the fever usually lasts 3-6 days and is usually followed by a single, milder episode. In TRBF, multiple episodes of fever occur and each may last up to 3 days. Individuals may be free of fever for up to 2 weeks before it returns.
In both forms, the fever episode may end in ""crisis."" This consists of shaking chills, followed by intense sweating, falling body temperature, and low blood pressure. This stage may result in death in up to 10% of people.
After several cycles of fever, some people may develop dramatic central nervous system signs such as seizures, stupor, and coma. The Borrelia organism may also invade heart and liver tissues, causing inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and liver (hepatitis). Widespread bleeding and pneumonia are other complications."
3648,Who is at highest risk for Relapsing fever ?,"In the United States, TBRF usually occurs west of the Mississippi River, particularly in the mountainous West and the high deserts and plains of the Southwest. In the mountains of California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, infections are usually caused by Borrelia hermsii and are often acquired in cabins in forests. It is possible that the risk now extends into the southeastern United States.
LBRF is mainly a disease of the developing world. It is currently seen in Ethiopia and Sudan. Famine, war, and the movement and groups of refugees often result in epidemics of LBRF. The largest recent epidemics of LBRF occurred during World Wars I and II. At least 1 million people died during these epidemics."
3649,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Relapsing fever ?,Notify your medical provider if you are a returning traveler and you develop fever; there are many different possible infections that will need to be investigated in a timely manner.
3650,What to expect if I have Relapsing fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The death rate for untreated LBRF ranges from 10 - 70%. In TBRF, it is 4 -10%. With early treatment, the death rate is reduced. Those who have developed coma, myocarditis, liver problems, or pneumonia are more likely to die."
3651,What are the symptoms of Renal cell carcinoma?,"Early renal cell carcinoma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Hematuria (blood in the urine) Lower back pain on one side A mass or lump on one side of the lower back Fatigue and unexplained weight loss Peripheral edema (swelling of ankles and legs)
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell his/her doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.Diseases with similar symptoms are listed in the following:
Urinary calculi Urinary tract infection Bladder cancer and ureter cancer Urinary tract tuberculosis"
3652,Who is at highest risk for Renal cell carcinoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of renal cell carcinoma is related to several factors.
Genetic and hereditary risk factors
Von Hippel-Lindau disease
Hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma
Hereditary leiomyomatosis
Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome
Hereditary renal oncocytoma
Lifestyle-related and job-related risk factors
Smoking: Tobacco use increases the risk of developing renal cell carcinoma.
Obesity: Clinical surveys demonstrate that renal cell carcinoma has a close relationship with people who are very overweight.
Workplace exposures: Clinical studies have suggested that workplace exposure to certain substances such as asbestos, cadmium, some herbicides, benzene, and organic solvents, particularly trichloroethylene, may increase the risk for renal cell carcinoma.
Drugs: Some studies have suggested that phenacetin (non-prescription pain reliever) and diuretics (medicines uesd to treat hypertension or heart failure by causing the kidneys to remove salt and fluid from the body) may be linked to renal cell carcinoma.
Advanced kidney disease: People with advanced kidney disease, especially those needing dialysis, have a higher risk of renal cell carcinoma. The reasons may be the accumulation of the metabolic toxin.
A family history of renal cell carcinoma
Hypertension
Gender: Men have about twice the risk of developing renal cell carcinoma than women.
Race: Epidemical data shows that African Americans have a slightly higher rate of renal cell carcinoma than other races."
3653,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Renal cell carcinoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of renal cell carcinoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe low back pain or abdominal pain A large amount of hematuria"
3654,What to expect if I have Renal cell carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on:
The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the kidneys. The individual's response to treatment"
3655,What are the symptoms of retinal detachment?,"Bright flashes of light, especially in peripheral vision Blurred vision A sudden or gradual increase in the number of floaters in the eye Shadow or blindness in a part of the visual field of one eye Appearance of a curtain over the field of vision"
3656,What are the causes of retinal detachment?,"Retinal detachments are often associated with a tear or hole in the retina through which eye fluids may leak. This causes separation of the retina from the underlying tissues.
Retinal detachment often occurs on its own without an underlying cause. However, it may also be caused by trauma, diabetes, or an inflammatory disorder. It is most often caused by a related condition called posterior vitreous detachment.
The risk factors are previous eye surgery, nearsightedness, a family history of retinal detachment, uncontrolled diabetes, and trauma."
3657,Who is at highest risk for Retinal detachment ?,"A retinal detachment can occur at any age, but it is more common in people over age 40. It affects men more than women, and Whites more than African Americans.
A retinal detachment is also more likely to occur in people who:
Are extremely nearsighted Have had a retinal detachment in the other eye Have a family history of retinal detachment Have had cataract surgery Have other eye diseases or disorders, such as retinoschisis, uveitis, degenerative myopia, or lattice degeneration Have had an eye injury"
3658,What to expect if I have Retinal detachment  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"What happens will depend on the location and extent of the detachment and whether you receive early treatment. With modern therapy, over 90 percent of those with a retinal detachment can be successfully treated, although sometimes a second treatment is needed. However, the final visual outcome is not always predictable and may not be known for up to several months following surgery. Even under the best of circumstances, and even after multiple attempts at repair, treatment sometimes fails and vision may eventually be lost.
Visual results are best if the retinal detachment is repaired before the macula (the center region of the retina responsible for fine, detailed vision) detaches. That is why it is important to contact an eye care professional immediately if you see a sudden or gradual increase in the number of floaters and/or light flashes, or a dark curtain over the field of vision."
3659,What are the symptoms of Retropharyngeal abscess?,Breathing difficulty Difficulty swallowing Drooling High fever High-pitched sound when inhaling (stridor) Muscles between the ribs pull in when breathing (intercostal retractions) Severe throat pain
3660,What causes Retropharyngeal abscess?,Infected material (pus) builds up in the space around the tissues at the back of the throat. This can occur during or immediately after a throat infection.
3661,Who is at highest risk for Retropharyngeal abscess ?,"Retropharyngeal abscess generally affects children under age 5, but it can occur at any age."
3662,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Retropharyngeal abscess ?,"Call your health care provider if you or your child develops a high fever with severe throat pain.
Seek immediate medical help if you have:
Breathing difficulty High-pitched breathing sounds (stridor) Muscles between the ribs pull in when breathing (intercostal retractions)"
3663,What to expect if I have Retropharyngeal abscess  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"It is important to get immediate medical help. This condition can lead to blockage of the airway, which can be life-threatening. With prompt treatment, you can make a full recovery."
3664,What are the symptoms of Retroverted uterus?,"Retroversion of the uterus almost never causes any symptoms. Rarely, it may cause pain or discomfort."
3665,What causes Retroverted uterus?,"Retroversion of the uterus is common. It is the normal uterine position in about 20% of all women.
Weakening pelvic ligaments associated with menopause may cause this condition in women who previously did not have a retroverted uterus.
Enlargement of the uterus, either as the result of a pregnancy or a tumor, may also lead to retroversion.
Scar tissue in the pelvis (pelvic adhesions) can also hold the uterus in a retroverted position. Such scarring may result from:
Endometriosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Salpingitis Pelvic surgery"
3666,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Retroverted uterus ?,Call your health care provider if you develop persistent pelvic pain or discomfort.
3667,What to expect if I have Retroverted uterus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Usually this condition does not cause problems.
3668,What are the symptoms of Rett syndrome?,"An infant with Rett syndrome usually has normal development for the first 6 - 18 months. Symptoms range from mild to severe.
Symptoms may include:
Apraxia Breathing problems: problems tend to get worse with stress; breathing is usually normal during sleep and abnormal while awake Change in development Excessive saliva and drooling Floppy arms and legs: frequently the first sign Intellectual disabilities and learning difficulties (assessing cognitive skills in those with Rett syndrome, however, is difficult because of the speech and hand motion abnormalities) Scoliosis Shaky, unsteady, or stiff gait; or toe walking Seizures Slowing head growth beginning at approximately 5 - 6 months of age Loss of normal sleep patterns Loss of purposeful hand movements; for example, the grasp used to pick up small objects is replaced by repetitive hand motions like hand wringing or constant placement of hands in mouth Loss of social engagement Ongoing, severe constipation and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Poor circulation that can lead to cold and bluish arms and legs Severe language development problems
Problems in breathing pattern may be the most upsetting and difficult symptom for parents to watch. Why they happen and what to do about them is not well understood. Most experts in Rett syndrome recommend that parents remain calm through an episode of irregular breathing like breath holding. It may help to remind yourself that normal breathing always returns and that your child will become used to the abnormal breathing pattern."
3669,What causes Rett syndrome?,"Rett syndrome occurs almost exclusively in girls and may be misdiagnosed as autism or cerebral palsy.
Studies have linked many Rett syndrome cases to a defect in the methl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene. This gene is on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so even when one has this significant defect, the other X chromosome is normal enough for the child to survive.
Males born with this defective gene do not have a second X chromosome to make up for the problem. Therefore, the defect usually results in miscarriage, stillbirth, or very early death.
The condition affects about 1 out of 10,000 children. Groups of the disease have appeared within families and certain geographic regions, including Norway, Sweden, and northern Italy."
3670,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rett syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if you have any concerns about your child's development, if you notice a lack of normal development with motor or language skills in a child, or if there are associated disorders that need treatment."
3671,What to expect if I have Rett syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The disease slowly progresses until the patient is a teenager. Then, symptoms may improve. For example, seizures or breathing problems tend to lessen in late adolescence.
Developmental regression or delays vary. Usually, a child with Rett syndrome sits up properly but may not crawl. For those who do crawl, many do so by scooting on their tummy without using their hands.
Similarly, some children walk independently within the normal age range, while others are delayed, don't learn to walk independently at all, or don't learn to walk until late childhood or early adolescence. For those children who do learn to walk at the normal time, some keep that ability for their lifetime, while other children lose the skill.
Life expectancies are not well studied, although survival at least until the mid-20s is likely. The average life expectancy of a girl with Rett syndrome may be mid-40s. Death is often related to seizure, aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and accidents."
3672,What are the symptoms of Rh incompatibility?,"Rh incompatibility can cause symptoms ranging from very mild to deadly.
In its mildest form, Rh incompatibility causes the destruction of red blood cells.
After birth, the infant may have:
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and lethargy"
3673,What causes Rh incompatibility?,"During pregnancy, red blood cells from the unborn baby can cross into the mother's bloodstream through the placenta.
If the mother is Rh-negative, her immune system treats Rh-positive fetal cells as if they were a foreign substance and makes antibodies against the fetal blood cells. These anti-Rh antibodies may cross back through the placenta into the developing baby and destroy the baby's circulating red blood cells.
When red blood cells are broken down, they make bilirubin. This causes an infant to become yellow (jaundiced). The level of bilirubin in the infant's bloodstream may range from mild to dangerously high.
Because it takes time for the mother to develop antibodies, first born infants are often not affected unless the mother had past miscarriages or abortions that sensitized her immune system. However, all children she has afterwards who are also Rh-positive may be affected.
Rh incompatibility develops only when the mother is Rh-negative and the infant is Rh-positive. Thanks to the use of special immune globulins called RhoGHAM, this problem has become uncommon in the United States and other places that provide access to good prenatal care."
3674,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rh incompatibility ?,Call your health care provider if you think or know you are pregnant and have not yet seen a doctor.
3675,What to expect if I have Rh incompatibility  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Full recovery is expected for mild Rh incompatibility.
3676,What are the symptoms of Rhinitis?,"The symptoms of rhinitis can include the following:
Runny nose
Stuffy nose Sneezing Nose itching
Eye symptoms such as itching, tearing, redness, also frequently occur in patients with rhinitis, especially when the cause is as a result of allergies. Dark circles may later appear under the eyes Headache, tiredness, cough can also occur"
3677,What causes Rhinitis?,"Allergic rhinitis - This is caused by allergens. An allergen is something that triggers an allergy. Examples of allergens are pollens, mold, animal dander, or dust. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen, the body responds by releasing chemicals that cause the allergy symptoms.
Nonallergic rhinitis - There are different types of nonallergic rhinitis. The exact cause of some of the types is not known. The symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis can be triggered by the following:
Dry air Cold air Alcohol intake Spicy food Strong emotions Infection- such as common cold. This is the second most common type of rhinitis in children. The most common type of rhinitis is the allergic type."
3678,Who is at highest risk for Rhinitis ?,Children whose parents have allergic rhinitis or other conditions that are caused by allergies have an increased risk. Individuals who already have some conditions that are cause by allergies such as asthma are at a greater risk. Exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollutants can also increase the risk of having rhinitis. Children who attend daycare also have a higher risk of getting the rhinitis caused by infections.
3679,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rhinitis ?,"You should seek urgent help if your symptoms affect your daily activities such as your work/school performance, sleep, leisure, sport, etc. You should also seek help if your symptoms do not respond to treatment or if the treatment no longer works."
3680,What to expect if I have Rhinitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most symptoms of rhinitis can be treated. For some people, the symptoms resolve as they grow older."
3681,What are the symptoms of Sinusitis?,"The classic symptoms of acute sinusitis in adults usually follow a cold that does not improve, or one that worsens after 5 - 7 days of symptoms. Symptoms include:
Bad breath or loss of smell Cough, often worse at night Fatigue and generally not feeling well Fever Headache -- pressure-like pain, pain behind the eyes, toothache, or facial tenderness Nasal congestion and discharge Sore throat and postnasal drip
Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are the same as those of acute sinusitis, but tend to be milder and last longer than 8 weeks.
Symptoms of Rhinosinusitis in children include:
Cold or respiratory illness that has been improving and then begins to get worse High fever, along with a darkened nasal discharge, for at least 3 days Nasal discharge, with or without a cough, that has been present for more than 10 days and is not improving"
3682,What causes Rhinosinusitis?,"The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the skull (behind the forehead, nasal bones, cheeks, and eyes) that are lined with mucus membranes. Healthy sinuses contain no bacteria or other germs. Usually, mucus is able to drain out and air is able to circulate.
When the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up, bacteria and other germs can grow more easily.
Rhinosinusitis can occur from one of these conditions:
Small hairs (cilia) in the sinuses, which help move mucus out, do not work properly due to some medical conditions. Colds and allergies may cause too much mucus to be made or block the opening of the sinuses. A deviated nasal septum, nasal bone spur, or nasal polyps may block the opening of the sinuses.
Rhinosinusitis can be:
Acute -- symptoms last 2 - 8 weeks Chronic -- symptoms last much longer
Acute sinusitis is caused by damage to the lining of the sinuses from surgery or infections. Chronic sinusitis may be caused by bacteria or a fungus."
3683,Who is at highest risk for Rhinosinusitis ?,"The following may increase your risk or your child's risk of developing Rhinoinusitis:
Allergic rhinitis or hay fever Cystic fibrosis Day care Diseases that prevent the cilia from working properly, such as Kartagener syndrome and immotile cilia syndrome. Changes in altitude (flying or scuba diving) Large adenoids Tooth infections (rare) Weakened immune system from HIV or chemotherapy"
3684,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rhinosinusitis ?,"Call your doctor if:
Your symptoms last longer than 10 - 14 days or you have a cold that gets worse after 7 days You have a severe headache, unrelieved by over-the-counter pain medicine You have a fever You still have symptoms after taking all of your antibiotics properly
A green or yellow discharge does not necessarily indicate a sinus infection or the need for antibiotics."
3685,What to expect if I have Rhinosinusitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Sinus infections are usually curable with self-care measures and medical treatment. If you are having recurrent attacks, you should be checked for underlying causes such as nasal polyps or other problems, such as allergies."
3686,What are the symptoms of rotavirus infection?,Vomiting Watery diarrhea Fever Abdominal pain Symptoms of dehydration include: Decrease in urination Dry mouth and throat Feeling dizzy when standing up Cry with few or no tears Unusually sleepy or fussy Adults who get rotavirus disease tend to have milder symptoms.
3687,Who is at highest risk for Rotavirus infection ?,"Those in child care centers or other settings with many young children are most at risk for infection. Unvaccinated children, aged 3 to 35 months old, can be severely infected by rotavirus. Older adults have, to some extent, a risk of getting infected. Adults who are caring for infected children by rota virus. Immunocompromised patients like HIV patients."
3688,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rotavirus infection ?,In cases of severe dehydration the patient must be hospitalized.
3689,What are the symptoms of sacrococcygeal teratoma?,"*Neonatal and infants tumors: It presents protruding from the sacral site, a visible lump under the skin at the top of the buttocks crease. If not visible, it can sometimes be felt like gently prodded.
*Children tumor: The tumor presents as a palpable mass in the sacropelvic region compressing the bladder or rectum. These may make the child discomfort or pain.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a paediatrician can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the paediatrician so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3690,Who is at risk for sacrococcygeal teratoma?,The cause of sacrococcygeal teratoma is not clear.
3691,How to know you have sacrococcygeal teratoma?,"Pregnant peroid
Blood level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in women: This is a routine part of prenatal care in pregnancy peroid. For patients suspected sacrococcygeal teratoma, the level is high.
Ultrasound: This test uses ultrasound to presentate the image of the tumor. It can show a mass which may be either cystic or solid in appearance or commonly a mixture of both.
Childhood
Ultrasonography: This is an painless test which uses sound waves to create a picture of the internal organs. Because tumors generate different echoes of sound waves than normal tissue, the doctor can locate a mass inside the body.
X-ray: This test uses X-ray to demonstrate the image of the tumor. Sometimes the doctor may see the shadow of teeth and bones.
Computed tomography (CT) scan and biopsy: CT scans are often used to diagnose sacrococcygeal teratoma. It can confirm the location of the tumor and show the organs nearby. These are helpful for determining the stage of the cancer and in determining whether surgery is a good treatment option. CT scans can also be used to guide biopsy and a biopsy sample is usually removed and looked at under a microscope.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI uses magnetic fields but it is a different type of image than what is produced by computed tomography (CT) and produces detailed images of the body. Like computed tomography (CT), a contrast agent may be injected into a patient’s vein to create a better picture."
3692,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sacrococcygeal teratoma ?,"During the pregnant peroid, be careful to observe any changes of yourself and the fetus. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Mirror syndrome Polyhydramnios Preterm labor"
3693,What to expect if I have Sacrococcygeal teratoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma depends on the following:
The location of the tumor
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery
The stage of the tumor
The patient’s general health
Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
3694,What are the symptoms of Salmonellosis?,"The onset of disease symptoms occurs 6 - 72 hours (usually 12-36 hours) after ingestion of salmonella. It is usually characterized by acute onset of:
Fever Headache Abdominal pain Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite
The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Symptoms of salmonellosis are relatively mild and patients make a recovery without specific treatment in most cases. However, in some cases, particularly in the very young and in the elderly patients, the associated dehydration can become severe and life-threatening. The diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites. Unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics, death may occur."
3695,What causes Salmonellosis?,"Salmonellosis is caused by salmonella. For salmonella species, over 2 500 different strains (called ""serotypes"" or ""serovars"") have been identified to date. Salmonella is a ubiquitous and hardy bacteria that can survive several weeks in a dry environment and several months in water. The bacteria live in the intestinal tract of humans and other animals, including birds.
Salmonella are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Contaminated foods are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk, or eggs, but any food, including vegetables, may become contaminated.
Food may become contaminated by the hands of an infected food handler who did not wash hands with soap after using the bathroom.
Salmonella may also be found in the feces of some pets, especially those with diarrhea, and people can become infected if they do not wash their hands after contact with pets or pet feces. Reptiles, such as turtles, lizards, and snakes, are particularly likely to harbor Salmonella. Many chickens and young birds carry Salmonella in their feces."
3696,Who is at highest risk for Salmonellosis ?,"Children are at highest risk to get salmonellosis. The rate of diagnosed infections in children less than five years old is about five times higher than the rate in all other persons.
Persons at risk of severe disease or complications, include:
Children Elderly Immunocompromised persons
Salmonellosis is more common in the summer than winter."
3697,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Salmonellosis ?,"The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness."
3698,What to expect if I have Salmonellosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.
Persons with diarrhea usually recover completely, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. A small number of persons with Salmonella develop pain in their joints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urination. This is called Reiter's syndrome. It can last for months or years, and can lead to chronic arthritis which is difficult to treat. Antibiotic treatment does not make a difference in whether or not the person develops arthritis. Other possible complication is typhoid fever, a more serious disease caused by a certain strain of Salmonella, however, it is not common in the United States, frequently occurring in developing countries."
3699,What are the symptoms of Schistosomiasis?,"Symptoms vary with the species of worm and the phase of infection.
Heavy infestation (many parasites) may cause fever, chills, lymph node enlargement, and liver and spleen enlargement. Initial invasion of the skin may cause itching and a rash (swimmer's itch). In this condition, the schistosome is destroyed within the skin. Intestinal symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea (which may be bloody). Urinary symptoms may include frequent urination, painful urination (dysuria), and blood in the urine (hematuria)."
3700,What causes Schistosomiasis?,"You get a Schistosoma infection through contact with contaminated water. The parasite in its infective stages is called a cercaria. It swims freely in open bodies of water.
On contact with humans, the parasite burrows into the skin, matures into another stage (schistosomula), then migrates to the lungs and liver, where it matures into the adult form.
The adult worm then migrates to its preferred body part, depending on its species. These areas include the bladder, rectum, intestines, liver, portal venous system (the veins that carry blood from the intestines to liver), spleen, and lungs.
Schistosomiasis is not usually seen in the United States. It is common in many tropical and subtropical areas worldwide."
3701,Who is at highest risk for Schistosomiasis ?,Living in endemic areas and being in contact with contaminated water are risk factors.
3702,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Schistosomiasis ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of schistosomiasis, especially if you have traveled to a tropical or sub-tropical area where the disease is known to exist or if you have been exposed to contaminated or suspect bodies of water."
3703,What to expect if I have Schistosomiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Treatment before significant damage or severe complications occurs usually produces good results.
3704,What are the symptoms of Schizoaffective disorder?,"The symptoms of schizoaffective disorder are different in each person. Often, people with schizoaffective disorder seek treatment for p roblems with mood, daily function, or abnormal thoughts.
Psychosis and mood problems may occur at the same time, or by themselves. The course of the disorder may involve cycles of severe symptoms followed by improvement.
The symptoms of schizoaffective disorder can include:
Changes in appetite and energy Disorganized speech that is not logical False beliefs (delusions), such as thinking someone is trying to harm you (paranoia) or thinking that special messages are hidden in common places (delusions of reference) Lack of concern with hygiene or grooming Mood that is either too good, or depressed or irritable Problems sleeping Problems with concentration Sadness or hopelessness Seeing or hearing things that aren't there (hallucinations) Social isolation Speaking so quickly that others cannot interrupt you"
3705,What causes Schizoaffective disorder?,"The exact cause of schizoaffective disorder is unknown. Changes in genes and chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) may play a role. Some experts do not believe it is a separate disorder from schizophrenia.
Schizoaffective disorder is believed to be less common than schizophrenia and mood disorders. Women may have the condition more often than men. Schizoaffective disorder tends to be rare in children."
3706,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Schizoaffective disorder ?,"Call your health care or mental health provider if you or someone you know is experiencing any of the following:
Depression with feelings of hopelessness or helplessness Inability to care for basic personal needs Increase in energy and involvement in risky behavior that is sudden and not normal for you (for instance, going days without sleeping and feeling no need for sleep) Strange or unusual thoughts or perceptions Symptoms that get worse or do not improve with treatment Thoughts of suicide or of harming others"
3707,What to expect if I have Schizoaffective disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with schizoaffective disorder have a greater chance of going back to their previous level of function than do people with most other psychotic disorders. However, long-term treatment is often needed, and results can vary from person to person."
3708,What are the symptoms of Schizoid personality disorder?,"A person with schizoid personality disorder:
Appears aloof and detached Avoids social activities that involve emotional intimacy with other people Does not want or enjoy close relationships, even with family members"
3709,What causes Schizoid personality disorder?,"The causes of schizoid personality disorder are unknown. This disorder may be related to schizophrenia and it shares many of the same risk factors.
However, schizoid personality disorder is not as disabling as schizophrenia. It does not cause hallucinations, delusions, or the complete disconnection from reality that occurs in untreated (or treatment-resistant) schizophrenia."
3710,What to expect if I have Schizoid personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Schizoid personality disorder is a long-term (chronic) illness that usually dos not improve much over time.
Social isolation often prevents the person from seeking the help or support that might improve the outcome.
Limiting emotional intimacy may help people with this condition make and keep connections with other people."
3711,What are the symptoms of Schizophrenia?,"Schizophrenia symptoms usually develop slowly over months or years. Sometimes you may have many symptoms, and at other times you may only have a few.
People with any type of schizophrenia may have difficulty functioning in social situations and working. They may also have problems with anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.
At first, you may have the following symptoms:
Irritability Difficulty sleeping Difficulty concentrating
As the illness continues, problems with thinking, emotions and behavior develop, including:
Lack of emotion (flat affect) Strongly held beliefs that are not based on reality (delusions) Hearing or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations) Problems paying attention Thoughts ""jump"" between unrelated topics (“loose associations”) Bizarre behaviors Social isolation
Symptoms can vary, depending on the type of schizophrenia you have.
Paranoid schizophrenia symptoms may include:
Anxious Angry or argumentative False believes that others are trying to harm you or your loved ones.
Disorganized schizophrenia symptoms may include:
Problems with thinking and expressing ideas clearly Childlike behavior Showing little emotion
Catatonic schizophrenia symptoms may include:
Lack of activity Muscles and posture may be rigid Grimaces or other odd expressions on the face Does not respond much to other people
Undifferentiated schizophrenia symptoms may include symptoms of more than one other type of schizophrenia.
People with residual schizophrenia have some symptoms, but not as many as those who are in a full-blown episode of schizophrenia."
3712,What causes Schizophrenia?,"Schizophrenia is a complex illness. Mental health experts are not sure what causes it. However, genetic factors appear to play a role.
Certain environmental events may trigger schizophrenia in people who are genetically at risk for it. You are more likely to develop schizophrenia if you have a family member with the disease.
Schizophrenia affects both men and women equally. It usually begins in the teen years or young adulthood, but may begin later in life. It tends to begin later in women, and is more mild.
Childhood-onset schizophrenia begins after age 5. Childhood schizophrenia is rare and can be difficult to tell apart from other developmental disorders of childhood, such as autism."
3713,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Schizophrenia ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Voices are telling you to hurt yourself or others. You feel the urge to hurt yourself or others. You are feeling hopeless or overwhelmed. You are seeing things that aren't really there. You feel you cannot leave the house. You are unable to care for yourself."
3714,What to expect if I have Schizophrenia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook for a person with schizophrenia is difficult to predict. Most of the time, symptoms improve with medication. However, others may have difficulty functioning and are at risk for repeated episodes, especially during the early stages of the illness.
People with schizophrenia may need supported housing, job training, and other community support programs. People with the most severe forms of this disorder may not be able to live alone. Group homes or other long-term, structured places to live may be needed.
Symptoms will return if a person with schizophrenia does not take their medication."
3715,What are the symptoms of Schizotypal personality disorder?,"People with schizotypal personality disorder may be very disturbed. Their odd behavior may look like that of people with schizophrenia. For example, they may also have unusual preoccupations and fears, such as fears of being monitored by government agencies.
More commonly, however, people with schizotypal personality disorder behave oddly and have unusual beliefs (such as aliens). They cling to these beliefs so strongly that it prevents them from having relationships.
People with schizotypal personality disorder feel upset by their difficulty in forming and keeping close relationships. This is different from people with schizoid personality disorder, who do not want to form relationships."
3716,What causes Schizotypal personality disorder?,"The exact cause is unknown. Genes are thought to be involved, because this condition is more common in relatives of schizophrenics.
Schizotypal personality disorder should not be confused with schizophrenia. People with schizotypal personality disorder can have odd beliefs and behaviors, but they are not disconnected from reality and usually do not hallucinate.
Hallucinations, delusions (fixed, false beliefs), and loss of touch with reality are hallmarks of psychosis. People with schizotypal personality disorder do not usually have psychotic symptoms.
Between 30% and 50% of people with schizotypal personality disorder also have a major depressive disorder. A second personality disorder, such as paranoid personality disorder, is also common with this condition."
3717,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Schizotypal personality disorder ?,"Talk to your health care provider or mental health professional if:
You have trouble forming and keeping relationships due to unusual beliefs You suspect that your child may have this problem"
3718,What to expect if I have Schizotypal personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Schizotypal personality disorder is usually a long-term (chronic) illness. The outcome of treatment varies based on the severity of the disorder.
3719,What is the difference between unilateral and bilateral vestibular schwannomas?,"Unilateral vestibular schwannoma s affect only one ear. They account for approximately 8 percent of all tumors inside the skull; one out of every 100,000 individuals per year develops a vestibular schwannoma. Symptoms may develop at any age but usually occur between the age s of 30 and 60 years. Unilateral vestibular schwannoma s are not hereditary.
Bilateral vestibular schwannoma s affect both hearing nerve s and are usually associated with a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2). Half of affected individuals have inherited the disorder from an affected parent and half seem to have a mutation for the first time in their family. Each child of an affected parent has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder. Unlike those with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma, individuals with NF2 usually develop symptoms in their teens or early adulthood. In addition, patients with NF2 usually develop multiple brain and spinal cord related tumors. They also can develop tumors of the nerves important for swallowing, speech, eye and facial movement, and facial sensation. Determining the best management of the vestibular schwannoma s as well as the additional nerve, brain, and spinal cord tumors is more complicated than deciding how to treat a unilateral vestibular schwannoma. Further research is needed to determine the best treatment for individuals with NF2."
3720,What are the symptoms of Schwannoma?,"The symptoms vary based on the size and location of the tumor. Because the tumors grow so slowly, symptoms usually start after the age of 30.
Common symptoms include:
Abnormal sensation of movement (vertigo) Hearing loss in the affected ear Ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear
Less common symptoms include:
Difficulty understanding speech Dizziness Headache
o Upon waking up in the morning o Wakes you from sleep o Worse when lying down o Worse when standing up o Worse when coughing, sneezing, straining, or lifting (Valsalva maneuver) o With nausea or vomiting
Loss of balance Numbness in the face or one ear Pain in the face or one ear Vision abnormalities that are temporary Weakness of the face"
3721,Who is at highest risk for Schwannoma ?,"Scientists believe that both unilateral and bilateral vestibular schwannomas form following the loss of the function of a gene on chromosome 22. (A gene is a small section of DNA responsible for a particular characteristic like hair color or skin tone). Scientists believe that this particular gene on chromosome 22 produces a protein that controls the growth of Schwann cells. When this gene malfunctions, Schwann cell growth is uncontrolled, resulting in a tumor. Scientists also think that this gene may help control the growth of other types of tumors. In neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, the faulty gene on chromosome 22 is inherited. For individuals with unilateral vestibular schwannoma, however, some scientists hypothesize that this gene somehow loses its ability to function properly.
These tumors are thought to occur when there is a defect in a gene that normally prevents tumors from forming. The cause of the genetic defect is not known. However, acoustic neuroma is often linked with the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).
Acoustic neuromas are relatively uncommon, but they are one of the most common types of brain tumors.
The tumor is usually found at the base of the brain."
3722,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Schwannoma ?,Call your health care provider if you experience new or worsening hearing loss or vertigo (dizziness).
3723,What to expect if I have Schwannoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acoustic neuromas are not cancer. They do not spread (metastasize) to other body systems, but they may continue to grow and press down on important structures in the skull."
3724,What are the symptoms of Seasonal affective disorder?,"Symptoms usually build up slowly in the late autumn and winter months.
Symptoms are usually the same as with depression:
Increased appetite with weight gain (weight loss is more common with other forms of depression) Increased sleep and daytime sleepiness (too little sleep is more common with other forms of depression) Less energy and ability to concentrate in the afternoon Loss of interest in work or other activities Slow, sluggish, lethargic movement Social withdrawal Unhappiness and irritability"
3725,What causes Seasonal affective disorder?,"The disorder may begin during the teen years or in early adulthood. Like other forms of depression, it occurs more often in women than in men.
People who live in places with long winter nights are at greater risk for SAD. A less common form of the disorder involves depression during the summer months.
Other factors that may make SAD more likely include:
Amount of light Body temperature Genes Hormones"
3726,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Seasonal affective disorder ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of seasonal affective disorder. Get help right away if you have thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else.
3727,What to expect if I have Seasonal affective disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is good with treatment. However, some people have the disorder throughout their lives."
3728,What are the symptoms of Secondary hyperparathyroidism?,"Symptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism include symptoms of chronic renal failure, malabsorption, rickets and underlying cancer. General symptoms are the following:
Weakness Bone deformities Poor growth, bowed limbs and swollen joints in children Bone pain Osteomalacia, osteoporosis Fractures"
3729,Who is at highest risk for Secondary hyperparathyroidism ?,"Kidney disease, chronic renal failure Rickets Malnutrition, malabsorption, vitamin D deficiency Certain types of cancer"
3730,What causes Secondary hyperparathyroidism?,"The parathyroid glands help control calcium use and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.
When calcium levels are too low, the body responds by increasing production of parathyroid hormone. This increase in parathyroid hormone causes more calcium to be taken from the bone and more calcium to be reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney.
Medical conditions that cause low blood calcium levels or interfere with the body's ability to break down and remove phosphate can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Too much phosphate causes changes in calcium levels.
Kidney failure is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Kidney failure can interfere with the body's ability to remove phosphate.
Other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism may include:
Calcium deficiency
Not enough calcium in the diet Too much calcium loss in the urine
Conditions that make it hard for the body to break down phosphate, including:
Aluminum poisoning Certain types of cancer Kidney disease Malnutrition Malabsorption
Vitamin D disorders (often seen in children with malnutrition and older adults who do not get enough sunlight):
Problems absorbing vitamin D into the body (malabsorption) Problems breaking down vitamin D (due to the use of certain drugs) Rickets Too little vitamin D (deficiency)"
3731,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Secondary hyperparathyroidism ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly if you are being treated for kidney disease. If you suffer either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Bone pain Fractures"
3732,What to expect if I have Secondary hyperparathyroidism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism depends on the underlying cause.
3733,What are the symptoms of Seizure?,"It may be hard to tell if someone is having a seizure. Some seizures only cause a person to have staring spells, which may go unnoticed. Specific symptoms of a seizure depend on what part of the brain is involved. They occur suddenly and may include:
Change in alertness; the person cannot remember a period of time Mood changes, such as unexplainable fear, panic, joy, or laughter Change in sensation of the skin, usually spreading over the arm, leg, or trunk Vision changes, including seeing flashing lights Rarely, hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) Falling, loss of muscle control, occurs very suddenly Muscle twitching that may spread up or down an arm or leg Muscle tension or tightening that causes twisting of the body, head, arms, or legs Shaking of the entire body Tasting a bitter or metallic flavor
Symptoms may stop after a few minutes, or continue for 15 minutes. They rarely continue longer."
3734,What causes Seizure?,"Unprovoked seizures are often associated with epilepsy and related seizure disorders.
Causes of provoked seizures include:
Sleep deprivation Cavernoma or cavernous malformation is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages. An MRI can quickly confirm or reject this as a cause. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages. An MRI can quickly confirm or reject this as a cause. Head injury may cause non-epileptic post-traumatic seizures or post-traumatic epilepsy, in which the seizures chronically recur. Intoxication with drugs Drug toxicity, for example aminophylline or local anaesthetics Normal doses of certain drugs that lower the seizure threshold, such as tricyclic antidepressants Infection, such as encephalitis or meningitis Fever leading to febrile convulsions (but see above) Metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycaemia, hyponatremia or hypoxia Withdrawal from drugs (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and sedatives such as alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines,) Space-occupying lesions in the brain (abscesses, tumors) Seizures during (or shortly after) pregnancy can be a sign of eclampsia. Seizures in a person with hydrocephalus may indicate severe shunt failure. Binaural beat brainwave entrainment may trigger seizures in both epileptics and non-epileptics Haemorrhagic stroke can occasionally present with seizures, embolic strokes generally do not (though epilepsy is a common later complication); cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare type of stroke, is more likely to be accompanied by seizures than other types of stroke Multiple sclerosis sufferers may rarely experience seizures
Some medications produce an increased risk of seizures and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) deliberately sets out to induce a seizure for the treatment of major depression. Many seizures have unknown causes.
Seizures which are provoked are not associated with epilepsy, and people who experience such seizures are normally not diagnosed with epilepsy. However, the seizures described above resemble those of epilepsy both outwardly, and on EEG testing.
Seizures can occur after a subject witnesses a traumatic event. This type of seizure is known as a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure and is related to posttraumatic stress disorder.
Mild seizures can be induced through a combination of quickly standing, hyperventilation and applying pressure to the sternum."
3735,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Seizure ?,"Call 911 or your local emergency number if:
A seizure occurs in a person who has never had one before It is an unusually long seizure in someone who has a seizure disorder
Report all seizures to the person's health care provider. The doctor may need to adjust or change the person's medications."
3736,What are the symptoms of Selective mutism?,"Ability to speak at home with family Failure to speak in certain social situations Fear of people Shyness
This pattern of mutism must be observed for at least 1 month. (The first month of school does not count, because shyness is common during this period.)"
3737,What causes Selective mutism?,"The cause of selective mutism is unknown. Most experts believe that children with the condition inherit a tendency to be anxious and inhibited. Most children with this condition have some form of extreme social phobia.
Parents often think that the child is refusing to speak, but usually the child is truly unable to speak in certain settings.
Some affected children have a family history of selective mutism, extreme shyness, or anxiety disorders, which may increase their risk for similar problems. This condition is most common in children under age 5.
This syndrome is not the same as mutism. In selective mutism, the child has the ability to both understand and speak, but fails to speak in certain settings or environments. Children with mutism never speak."
3738,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Selective mutism ?,"Call your health care provider if your child has symptoms of selective mutism, and it is affecting school and social activities."
3739,What to expect if I have Selective mutism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Children with this syndrome can have different outcomes. Some may need to continue therapy for shyness and social anxiety into the teenage years, and possibly into adulthood."
3740,What are the symptoms of Separation anxiety disorder?,Excessive distress when separated from the primary caregiver Nightmares Reluctance to go to school or other places because of fear of separation Reluctance to go to sleep without the primary caregiver nearby Repeated physical complaints Worry about losing or harm coming to the primary caregiver
3741,What causes Separation anxiety disorder?,"As infants develop, they experience various emotions, usually in a predictable order. Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they have little knowledge of what is ordinary and what may be dangerous, so new situations or experiences seem usual, and not frightening.
In normal development, during this early period the infant becomes familiar with the home environment, and feels comfortable when parents or other known caretakers are present. After this time, lack of familiarity often produces fear because the infant recognizes that something unusual is going on.
From 8 - 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, particularly when away from home, they feel threatened and unsafe.
Separation anxiety is a normal developmental stage. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master their environment.
It usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. There is also a normal desire to test their independence.
To get over separation anxiety, children must:
Feel safe in their home environment Trust people other than their parents Trust that their parents will return
Even after children have successfully mastered this developmental stage, separation anxiety may return during periods of stress. Most children will experience some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, especially when separated from their parents.
When children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are experiencing stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents. When parents cannot be with their children in these situations, the children experience distress.
This is why it is important to stay with your child as much as is possible during any medical procedures. Your presence can actually reduce the amount of pain the child experiences, as anxiety of any kind makes pain worse."
3742,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Separation anxiety disorder ?,Call your health care provider if your child has significant separation anxiety after age 2.
3743,What to expect if I have Separation anxiety disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Young children with symptoms that improve after age 2 are normal, even if some anxiety comes back later during stress.
When separation anxiety occurs in adolescence, it may signal the development of an anxiety disorder."
3744,What are the symptoms of Sepsis?,"In sepsis, blood pressure drops, resulting in shock. Major organs and body systems, including the kidneys, liver, lungs, and central nervous system, stop working properly.
A change in mental status and hyperventilation may be the earliest signs of sepsis. In general, symptoms of sepsis can include:
Chills Confusion or delirium Decreased urine output Fever or low body temperature (hypothermia) Hyperventilation Lightheadedness due to low blood pressure Rapid heart beat Shaking Skin rash Warm skin"
3745,What causes Sepsis?,"Sepsis is caused by a bacterial infection that can begin anywhere in the body. Common places where an infection might start include:
The bowel (usually seen with peritonitis) The kidneys (upper urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis) The lining of the brain (meningitis) The liver or the gall bladder The lungs (bacterial pneumonia) The skin (cellulitis)
In children, sepsis may accompany infection of the bone (osteomyelitis). In hospitalized patients, common sites of infection include intravenous lines, surgical wounds, surgical drains, and sites of skin breakdown known as bedsores (decubitus ulcers)."
3746,Who is at highest risk for Sepsis ?,Any infectious site can lead to sepsis if not taken proper care of.
3747,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sepsis ?,Call a doctor if you develop symptoms of sepsis
3748,What to expect if I have Sepsis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Sepsis is often life threatening, especially in people with a weakened immune system or with a chronic illness."
3749,What are the symptoms of Septic arthritis?,"Symptoms usually come on quickly. There is a fever, and joint swelling that is usually in just one joint. There is also intense joint pain, which gets worse with movement. Symptoms in newborns or infants:
Cries when infected joint is moved (example: diaper change causes crying if hip joint is infected) Fever Inability to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis) Irritability
Symptoms in children and adults:
Inability to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis) Intense joint pain Joint swelling Joint redness Low fever
Chills may occur, but are uncommon."
3750,What causes Septic arthritis?,Septic arthritis develops when bacteria or other tiny disease-causing organisms (microorganisms) spread through the bloodstream to a joint. It may also occur when the joint is directly infected with a microorganism from an injury or during surgery. The most common sites for this type of infection are the knee and hip. Most cases of acute septic arthritis are caused by bacteria such as staphylococcus or streptococcus. Chronic septic arthritis (which is less common) is caused by organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans.
3751,Who is at highest risk for Septic arthritis ?,"The following conditions increase your risk for septic arthritis:
Artificial joint implants Bacterial infection somewhere else in your body Chronic illness or disease (such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and sickle cell disease) Intravenous (IV) or injection drug use Medications that suppress your immune system Recent joint injury Recent joint arthroscopy or other surgery
Septic arthritis may be seen at any age. In children, it occurs most often in those younger than 3 years. The hip is often the site of infection in infants. Septic arthritis is uncommon from age 3 to adolescence. Children with septic arthritis are more likely than adults to be infected with Group B streptococcus or Haemophilus influenza, if they have not been vaccinated."
3752,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Septic arthritis ?,If you develop symptoms of septic arthritis contact your doctor.
3753,What to expect if I have Septic arthritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Recovery is good with prompt antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, permanent joint damage may result."
3754,What are the symptoms of Severe acute respiratory syndrome?,"The hallmark symptoms are fever greater than 100.4 degrees F (38.0 degrees C) and cough, difficulty breathing, or other respiratory symptoms. Symptoms in the order of how commonly they appeared have included:
Fever Chills and shaking Muscle aches Cough Headache
Less common symptoms include (also in order):
Dizziness Productive cough (sputum) Sore throat Runny nose Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea"
3755,What causes Severe acute respiratory syndrome?,"SARS is caused by a member of the coronavirus family (the same family that can cause the common cold).
When someone with SARS coughs or sneezes, infected droplets spray into the air. You can catch SARS if you breathe in or touch these particles. The SARS virus may live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to 6 hours in these droplets and up to 3 hours after the droplets have dried.
While droplet transmission through close contact was responsible for most of the early cases of SARS, evidence began to mount that SARS might also spread by hands and other objects the droplets had touched. Airborne transmission was a real possibility in some cases. Live virus had even been found in the stool of people with SARS, where it has been shown to live for up to four days. And the virus may be able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing.
With other coronaviruses, re-infection (becoming infected and falling ill again) is common. Preliminary reports suggest that this may also be the case with SARS.
Symptoms usually occur about 2 to 10 days after coming in contact with the virus, although there have been some cases where the illness started considerably sooner or later. Those with active symptoms of illness are clearly contagious, but it is not known how long a person may be contagious before or after symptoms."
3756,Who is at highest risk for Severe acute respiratory syndrome ?,"Since severe acute respiratory syndrome is contagious, anyone around a person with severe acute respiratory syndrome is at risk."
3757,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Severe acute respiratory syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you suspect you or someone you have had close contact with has SARS.
3758,What to expect if I have Severe acute respiratory syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"As the first wave of SARS began to subside, the death rate proved to have been about 14 or 15 percent of those diagnosed. In people over age 65, the death rate was higher than 50 percent. Many more were sick enough to require mechanical ventilation. And more still were sick enough to require hospitalization in intensive care units.
Intensive public health policies are proving to be effective in controlling outbreaks. Many nations have stopped the epidemic within their own countries. All nations must be vigilant, however, to keep this disease under control. Viruses in the coronavirus family are known for their ability to change (mutate) in order to better spread among humans."
3759,What are the Symptoms sexcord/ stromal ovarian tumors?,"Early sexcord/ stromal ovarian tumors does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Heavy feeling in pelvis Pain in lower abdomen Bleeding from the vagina Weight loss, loss of appetite Abnormal periods
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3760,What Causes sexcord/ stromal ovarian tumors?,"The exact cause of these tumors is unknown. Mutations in FOXL2, DICER1, STK11 are involved"
3761,Who is at highest risk for  stromal ovarian tumors ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of sexcord/ stromal ovarian tumors is related to several factors.
Some drugs or treatment protocols: Recent studies show that fertility drugs, androgens and estrogen replacement therapy may increase the risk. Pregnancy:Increasing age at first term pregnancy. Life-style: A rich-fat diet and obesity may increase the risk of getting ovarian cancer. Age: Clinical data suggest that age also plays a role in the development of some subtypes of stromal ovarian tumors. Preterm birth is risk factor for the developement."
3762,When to seek urgent medical care when I have  stromal ovarian tumors ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of ovarian cancer develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
A large amount of bleeding from the vagina"
3763,When to seek urgent medical care when I have  stromal ovarian tumors ?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Ovarian cancer
3764,What to expect if I have  stromal ovarian tumors  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of sexcord/ stromal ovarian tumors depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the ovaries Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred The patient’s general health"
3765,What are the symptoms of Sexually transmitted disease?,"The symptoms vary among the different types of STDs and may include-
Discharge from the penis or vagina Sores or warts on genital area Burning while urinating Itching and redness in the genital area Anal itching"
3766,What causes Sexually transmitted disease?,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that you can get from having sex with someone who has the infection. The causes of STDs are bacteria, parasites and viruses. There are more than 20 types of STDs, including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Herpes Simplex, HIV/AIDS, HPV, Syphilis, Trichomoniasis"
3767,Who is at highest risk for Sexually transmitted disease ?,Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that you can get from having sex with someone who has the infection.

3769,What to expect if I have Sexually transmitted disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Early and complete treatment has good prognosis. However, if not properly treated it can lead to adhesions in birth tube and infertility"
3770,What are the symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome?,"Symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome may include: Inability to breast-feed (breast milk never ""comes in"") Fatigue Lack of menstrual bleeding Loss of pubic and axillary hair Low blood pressure
Note: Symptoms other than inability to breast feed may not develop for several years after the delivery."
3771,What causes Sheehan's syndrome?,"Severe bleeding during childbirth can cause tissue death in the pituitary gland, which may cause the gland to lose its ability to function properly.
The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain. It normally produces hormones that stimulate breast milk production, growth, reproductive functions, the thyroid, and the adrenal glands. A lack of these hormones can lead to a variety of symptoms.
Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding during childbirth and Sheehan's syndrome include multiple pregnancies (twins or triplets) and problems with the placenta, the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the fetus.
Sheehan's syndrome is very rare."
3772,What to expect if I have Sheehan%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outlook with early diagnosis and treatment is excellent.
3773,What are the symptoms of Shigellosis?,"Symptoms usually develop about 1 to 7 days (average 3 days) after you come in contact with the bacteria.
Symptoms include:
Acute (sudden) abdominal pain or cramping Acute (sudden) fever Blood, mucus, or pus in stool Crampy rectal pain (tenesmus) Nausea and vomiting Watery diarrhea"
3774,What causes Shigellosis?,"Shigellosis is caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella.
There are several types of Shigella.
Shigella sonnei, also called ""group D"" Shigella, is responsible for most cases of shigellosis in the United States. Shigella flexneri, or ""group B"" Shigella, cause almost all other cases. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 is rare in the U.S. but can lead to deadly outbreaks in developing countries.
People infected with the bacteria release it into their stool. The bacteria can spread from an infected person to contaminate water or food, or directly to another person. Getting just a little bit of the Shigella bacteria into your mouth is enough to cause symptoms."
3775,Who is at highest risk for Shigellosis ?,"Outbreaks of shigellosis are associated with poor sanitation, contaminated food and water, and crowded living conditions.
Shigellosis is common among travelers in developing countries and workers or residents of refugee camps.
The condition is most commonly seen in day care centers and group living places."
3776,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Shigellosis ?,"Call your provider if diarrhea does not improve, if there is blood in the stool, or if there are signs of dehydration.
Go to the emergency room if the following occur in a person with shigellosis:
Confusion Headache with stiff neck Lethargy Seizures
Such symptoms are most common in children."
3777,What to expect if I have Shigellosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Often the infection is mild and goes away on its own. Most patients, except malnourished children and those with weakened immune systems, have an excellent outlook."
3778,What are the symptoms of Sialolithiasis?,Difficulty opening the mouth or swallowing Dry mouth Pain in the face or mouth Swelling of the face or neck (can be dramatic when eating or drinking)
3779,What causes Sialolithiasis?,"Saliva (spit) is produced by the salivary glands in the mouth. The chemicals in saliva can crystallize into a stone that can block the salivary ducts. When saliva cannot exit a blocked duct, it backs up into the gland, causing pain and swelling of the gland. There are three pairs of major salivary glands: The two largest are the parotid glands, one in each cheek over the jaw in front of the ears. Two submandibular glands are at the back of the mouth on both sides of the jaw. Two sublingual glands are under the floor of the mouth."
3780,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sialolithiasis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of salivary duct stones.
3781,What to expect if I have Sialolithiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Salivary duct stones are uncomfortable, but usually not dangerous. The stone is usually removed with only minimal discomfort. Some people may feel more pain.
If the person has repeated stones or infections, the affected salivary gland may need to be surgically removed."
3782,What are the symptoms of Sickle-cell disease?,"Symptoms usually don't occur until after age 4 months.
Almost all patients with sickle cell anemia have painful episodes (called crises), which can last from hours to days. These crises can affect the bones of the back, the long bones, the chest, and various other organs.
Some patients have one episode every few years. Others have many episodes per year. The crises can be severe enough to require a hospital stay.
Common symptoms include:
Attacks of abdominal pain Bone pain Breathlessness Delayed growth and puberty Fatigue Fever Paleness Rapid heart rate Ulcers on the lower legs (in adolescents and adults) Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)
Other symptoms include:
Chest pain Excessive thirst Frequent urination Painful and prolonged erection (priapism - occurs in 10 - 40% of men with the disease) Poor eyesight/blindness Strokes Skin ulcers"
3783,What causes Sickle-cell disease?,"Sickle cell anemia is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S.
Hemoglobin is a protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin S changes the shape of red blood cells, especially when the cells are exposed to low oxygen levels. The red blood cells become shaped like crescents or sickles. The fragile, sickle-shaped cells deliver less oxygen to the body's tissues. They can also get stuck more easily in small blood vessels, and break into pieces that interupt healthy blood flow.
Sickle cell anemia is inherited from both parents. If you inherit the hemoglobin S gene from one parent and normal hemoglobin (A) from your other parent, you will have sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait do not have the symptoms of sickle cell anemia. In order to get sickle cell disease, both of your parents must have at least 1 defective gene. If both of your parents have sickle cell trait, then there is a 25% chance that you will get sickle cell disease."
3784,Who is at highest risk for Sickle-cell disease ?,"Sickle cell disease is much more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent. It is also seen in people from South and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East."
3785,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sickle-cell disease ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
Painful crises Any symptoms of infection (fever, body aches, headache, fatigue) Breathlessless"
3786,What to expect if I have Sickle-cell disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In the past, sickle cell patients often died from organ failure between ages 20 and 40. Thanks to a better understanding and management of the disease, today, patients can live into their 50s or beyond.
Causes of death include organ failure and infection. Some people with the disease experience minor, brief, infrequent episodes. Others experience severe, long-term, frequent episodes with many complications."
3787,What are the symptoms of Sideroblastic anemia?,Headache Weaknes Fatigue Breathing difficulty Rapid pulse Irritibility Chest pain
3788,What causes Sideroblastic anemia?,"Sideroblastic anemia can be caused by heriditory or acquired factors.
Heriditory causes of sideroblastic anemia include
Mutations in ALAS2, ABCB7, SCL19A2, GLRX5 and PSU1 genes. Pearson syndrome DIDMOAD syndrome Mitochondrial SLC25A38 Erythropoietic protoporphyria Acquired causes of sideroblastic anemia include: Myelodysplastic syndrome Nutritional deficiencies (copper, vitamin B6) Lead poisoning Zinc overdose Alcohol Drugs (anti-tuberculous agents, antibiotics, progesterone, chelators, busulfan) Hypothermia"
3789,Who is at highest risk for Sideroblastic anemia ?,Common risk factors in the development of sideroblastic anemia are Male gender (X-linked SA) Family history of hereditary SA Chronic alcohol abuse Lead toxicity Drugs Isoniazid Pyrazinamide Chloramphenicol Cycloserine Azathioprine Copper deficiency Pyridoxine deficiency Hypothermia affecting mitochondrial functions High dose zinc supplemets
3790,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sideroblastic anemia ?,"You should go to urgent care immediatly if you experience:
Chest pain Difficulty breathing Severe abdominal pain Bleeding from gums or nose Extreme weakness Fever"
3791,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sideroblastic anemia ?,Medical care for (Sideroblastic anemia) can be found here.
3792,What to expect if I have Sideroblastic anemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease. Finding the cause is the main factor which determines the prognosis
3793,What are the symptoms of Silicosis?,"Chronic cough Shortness of breath with exercise, usually in patients who have progressive massive fibrosis
Other symptoms of this disease, especially in acute silicosis:
Cough Fever Severe breathing difficulty Weight loss"
3794,What causes Silicosis?,"Silica is a common, naturally-occurring crystal. It is found in most rock beds and forms dust during mining, quarrying, tunneling, and working with many metal ores. Silica is a main part of sand, so glass workers and sand-blasters are also exposed to silica.
Three types of silicosis exist:
Simple chronic silicosis -- results from long-term exposure (more than 20 years) to low amounts of silica dust. Swellings caused by the silica dust form in the lungs and chest lymph nodes. This disease may cause people to have trouble breathing.
Accelerated silicosis -- occurs after exposure to larger amounts of silica over a shorter period of time (5 - 15 years). Swelling in the lungs and symptoms occur faster than in simple silicosis.
Acute silicosis -- results from short-term exposure to very large amounts of silica. The lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, causing severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels.
Progressive massive fibrosis can occur in either simple or accelerated silicosis, but is more common in the accelerated form. Progressive massive fibrosis is caused by severe scarring and destroys normal lung structures.
Intense exposure to silica can cause disease within a year, but it usually takes at least 10 - 15 years of exposure before symptoms occur. Silicosis has become less common since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) created regulations requiring the use of protective equipment, which limits the amount of silica dust workers inhale."
3795,Who is at highest risk for Silicosis ?,"People who work in jobs where they are exposed to silica dust are at risk. These jobs include:
Abrasives manufacturing
Mining
Quarrying
Road and building construction
Sand blasting
Stone cutting"
3796,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Silicosis ?,Call your health care provider if you are exposed to silica at work and you have symptoms of the disease.
3797,What to expect if I have Silicosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome varies depending on the amount of damage to the lungs.
3798,What are the symptoms of Sleep disorders?,The symptoms vary and depend on the specific sleep disorder.
3799,What causes Sleep disorders?,"Disorders of sleeping and waking can be grouped in four main categories:
Problems with falling and staying asleep (insomnia) Problems with staying awake (excessive daytime sleepiness) Problems with sticking to a regular sleep schedule (sleep rhythm problem) Unusual behavoirs during sleep (sleep-disruptive behaviors)
PROBLEMS WITH FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP:
Insomnia includes any combination of difficulty with falling asleep, staying asleep, intermittent wakefulness and early-morning awakening. Episodes may come and go (be transient), last as long as 2 to 3 weeks (be short-term), or be long-lasting (chronic).
Common factors associated with insomnia include:
Physical illness Depression Anxiety or stress Poor sleeping environment such as excessive noise or light Caffeine Alcohol or other drugs Use of certain medications Heavy smoking Physical discomfort Daytime napping Counterproductive sleep habits: Early bedtimes Excessive time spent awake in bed
Disorders include:
Psycho-physiological insomnia: a condition in which stress caused by the insomnia makes it even harder to fall asleep Delayed sleep phase syndrome: your internal clock is constantly out of synch with the accepted day/night phases; for example, patients feel best if they can sleep from 4 AM to noon Hypnotic-dependent sleep disorder: insomnia that occurs when you stop or become tolerant to certain types of sleep medications Stimulant-dependent sleep disorder: insomnia that occurs when you stop or become dependent on certain types of stimulants
PROBLEMS WITH STAYING AWAKE:
Disorders of excessive sleepiness are called hypersomnias.
These include:
Idiopathic hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness that occurs without an identifiable cause) Narcolepsy Obstructive and central sleep apnea Periodic limb movement disorder Restless leg syndrome
PROBLEMS STICKING TO A REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE:
Problems may also occur when you do not maintain a consistent sleep and wake schedule. This occurs when traveling between times zones and with shift workers on rotating schedules, particularly nighttime workers.
Sleep disruption disorders include:
Irregular sleep-wake syndrome Jet lag syndrome Natural short sleeper (the person sleeps fewer hours than normal but has no ill effects) Paradoxical insomnia (the person actually sleeps a different amount than they think they do) Shift work sleep disorder
SLEEP-DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORS:
Abnormal behaviors during sleep are called parasomnias and are fairly common in children.
They include:
Sleep terrors Sleep walking REM sleep-behavior disorder (a type of psychosis in which a person ""acts out"" dreams so violently that they may injure the person sleeping with them)"
3800,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sleep disorders ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if lack of sleep, too much sleep, or unusual sleep behaviors are interfering with daily living.
Sleep apnea should be suspected in people who snore loudly, wake frequently to urinate at night, and wake up in the morning unrefreshed."
3801,What to expect if I have Sleep disorders  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome varies with the type of disorder. Some disorders may go away without treatment.
3802,What are the symptoms of Sleep disorders in the elderly?,Difficulty falling asleep Difficulty telling the difference between night and day Early morning awakening Waking up often during the night
3803,What causes Sleep disorders in the elderly?,"Sleep problems are common in the elderly. In general, older people need 30 to 60 minutes less sleep than younger people. Their sleep is less deep and more choppy than sleep in younger people. A healthy 70 year old may wake up four times during the night without it being due to disease.
Some causes or contributors to sleep disturbances in older adults include:
Alzheimer's disease Chronic disease, such as congestive heart failure Depression (depression is a common cause of sleep problems in people of all ages) Neurological conditions Pain caused by diseases such as arthritis Prescription drugs, recreational drugs, or alcohol Sedentary lifestyle Stimulants such as caffeine Urination at night"
3804,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sleep disorders in the elderly ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if a lack of sleep or too much sleep is interfering with daily living.
3805,What to expect if I have Sleep disorders in the elderly  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"For most people, sleep improves with treatment. However, others may continue to have sleep disruptions."
3806,What are the symptoms of Sleep paralysis?,"People with isolated sleep paralysis have episodes that last from a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes in which they are unable to move or speak.
These spells end on their own or when the person is touched or moved. Rarely, the person may have dream-like sensations or hallucinations, which may be scary to them."
3807,What causes Sleep paralysis?,"Isolated sleep paralysis is more likely to happen during the first two hours of sleep. Not getting enough sleep or sleeping on the back may cause more frequent episodes.
Though this condition may occur with narcolepsy, many people who do not have narcolepsy have isolated sleep paralysis. It is common in adults and is also seen in children.
Most people with isolated sleep paralysis do not have any mental health problems. However, these episodes seem to occur more often in people with:
Anxiety disorders Bipolar illness Depression Post traumatic stress disorder
Rarely, it runs in families."
3808,What are the symptoms of Sleeping sickness?,"African trypanosomiasis symptoms occur in two stages. The first stage is known as the haemo-lymphatic phase and is characterized by fever, headaches, and joint pains, and itching. Invasion of the circulatory and lymphatic system by the parasites is associated with severe swelling of lymph nodes, often to tremendous sizes. If left untreated, the disease overcomes the host's defenses and can cause more extensive damage, broadening symptoms to include anemia, endocrine, cardiac, and kidney dysfunctions. The second stage, called the neurological phase, begins when the parasite invades the central nervous system by passing through the blood-brain barrier. The term'sleeping sickness' comes from the symptoms of the neurological phase. The symptoms include confusion, reduced coordination, and disruption of the sleep cycle, with bouts of fatigue punctuated with manic periods leading to daytime slumber and night-time insomnia. Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal, with progressive mental deterioration leading to coma and death. Damage caused in the neurological phase can be irreversible.
General symptoms include:
Anxiety Drowsiness Fever Headache Increased sleepiness Insomnia at night Mood changes Sweating Swollen lymph nodes all over the body Swollen, red, painful nodule at site of fly bite Uncontrollable urge to sleep"
3809,What causes Sleeping sickness?,"Tsetse flies carry the infection. When an infected fly bites you, painful, red swelling occurs at the site of the bite. The infection then spreads through your blood, causing episodes of fever, headache, sweating, and swelling of the lymph nodes. When the infection spreads to the central nervous system, it causes the symptoms typical of sleeping sickness. When it reaches the brain, behavioral changes such as fear and mood swings occur, followed by a headache, fever, and weakness. Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may develop. In addition to the bite of the tsetse fly, the disease can be transmitted in the following ways:
Mother to child infection: the trypanosome can sometimes cross the placenta and infect the fetus. Laboratories: accidental infections, for example, through the handling of blood of an infected person and organ transplantation, although this is uncommon. Blood transfusion Sexual contact (might be possible, but happens rarely)"
3810,Who is at highest risk for Sleeping sickness ?,Risk factors include living in parts of Africa where the disease is found and being bitten by tsetse flies. The disease is extremely rare in the United States and is only found in travelers who have visited or lived in those African areas.
3811,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sleeping sickness ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of this disorder. It is important to begin treatment as soon as possible.
3812,What to expect if I have Sleeping sickness  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, death may occur within 6 months from cardiac failure or from rhodesiense infection itself. Gambiense infection causes the classic ""sleeping sickness"" disease and gets worse more quickly, often over a few weeks. Both diseases should be treated immediately."
3813,What are the symptoms of Small cell carcinoma?,"Bloody sputum (phlegm) Chest pain Cough Loss of appetite Shortness of breath Weight loss Wheezing
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Facial swelling Fever Hoarseness or changing voice Swallowing difficulty Weakness"
3814,What causes Small cell carcinoma?,"About 15% of all lung cancer cases are small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer(SCLC) is slightly more common in men than women.
Almost all cases of SCLC are due to cigarette smoking. SCLC is rare in those who have never smoked.
SCLC is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. It usually starts in the breathing tubes (bronchi) in the center of the chest. Although the cancer cells are small, they grow very quickly and create large tumors. These tumors often spread rapidly (metastasize) to other parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and bone."
3815,Who is at highest risk for Small cell carcinoma ?,Usually seen in middle aged and elderly History of smoking for many years
3816,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Small cell carcinoma ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of lung cancer (particularly if you smoke).
3817,What to expect if I have Small cell carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well you do depends on how much the lung cancer has spread. This type of cancer is very deadly. Only about 6% of people with this type of cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis.
Treatment can often prolong life for 6 - 12 months, even when the cancer has spread."
3818,What are the symptoms of Small cell carcinoma of the lung?,"Early small cell carcinoma of the lung does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Cough that does not go away
Chest pain
Hoarseness
Weight loss and loss of appetite
Bloody sputum
Shortness of breath
Iterative infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia
New onset of wheezing
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3819,What causes Small cell carcinoma of the lung?,"About 15% of all lung cancer cases are small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is slightly more common in men than women.
Almost all cases of SCLC are due to cigarette smoking. SCLC is rare in those who have never smoked.
SCLC is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. It usually starts in the breathing tubes (bronchi) in the center of the chest. Although the cancer cells are small, they grow very quickly and create large tumors. These tumors often spread rapidly (metastasize) to other parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and bone."
3820,Who is at highest risk for Small cell carcinoma of the lung ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of small cell carcinoma of the lung is related to several factors.
Smoking: Clinical data show that smoking is by far the leading risk factor for lung cancer, especially for small cell carcinoma of the lung. Women and children are the usual victims to secondhand smoke.
Radon: As a radioactive gas, radon increases the risk of small cell carcinoma of the lung.
Asbestos: Epidemiological survey suggests people who work with asbestos have a higher risk of developing lung cancer, especially for small cell carcinoma of the lung."
3821,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Small cell carcinoma of the lung ?,"Lung cancer is a tumor that cannot be found early. If symptoms of lung cancer develop, go to see your doctor as soon as possible:
Severe cough that does not go away
Severe chest pain
A large amount of bloody sputum
Severe shortness of breath"
3822,What to expect if I have Small cell carcinoma of the lung  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"For most patients with small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. The prognosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung depend on the following:
The stage of the cancer
The blood level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
The patient’s gender and general health"
3823,What are the symptoms of small intestine cancer?,"Early stomach cancer does not make any symptoms. When the cancer grows larger, people may notice one or more symptoms as the following:
Abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain: It is relatively mild pain or no pain may be present with life-threatening condition. With the development of the cancer, abdominal pain may be persistent. Weight loss: This is because of the consumption of the cancer. Weakness and fatigue: The reason is also because the cancer wastes your energy.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3824,Who is at risk for small intestine cancer?,"There are some factors may increase the risk of acquiring small intestine cancer potentially. These risk factors are outlined in the table below:
Crohns disease: Crohns disease is a kind of immune system disease in small intestine. This disease can affect any part of the small intestine, especially in the ileum. Patients with this problem have a risk of 28 times higher than normal to develope cancer. Celiac disease: This can also known as celiac sprue and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. As an immune system disease, the body makes antibodies that attack the lining of the intestines. Clinical survey show that patients with celiac disease have an increased risk of small intestine cancers. Some inherited causes such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) and cystic fibrosis (CF) Smoking and alcohol abuse Age: Small intestinal cancer becomes more common as people get older. Gender: Men have higher risk than women to develope small intestine cancer."
3825,How to know you have small intestine cancer?,"It is hard to diagnose small intestine cancer in its early stages. Other problems can also cause the same symptoms such as stomach discomfort and other digestive system cancer. So, if you have those symptoms, you had better go to see your doctor to do some tests. They include lab tests, image tests and endoscopy.
Capsule endoscopy: In this procedure, the patient is not detected with an actual endoscope but with a capsule (about the size of a large vitamin pill) which contains a light source and a very small camera. After swallowed, the capsule goes through the small intestine for a period of 8 hours. It takes thousands of pictures which can be downloaded onto a computer for the doctor to analyze. Double balloon enteroscopy and biopsy: This is a newer way of looking at the small intestine. At first the patient need to anesthesia. This technology makes the doctor to see the intestine a foot at a time and even take a biopsy if something abnormal. Barium x-rays: This is an x-ray test that a person is given a medication that will temporarily slow bowel movement, so structures can be more easily seen on the x-rays. For this test, the patient drinks a millkshake-like substance called barium. X-ray method called fluroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Pictures are taken in a variety of positions. It includes upper GI series, enteroclysis and a barium enema. Computed tomography (CT) scan: CT scans are often used to diagnose small intestine cancer. It can confirm the location of the cancer and show the organs near the small intestine, as well as lymph nodes and distant organs where the cancer might have spread. These are helpful in staging the cancer and in determining whether surgery is a good treatment option."
3826,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Small intestine cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of small intestine cancer develop. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain: The reason of a person with small intestine cancer appears severe abdominal pain is sometimes because of samll intestine wall perforation or obstruction of small intestine canal. This is the results of cancer development. A surgery will be done urgently."
3827,What to expect if I have Small intestine cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of small intestine cancer depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the small intestine The patient’s general health Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
3828,What are the symptoms of Smallpox?,Raised pink rash - turns into sores that become crusty on day 14 Delirium Diarrhea Excessive bleeding Fatigue Severe Headaches High Fever (102-104 Fahrenheit) Malaise Pain Vomiting
3829,What causes Smallpox?,"Smallpox is caused by the variola virus that emerged in human populations thousands of years ago. Except for laboratory stockpiles, the variola virus has been eliminated."
3830,Who is at highest risk for Smallpox ?,"Today that the disease has been eradicated, people who work in laboratories with the virus or people who live in an area victim of bioterrorism are at higher risk of being infected. Before the eradication, people at higher risk were the ones who had physical contact with infected patients, with contaminated surfaces or with infected aerosolized particles."
3831,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Smallpox ?,"If you think you may have been exposed to smallpox, contact your health care provider immediately. Because smallpox has been wiped out this would be very unlikely, unless you have worked with the virus in a laboratory or there has been an act of bioterrorism."
3832,What to expect if I have Smallpox  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,30% exposed may become infected 30% of those infected may die Arthritis and bone infections Brain swelling (encephalitis) Death Eye infections Pneumonia Scarring Severe bleeding Skin infections (from the sores)
3833,What are the symptoms of Social phobia?,"People with social phobia become overwhelmingly anxious and self-conscious in everyday social situations. They have an intense, persistent, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others, and of doing things that will embarrass them. They can worry for days or weeks before a dreaded situation. This fear may become so severe that it interferes with work, school, and other ordinary activities, and can make it hard to make and keep friends.
Although many people with social phobia realize that their fears about being with people are excessive or unreasonable, they are unable to overcome them on their own.
Social phobia can be limited to one situation (such as talking to people, eating or drinking, or writing on a blackboard in front of others). Or, it may be so broad (such as in generalized social phobia) that the person experiences anxiety around almost everyone other than family members.
Physical symptoms that often occur with social phobia include:
Blushing Difficulty talking Nausea Profuse sweating Trembling
Social phobia is different from shyness. Shy people are able to participate in social functions. People with social phobia are constrained by their condition to the point that it affects their ability to function in work and relationships.
Some of the most common fears of people with social phobia include:
Attending parties and other social occasions Eating, drinking, and writing in public Meeting new people Speaking in public Using public restrooms"
3834,What causes Social phobia?,"People with social phobias fear and avoid situations in which they may be subject to the scrutiny of others.
It may begin in adolescence and may be associated with overprotective parents or limited social opportunities.
Males and females are affected equally with this disorder.
People with social phobia are at high risk for alcohol or other drug dependence, because they may come to rely on drinks or drugs to relax in social situations."
3835,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Social phobia ?,Call your health care provider or mental health professional if fear is affecting your work and relationships with others.
3836,What to expect if I have Social phobia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is generally good with treatment, and antidepressant medications have been shown to be very effective."
3837,What are the symptoms of soft tissue sarcoma?,"Early soft tissue sarcoma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
A new lump or a lump that is growing anywhere on your body
Abdominal pain
Hematochezia or hematemesis
Black, tarry stools
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3838,Who is at risk for soft tissue sarcoma?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of soft tissue sarcoma is related to several factors.
Radiation exposure:Clinical stidies suggest that patients with other kind of cancers such as lymphoma and breast cancer may develop sarcomas from radiation therapy. The sarcoma often happens in the area of the body that had been treated with radiation.
Damaged lymph system: Clinical observations demonstrate lymphangiosarcoma is a very rare complication of chronic lymphedema that is the result of damaged lymph system.
Inherited conditions: Some inherited conditions may increase the risk of developing soft tissue sarcomas, such as neurofibromatosis, Gardner syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Retinoblastoma, Werner syndrome, etc."
3839,How to know you have soft tissue sarcoma?,"Biopsy: A biopsy is the most important test for the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma. In this procedure, the doctor usually performs a punch biopsy and removes a tiny round piece of tissue. Then, the pathologists can detect the tissues under the microcope.
Computed tomography (CT) scan and biopsy: Local CT scans are often used to diagnose soft tissue sarcoma. It can confirm the location of the cancer and show the organs nearby. These are helpful for determining the stage of the cancer and in determining whether surgery is a good treatment option. CT scans can also be used to guide biopsy and a biopsy sample is usually removed and looked at under a microscope.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI uses magnetic fields but it is a different type of image than what is produced by computed tomography (CT) and produces detailed images of the body. Like computed tomography (CT), a contrast agent may be injected into a patient’s vein to create a better picture.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan: When doing this test, a small amount of a radioactive medium is injected into your body and absorbed by the organs or tissues. This radioactive substance gives off energy which in turn is used to produce the images. PET can provide more helpful information than either CT or MRI scans. It is useful to see if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and it is also useful for your doctor to locate where the cancer has spread.
Chest X-ray: This plain x-ray of your chest may be done to see if the cancer has spread to your lungs.
Whole Bone Scan: The goal of a whole body bone scan is to show if a cancer has metastasized to your bones."
3840,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Soft tissue sarcoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of soft tissue sarcoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain
Hemorrhage in gastrointestinal tract such as hematochezia or hematemesis, or even shock"
3841,What to expect if I have Soft tissue sarcoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of soft tissue sarcoma is poor and it depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery
The stage of the sarcoma: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the location
The patient’s general health
Whether the sarcoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
3842,What are the symptoms of Somatoform disorder?,"The main symptom of somatoform pain disorder is chronic pain that lasts for several months and limits a person's work, relationships, and other activities.
Patients are often very worried or stressed about their pain."
3843,What causes Somatoform disorder?,"In the past, this disorder was thought to be related to emotional stress. The pain was often said to be ""all in their head.""
However, patients with somatoform pain disorder seem to experience painful sensations in a way that increases their pain level. Pain and worry create a cycle that is hard to break.
People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have this disorder. However, not every person with somatoform pain disorder has a history of abuse.
As researchers learn more about the connections between the brain and body, there is more evidence that emotional well-being affects the way in which pain is perceived."
3844,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Somatoform disorder ?,Call your health care provider if you or your child experiences chronic pain.
3845,What to expect if I have Somatoform disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook is worse for patients who have had symptoms for a long time. Your outlook will improve if you can start doing your previous activities, even with the pain.
Seeking out a mental health professional who has experience treating people with chronic pain has been shown to improve outcomes."
3846,What are the symptoms of Spina bifida?,"A newborn may have a sac sticking out of the mid to lower back. The doctor cannot see through the sac when shining a light behind it.
Symptoms include:
Loss of bladder or bowel control Partial or complete lack of sensation Partial or complete paralysis of the legs Weakness of the hips, legs, or feet of a newborn
Other symptoms may include:
Abnormal feet or legs, such as clubfoot Build up of fluid inside the skull (hydrocephalus) Hair at the back part of the pelvis called the sacral area Dimpling of the sacral area"
3847,What causes Spina bifida?,"Normally, during the first month of a pregnancy, the two sides of the spine (or backbone) join together to cover the spinal cord, spinal nerves and meninges (the tissues covering the spinal cord). Spina bifida refers to any birth defect involving incomplete closure of the spine.
Myelomeningocele is the most common type of spina bifida. It is a neural tube defect in which the bones of the spine do not completely form, resulting in an incomplete spinal canal. This causes the spinal cord and meninges (the tissues covering the spinal cord) to stick out of the child's back.
Myelomeningocele may affect as many as 1 out of every 800 infants.
The rest of spina bifida cases are most commonly:
Spina bifida occulta, a condition in which the bones of the spine do not close but the spinal cord and meninges remain in place and skin usually covers the defect Meningoceles, a condition where the tissue covering the spinal cord sticks out of the spinal defect but the spinal cord remains in place.
Other congenital disorders or birth defects may also be present in a child with myelomeningocele. Hydrocephalus may affect as many as 90% of children with myelomeningocele. Other disorders of the spinal cord or musculoskeletal system may be seen, including syringomyelia and hip dislocation.
The cause of myelomeningocele is unknown. However, low levels of folic acid in a woman's body before and during early pregnancy is thought to play a part in this type of birth defect. The vitamin folic acid (or folate) is important for brain and spinal cord development.
Also, if a child is born with myelomeningocele, future children in that family have a higher risk than the general population. However, in many cases, there is no family connection.
Some theorize that a virus make play a role, since there is a higher rate of this condition in children born in the early winter months. Research also indicates possible environmental factors such as radiation."
3848,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Spina bifida ?,"Call your health care provider if:
A sac sticks out of the spine of a newborn infant. The child is late in walking or crawling Symptoms of hydrocephalus develop, including bulging soft spot, irritability, extreme sleepiness, and feeding difficulties Symptoms of Meningitis menigitis develop, including fever, stiff neck, irritability, and a high-pitched cry"
3849,What to expect if I have Spina bifida  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A myelomeningocele can usually be surgically corrected. With treatment, length of life is not severely affected. Neurological damage is often irreversible.
New problems within the spinal cord can develop later in life, especially after the child begins growing rapidly during puberty. This can lead to more loss of function as well as orthopedic problems such as scoliosis, foot or ankle deformities, dislocated hips, and joint tightness or contractures.
Many patients with myelomeningocele primarily use a wheelchair."
3850,What are the symptoms of Spinal cord compression?,"Back pain Increased muscle tone (spasticity) Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms) Numbness Sensory changes Weakness Paralysis"
3851,What causes Spinal cord compression?,Any trauma to back Tumor Disc prolapse Vertebral compression fractures An abscess or blood clot around the spine
3852,Who is at highest risk for Spinal cord compression ?,"People with underlying spine disease are at high risk of developing spinal cord compression than normal people.
Cervical spondylosis Atlantoaxial instability Congenital conditions (tethered cord) Osteoporosis Ankylosing spondylitis Rheumatoid arthritis of the cervical spine"
3853,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Spinal cord compression ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of spinal cord compression"
3854,What to expect if I have Spinal cord compression  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis is poor even with adequate treatment if the syndrome is complete (quadriparesis and with no sensory preservation), and recovery is less than 5%."
3855,What are the symptoms of Spinal disc herniation?,"Low back or neck pain can vary widely. It may feel like a mild tingling, dull ache, or a burning or pulsating sensation. In some cases, the pain is severe enough that you are unable to move. You may also have numbness.
The pain most often occurs on one side of the body.
With a lumbar (lower back) herniated disc, you may have sharp pain in one part of the leg, hip, or buttocks and numbness in other parts. You may also feel the sensations on the back of the calf or sole of the foot. The affected leg may feel weak. With a cervical (neck) disc herniation, you may have pain when moving your neck, deep pain near or over the shoulder blade, or pain that radiates to the upper arm, forearm, or (rarely) fingers.
The pain often starts slowly. It may get worse:
After standing or sitting At night When sneezing, coughing, or laughing When bending backwards or walking more than a few yards, especially if it is caused by spinal stenosis
You may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your doctor examines you. In other cases, you will notice that you have a hard time lifting your leg or arm, standing on your toes on one side, squeezing tightly with one of your hands, or other problems.
The pain, numbness, or weakness often will go away or improve a lot over a period of weeks to months.
Other diseases with similar symptoms are:
Spondylolysis Spondylolisthesis"
3856,What causes Spinal disc herniation?,"The bones (vertebrae) of the spinal column run down the back, connecting the skull to the pelvis. These bones protect nerves that come out of the brain and travel down your back, forming the spinal cord. Nerve roots are large nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and leave your spinal column between each vertebrae.
The spinal vertebrae are separated by discs filled with a soft, gelatinous substance. These discs cushion the spinal column and space between your vertebrae. These discs may herniate (move out of place) or rupture from trauma or strain. When this happens, the spinal nerves may become compressed, resulting in pain, numbness, or weakness. The lower back (lumbar area) of the spine is the most common area for a slipped disc. The cervical (neck) discs are affected 8% of the time. The upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) discs are rarely involved.
Radiculopathy refers to any disease that affects the spinal nerve roots. A herniated disc is one cause of radiculopathy (sciatica).
Disc herniation occurs more frequently in middle-aged and older men, especially those involved in strenuous physical activity. Other risk factors include any conditions present at birth (congenital) that affect the size of the lumbar spinal canal."
3857,Who is at highest risk for Spinal disc herniation ?,"People that have the following factors may be at risk:
Age. Herniated discs are most common in middle age, especially between 35 and 45, due to aging-related degeneration of the discs. Smoking. Smoking tobacco increases your risk of disc herniation because it decreases oxygen levels in your blood, depriving your body tissues of vital nutrients. Weight. Excess body weight causes extra stress on the discs in your lower back. Height. Being tall increases your risk of disc herniation. Men taller than 5 feet 11 inches (180 centimeters) and women taller than 5 feet 7 inches (170 centimeters) appear to have a greater risk of a herniated disc. Occupations that strain your spine. People with physically demanding jobs have a greater risk of back problems. Repetitive lifting, pulling, pushing, bending sideways and twisting also may increase your risk of a herniated disc. Jobs that require prolonged sitting or standing in one position also may increase your risk of disc herniation."
3858,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Spinal disc herniation ?,"Call your health care provider if:
you develop persistent, severe back pain you have any numbness, loss of movement, weakness, or bowel / bladder changes"
3859,What to expect if I have Spinal disc herniation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most people will improve with conservative treatment. A small percentage may continue to have chronic back pain even after treatment.
It may take several months to a year or more to resume all activities without pain or strain to the back. People with certain occupations that involve heavy lifting or back strain may need to change job activities to avoid recurrent back injury."
3860,What are the symptoms of Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis?,"Symptoms of Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis include:
Abdominal pain and bloating Abdominal tenderness Fever Fluid in the abdomen Low urine output
Other symptoms include:
Chills Joint pain Nausea and vomiting"
3861,What causes Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis?,"Spontaneous peritonitis is usually caused by ascites, a collection of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. This usually occurs from liver or kidney failure. Risk factors for liver disease include alcoholic cirrhosis and other diseases that lead to cirrhosis, such as viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B or C). Spontaneous peritonitis also occurs in patients who are on dialysis for kidney failure."
3862,Who is at highest risk for Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ?,"Risk Factors include:
patients who have liver or kidney failure patients who are on dialysis for kidney failure patients with cirrhosis"
3863,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of peritonitis. This can quickly become an emergency situation.
3864,What to expect if I have Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The infection can usually be treated. However, kidney or liver disease may limit recovery.
Abscess Hepatic encephalopathy Hepatorenal syndrome Intestinal obstruction from scar tissue Sepsis"
3865,What are the symptoms of St. Louis encephalitis?,"Less than 1% of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) infections are clinically apparent and the vast majority of infections remain undiagnosed. The incubation period for SLEV disease (the time from infected mosquito bite to onset of illness) ranges from 5 to 15 days. Onset of illness is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, and malaise. Signs and symptoms intensify over a period of several days to a week. Some patients spontaneously recover after this period; others develop signs of central nervous system infections, including stiff neck, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, tremors and unsteadiness. Coma can develop in severe cases. The disease is generally milder in children than in older adults. About 40% of children and young adults with SLEV disease develop only fever and headache or aseptic meningitis; almost 90% of elderly persons with SLEV disease develop encephalitis. The overall case-fatality ratio is 5 to 15%. The risk of fatal disease also increases with age."
3866,What causes St. Louis encephalitis?,"St. Louis encephalitis is caused by St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). It is a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Other medically important flaviviruses found in the Americas include West Nile virus and Powassan virus. SLEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virus particles are spherical and have a diameter of 40 nm."
3867,Who is at highest risk for St. Louis encephalitis ?,"All residents of and visitors to areas where SLEV activity has been identified are at risk of SLEV infection, particularly persons who engage in outdoor work and recreational activities and those living in low-income areas. SLEV infection is thought to confer life-long immunity against re-infection with SLEV."
3868,What to expect if I have St. Louis encephalitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Mortality rate ranges from 5% to 30%, with higher rates among the elderly."
3869,What are the symptoms of stomach cancer?,"Early stomach cancer does not have any symptoms. When the cancer grows larger, people may notice one or more symptoms, such as the following:
Abdominal symptoms
Abdominal pain - At first the location may be in the upper or middle abdomen. It is typically a relatively mild pain. With the development of the cancer, abdominal pain may be persistent. Loss of appetite - Some patients endure a loss of appetite without any inducement. Nausea and vomiting - This is also because of the affect of the lump. It disturbs the normal digestive functions. Vomiting blood - Sometimes a massive hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal tract may occur. Vague abdominal fullness - This is because of the development of the lump. Premature abdominal fullness after meals: This is induced by the decreased amount of gastric space with the growth of the lump.
Abdominal lump - People can not find any lump at the beginning of the disease. When the cancer enlarges, the lump may be obvious in the abdomen.
Whole body symptoms
General decline in health- This is because of the consumption of the cancer. Weakness or fatigue - The reason is also because the cancer wastes your energy.
Infections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell his/her doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
Abdominal and whole body symptoms have no specificity. Other health problems may also cause similar symptoms. Go to see your doctor to verify your diseases as early as possible. Diseases with similar symptoms are listed in the following:
Acute or chronic gastritis Angina Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis Depression Gastric ulcer Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)"
3870,Who is at highest risk for Stomach cancer ?,"Adenocarcinoma of the stomach is a common cancer of the digestive tract worldwide, although it is uncommon in the United States. It occurs most often in men over age 40. This form of gastric cancer is very common in Japan, Chile, and Iceland.
The rate of most types of gastric adenocarcinoma in the United States has gone down over the years. Experts think the decrease may be because people are eating less salted, cured, and smoked foods.
Studies have found a number of factors that may increase the risk of stomach cancer. In recent years, scientists point out that Helicobacter pylori infection is the main cause of stomach cancer. HP infection and other risk factors may act together to increase the risk even more.
Have had a Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection Have gastric inflammation Male Eat lots of smoked, salted, or pickled food Smoke cigarettes Have a family history of stomach cancer"
3871,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stomach cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of gastric cancer develop. If you have the following symptoms, seek urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain - The reason a person with stomach cancer appears to have severe abdominal pain is mostly because of gastric wall perforation. This is the result of cancer invading and perforating the gastric wall. Surgical intervention needs to be done urgently. Vomiting a lot of blood- This is the result of the cancer invading the vessels of the gastric wall. An abundant amount of blood loss may lead to shock and death."
3872,What to expect if I have Stomach cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis varies widely. It depends on:
The area in which the lump is located The depth to which the mass invades the stomach wall With or without distant metastases"
3873,What are the symptoms of Strep throat?,"Symptoms of Strep throat can be very mild or severe. Symptoms usually develop 2 to 5 days after being exposed to the bacteria. Symptoms tend occur suddenly, and usually include some of the following:
Sudden fever Red throat, sometimes having white patches Sore throat Headache Stomach ache Nausea Chills General discomfort, malaise Loss of appetite, abnormal taste Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Trouble swallowing Scarlet fever-like rash. This occurs in only some strains of the bacteria."
3874,Who is at highest risk for Strep throat ?,"Strep throat is spread by person-to-person contact of nasal secretions or saliva. As a result, strep throat is most prominent during flu season, around the winter. People with strep are contagious for 24-48 hours after starting antibiotics, and should not go to school or work.
To prevent spreading the illness to others, anyone with strep should practice good hand washing, especially if preparing food for others. One should also get a toothbrush, and start using it after no longer being contagious but before finishing antibiotics. Bacteria can stay on the toothbrush and pose a risk of reinfection."
3875,What are the symptoms of Streptococcus pneumoniae?,"The most common symptoms of pneumonia are:
Cough (with some pneumonias you may cough up greenish or yellow mucus, or even bloody mucus) Fever, which may be mild or high Shaking chills Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs)
Other symptoms include:
Confusion, especially in older people Excess sweating and clammy skin Headache Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough"
3876,What causes Streptococcus pneumoniae?,"Pneumonia is a common illness that affects millions of people each year in the United States. Germs called bacteria, viruses, and fungi may cause pneumonia. Ways you can get pneumonia include:
Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to your lungs. You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs. You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or fluids from the mouth into your lungs (aspiration pneumonia).
Pneumonia caused by bacteria tends to be the most serious kind. In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.
The most common pneumonia -causing germ in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Atypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is sometimes seen in people whose immune system is not working well.
Many other bacteria can also cause pneumonia. Viruses are also a common cause of pneumonia, especially in infants and young children. See also: Respiratory syncytial virus"
3877,Who is at highest risk for Streptococcus pneumoniae infection ?,"Risk factors (conditions that increase your chances of getting pneumonia) include:
Cerebral palsy Chronic lung disease (COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis) Cigarette smoking Difficulty swallowing (due to stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, or other neurological conditions) Immune system problem (See also: Pneumonia in immunocompromised host) Impaired consciousness (loss of brain function due to dementia, stroke, or other neurologic conditions) Living in a nursing facility Other serious illnesses, such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus Recent surgery or trauma Recent cold, laryngitis, or flu"
3878,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Streptococcus pneumoniae infection ?,In case you feel you are developing symptoms of Pneumonia contact your doctor.
3879,What to expect if I have Streptococcus pneumoniae infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, most patients will improve within 2 weeks. Elderly or very sick patients may need longer treatment. Those who may be more likely to have complicated pneumonia include:
Older adults or very young children People whose immune system does not work well People with other, serious medical problems such as diabetes or cirrhosis of the liver
Your doctor may want to make sure your chest x-ray becomes normal again after you take a course of antibiotics. However, it may take many weeks for your x-ray to clear up."
3880,What causes Stupor?,"Many conditions can cause decreased alertness, including:
Chronic kidney disease Extreme tiredness or lack of sleep High blood sugar or low blood sugar Infection that is severe or involves the brain Liver failure Thyroid conditions that cause low thyroid hormone levels or very high thyroid hormone levels
Brain disorders or injury, such as:
Dementia or Alzheimer's disease Head trauma Seizure Stroke
Injury or accidents, such as:
Diving accidents and near drowning Heat stroke Very low body temperature (hypothermia)
Heart or breathing problems, such as:
Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) Lack of oxygen (hypoxia) from any cause Low blood pressure (hypotension) Low sodium levels in the blood Severe heart failure Severe lung diseases Very high blood pressure
Toxins and drugs, such as:
Alcohol abuse (binge drinking or damage from long-term alcohol use) Exposure to heavy metals, hydrocarbons, or toxic gases Overuse of drugs such as opiates, narcotics, sedatives, and anti-anxiety or seizure medications Side effect of almost any medicine, such as those used to treat seizures, depression, psychosis, and other illnesses."
3881,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stupor ?,Get medical help if someone has decreased alertness that cannot be explained. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if normal alertness does not return quickly.
3882,What are the symptoms of Stuttering?,"Stuttering may start with repeating consonants (k, g, t). If stuttering becomes worse, words and phrases are repeated.
Later, vocal spasms develop. There is a forced, almost explosive sound to speech. The person may appear to be struggling to speak.
Stressful social situations and anxiety can make symptoms worse.
Symptoms of stuttering may include:
Feeling frustrated when trying to communicate Pausing or hesitating when starting or during sentences, phrases, or words, often with the lips together Putting in (interjecting) extra sounds or words (We went to the...uh...store) Repeating sounds, words, parts of words, or phrases (I want...I want my doll, I...I see you, or Ca-ca-ca-can) Tension in the voice Very long sounds within words (I am Booooobbbby Jones or Llllllllike)
Other symptoms that might be seen with stuttering include:
Eye blinking Jerking of the head or other body parts Jaw jerking
Children with mild stuttering are often unaware of their stuttering. In more severe cases, children may be more aware. Facial movements, anxiety, and increased stuttering may occur when they are asked to speak.
Some people who stutter find that they don't stutter when they read aloud or sing."
3883,What causes Stuttering?,"About 5% of children (1 out of every 20 children) aged 2 - 5 will develop some stuttering during their childhood. It may last for several weeks to several years.
For a small number of children (less than 1%), stuttering does not go away and it may get worse. This is called developmental stuttering, and it is the most common type of stuttering.
Stuttering tends to run in families. Genes that cause stuttering have been identified.
There is also evidence that stuttering may be a result of some brain injuries, such as stroke or traumatic brain injuries.
Stuttering may rarely be caused by emotional trauma (called psychogenic stuttering).
Stuttering is more common in boys than girls. It also tends to persist into adulthood more often in boys than in girls."
3884,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stuttering ?,"Call your provider if:
Stuttering is interfering with your child's school work or emotional development The child seems anxious or embarrassed about speaking The symptoms last for more than 3 - 6 months"
3885,What to expect if I have Stuttering  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In most children who stutter, the phase passes and speech returns to normal within 3 or 4 years.
Stuttering that begins after a child is 8 - 10 years old is more likely to last into adulthood."
3886,What are the symptoms of Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis?,"Bizarre behavior Dementia (loss of cognitive (thought), emotional, and social abilities) Coma Gradual behavioral changes Myoclonic jerking (quick muscle jerking or spasms) School problems Seizures Unsteady gait Very tense muscles or muscles that lack tone, with weakness in both legs"
3887,What causes Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis?,"Ordinarily, the measles virus does not cause brain damage, but an abnormal immune response to measles or, possibly, certain mutant forms of the virus may cause severe illness and death. This leads to brain inflammation (swelling and irritation) that may last for years.
SSPE has been reported in all parts of the world, but in western countries it is considered a rare disease.
Fewer than 10 cases per year are reported in the United States, a dramatic decrease that followed the nationwide measles immunization program. However, in some countries like India, over 20 cases of SSPE per million people are reported each year."
3888,Who is at highest risk for Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ?,"SSPE tends to occur several years after an individual has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females, and the disease generally occurs in children and adolescents"
3889,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ?,Call your health care provider if your child has not completed their scheduled vaccines. The measles vaccine is included in the MMR vaccine.
3890,What to expect if I have Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Persons with this disease frequently die 1 to 2 years after diagnosis, but some may survive for longer periods. The condition is always deadly."
3891,What are the symptoms of Subarachnoid hemorrhage?,Severe headache: Headache is the main symptom. It often starts suddenly and starts after a popping or snapping feeling in the head. Speech disturbance Weakness on one side of the body Numbness Neck pain Double vision Nausea and vomiting Sudden or decreased consciousness Personality changes such as confusion and irritability
3892,Who is at highest risk for Subarachnoid hemorrhage ?,Cerebral arteriovenous malformation Cerebral aneurysm Head injury Polycystic kidney disease Hypertension Smoking Idiopathic
3893,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Subarachnoid hemorrhage ?,Go to emergency department or call 911 as soon as possible when you feel severe headache.
3894,What to expect if I have Subarachnoid hemorrhage  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage depends on:
The location and extent of the bleeding Whether the patient is accompanied with any complications, such as stroke and seizures. Severity of symptoms from the beginning The patient's general condition"
3895,What are the symptoms of Subdural hematoma?,"In adults:
Confused speech Difficulty with balance or walking Headache Lethargy or confusion Loss of consciousness Nausea and vomiting Numbness Seizures Slurred speech Visual disturbances Weakness
In infants:
Bulging fontanelles (the ""soft spots"" of the baby's skull) Feeding difficulties Focal seizures Generalized tonic-clonic seizure High-pitched cry Increased head circumference Increased sleepiness or lethargy Irritability Persistent vomiting Separated sutures (the areas where growing skull bones join)"
3896,What causes Subdural hematoma?,"Subdural hematomas are usually the result of a serious head injury. When one occurs in this way, it is called an acute subdural hematoma. Acute subdural hematomas are among the deadliest of all head injuries. The bleeding fills the brain area very rapidly, compressing brain tissue. This often results in brain injury and may lead to death.
Subdural hematomas can also occur after a very minor head injury, especially in the elderly. These may go unnoticed for many days to weeks, and are called chronic subdural hematomas. With any subdural hematoma, tiny veins between the surface of the brain and its outer covering (the dura) stretch and tear, allowing blood to collect. In the elderly, the veins are often already stretched because of brain atrophy (shrinkage) and are more easily injured.
Some subdural hematomas occur without cause (spontaneously)."
3897,Who is at highest risk for Subdural hematoma ?,"The following increase your risk for a subdural hematoma:
Anticoagulant medication (blood thinners, including aspirin) Long-term abuse of alcohol Recurrent falls Repeated head injury Very young or very old age"
3898,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Subdural hematoma ?,"A subdural hematoma requires emergency medical attention. Call 911 or your local emergency number, or go immediately to an emergency room after a head injury.
Spinal injuries often occur with head injuries, so try to keep the person's neck still if you must move him or her before help arrives."
3899,What to expect if I have Subdural hematoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook following a subdural hematoma varies widely depending on the type and location of head injury, the size of the blood collection, and how quickly treatment is obtained.
Acute subdural hematomas present the greatest challenge, with high rates of death and injury. Subacute and chronic subdural hematomas have better outcomes in most cases, with symptoms often going away after the blood collection is drained. A period of rehabilitation is sometimes needed to assist the person back to his or her usual level of functioning.
There is a high frequency of seizures following a subdural hematoma, even after drainage, but these are usually well controlled with medication. Seizures may occur at the time the hematoma forms, or up to months or years afterward."
3900,Can humans catch swine flu?,"Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with swine flu have occurred. Most commonly, these cases occur in persons with direct exposure to pigs (e.g. children near pigs at a fair or workers in the swine industry). In addition, there have been documented cases of one person spreading swine flu to others. For example, an outbreak of apparent swine flu infection in pigs in Wisconsin in 1988 resulted in multiple human infections, and, although no community outbreak resulted, there was antibody evidence of virus transmission from the patient to health care workers who had close contact with the patient."
3901,How common is swine flu infection in humans?,"In the past, CDC received reports of approximately one human swine influenza virus infection every one to two years in the U.S., but from December 2005 through February 2009, 12 cases of human infection with swine influenza have been reported."
3902,What are the symptoms of swine flu in humans?,"The symptoms of swine flu in people are expected to be similar to the symptoms of regular human seasonal influenza and include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing. Some people with swine flu also have reported runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."
3903,Can people catch swine flu from eating pork?,No. Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is safe. Cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160°F kills the swine flu virus as it does other bacteria and viruses.
3904,How does swine flu spread?,"Influenza viruses can be directly transmitted from pigs to people and from people to pigs. Human infection with flu viruses from pigs are most likely to occur when people are in close proximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits housing pigs at fairs. Human-to-human transmission of swine flu can also occur. This is thought to occur in the same way as seasonal flu occurs in people, which is mainly person-to-person transmission through coughing or sneezing of people infected with the influenza virus. People may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose."
3905,What do we know about human-to-human spread of swine flu?,"In September 1988, a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman was hospitalized for pneumonia and died 8 days later. A swine H1N1 flu virus was detected. Four days before getting sick, the patient visited a county fair swine exhibition where there was widespread influenza-like illness among the swine.
In follow-up studies, 76% of swine exhibitors tested had antibody evidence of swine flu infection but no serious illnesses were detected among this group. Additional studies suggest that one to three health care personnel who had contact with the patient developed mild influenza-like illnesses with antibody evidence of swine flu infection."
3906,How can human infections with swine influenza be diagnosed?,"To diagnose swine influenza A infection, a respiratory specimen would generally need to be collected within the first 4 to 5 days of illness (when an infected person is most likely to be shedding virus). However, some persons, especially children, may shed virus for 10 days or longer. Identification as a swine flu influenza A virus requires sending the specimen to CDC for laboratory testing."
3907,What medications are available to treat swine flu infections in humans?,"There are four different antiviral drugs that are licensed for use in the US for the treatment of influenza: amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir. While most swine influenza viruses have been susceptible to all four drugs, the most recent swine influenza viruses isolated from humans are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. At this time, CDC recommends the use of oseltamivir or zanamivir for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses."
3908,What other examples of swine flu outbreaks are there?,"Probably the most well known is an outbreak of swine flu among soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey in 1976. The virus caused disease with x-ray evidence of pneumonia in at least 4 soldiers and 1 death; all of these patients had previously been healthy. The virus was transmitted to close contacts in a basic training environment, with limited transmission outside the basic training group. The virus is thought to have circulated for a month and disappeared. The source of the virus, the exact time of its introduction into Fort Dix, and factors limiting its spread and duration are unknown. The Fort Dix outbreak may have been caused by introduction of an animal virus into a stressed human population in close contact in crowded facilities during the winter. The swine influenza A virus collected from a Fort Dix soldier was named A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1)."
3909,Is the H1N1 swine flu virus the same as human H1N1 viruses?,"No. The H1N1 swine flu viruses are antigenically very different from human H1N1 viruses and, therefore, vaccines for human seasonal flu would not provide protection from H1N1 swine flu viruses."
3910,What are the symptoms of Syphilis?,"Primary syphilis symptoms include:
Chancre -- a small, painless open sore or ulcer on the genitals, mouth, skin, or rectum that heals by itself in 3 - 6 weeks Enlarged lymph nodes in the area containing the chancre
The bacteria continue to multiply in the body, but there are few symptoms until the second stage.
Secondary syphilis symptoms include:
A skin rash (the most common symptom), which often involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Sores called mucous patches may develop in or around the mouth, vagina, or penis. Moist, warty patches may develop in the genitals or skin folds. These are called condylomata lata. Other symptoms, such as fever, general ill feeling, loss of appetite, muscle aches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, vision changes, and hair loss may occur.
Symptoms of tertiary syphilis depend on which organs have been affected. They vary widely and are difficult to diagnose. Symptoms of tertiary syphilis include:
Cardiovascular syphilis, which affects the aorta of the heart and causes aneurysms or valve disease Central nervous system disorders (neurosyphilis) Tumors of skin, bones, or liver (gumma)"
3911,What causes Syphilis?,"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted, infectious disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.
Syphilis occurs worldwide. Syphilis is more common in urban areas, and the number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 - 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.
Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).
Syphilis has three stages:
Primary syphilis Secondary syphilis Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness)
Secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States as they were in the past because of the availability of:
Free, government-sponsored sexually transmitted disease clinics Screening tests for syphilis Public education about STDs Prenatal screening"
3912,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Syphilis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of syphilis.
If you have had intimate contact with a person who has syphilis or any other STD, or have engaged in any high-risk sexual practices, including having multiple or unknown partners or using intravenous drugs, contact your doctor or get screened in an STD clinic."
3913,What to expect if I have Syphilis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Syphilis can be cured if it is diagnosed early and completely treated.
Secondary syphilis can be cured if it is diagnosed early and treated effectively. Although it usually goes away within weeks, in some cases it may last for up to 1 year. Without treatment, up to one-third of patients will have late complications of syphilis.
Late syphilis may be permanently disabling, and it may lead to death."
3914,What are the symptoms of Taenia infection?,"Taenia infection usually does not cause any symptoms. However, some people may have abdominal discomfort.
People often realize they are infected when they pass segments of the worm in their stool, especially if the segments are moving."
3915,What causes Taenia infection?,"Taenia infection is caused by eating the raw or undercooked meat of infected animals. Cattle usually carry Taenia saginata (T. saginata). Pigs carry Taenia solium (T. solium).
In the human intestine, the young form of the tapeworm from the infected meat (larva) develops into the adult tapeworm. A tapeworm can grow to longer than 12 feet and can live for years.
Tapeworms have many segments. Each segment is able to produce eggs. Eggs are spread alone or in groups, and can pass out with the stool or through the anus.
Adults and children with pork tapeworm can infect themselves if they have poor hygiene. They can ingest tapeworm eggs they pick up on their hands while wiping or scratching their anus or the skin around it.
Those who are infected can expose other people to T. solium eggs, usually through food handling."
3916,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Taenia infection ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you pass something in your stool that looks like a white worm.
3917,What to expect if I have Taenia infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, the tapeworm infection goes away."
3918,What are the symptoms of Adolescent pregnancy?,"Pregnancy symptoms include:
Abdominal distention Breast enlargement and breast tenderness Fatigue Light-headedness or actual fainting Missed period Nausea or vomiting Frequent urination"
3919,What causes Adolescent pregnancy?,"The rate of adolescent pregnancy and the birth rate for adolescents have generally declined since reaching an all-time high in 1990, mostly due to the increased use of condoms.
Adolescent pregnancy is a complex issue with many reasons for concern.
Younger adolescents (12 - 14 years old) are more likely to have unplanned sexual intercourse and more likely to be coerced into sex. Adolescents 18 - 19 years old are technically adults, and half of adolescent pregnancies occur in this age group."
3920,Who is at highest risk for Teenage pregnancy ?,"Risk factors for adolescent pregnancy include:
Younger age Poor school performance Economic disadvantage Single or teen parents"
3921,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Teenage pregnancy ?,"Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy.
Your health care provider can also provide counseling regarding birth control methods, sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention, or pregnancy risk."
3922,What to expect if I have Teenage pregnancy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Having her first child during adolescence makes a woman more likely to have more children overall. Teen mothers are about 2 years behind their age group in completing their education. Women who have a baby during their teen years are more likely to live in poverty.
Teen mothers with a history of substance abuse are more likely to start abusing by about 6 months after delivery.
Teen mothers are more likely than older mothers to have a second child within 2 years of their first child.
Infants born to teenage mothers are at greater risk for developmental problems. Girls born to teen mothers are more likely to become teen mothers themselves, and boys born to teen mothers have a higher than average rate of being arrested and jailed."
3923,What are the symptoms of temporal arteritis?,"Excessive sweating Fever General ill feeling Jaw pain that comes and goes or occurs when chewing Loss of appetite Muscle aches Pain and stiffness in the neck, upper arms, shoulder, and hips Throbbing headache on one side of the head or the back of the head Scalp sensitivity, tenderness when touching the scalp Vision difficulties Blurred vision Double vision Reduced vision (blindness in one or both eyes) Weakness, excessive tiredness Weight loss (more than 5% of total body weight)
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Bleeding gums Face pain Hearing loss Joint stiffness Joint pain Mouth sores
About 40% of people will have other, nonspecific symptoms such as respiratory complaints (most frequently dry cough) or weakness or pain along many nerve areas. Rarely, paralysis of eye muscles may occur. A persistent fever may be the only symptom."
3924,What causes temporal arteritis?,"Temporal, giant cell, and cranial arteritis occur when one or more arteries become inflamed, swollen, and tender.
Temporal arteritis most commonly occurs in the head, especially in the temporal arteries that branch off from a blood vessel in the neck called the carotid artery. However, the condition can affect almost any medium-to-large artery anywhere in the body.
The cause is unknown, but is believed to be partly due to a faulty immune response. The disorder has been associated with severe infections and the use of high doses of antibiotics.
The disorder may develop along with or after polymyalgia rheumatica. Giant cell arteritis is almost always seen in people over age 50, but it may sometimes occur in younger people. It is rare in people of African descent. There is some evidence that it runs in families."
3925,Who is at highest risk for Temporal arteritis ?,Patients with followings are at increased risk of temporal arteritis: Age > 50 years Hypertension Thrombocytosis Female
3926,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Temporal arteritis ?,Call your health care provider if you have a persistent throbbing headache and other symptoms of temporal arteritis.
3927,What to expect if I have Temporal arteritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most people make a full recovery, but long-term treatment (for 1 to 2 years or longer) may be needed. The condition may return at a later date."
3928,What are the symptoms of Tension headache?,"The headache pain may be described as:
Dull, pressure-like (not throbbing) A tight band or vise on the head All over (not just in one point or one side) Worse in the scalp, temples, or back of the neck, and possibly in the shoulders
The pain may occur as an isolated event, constantly, or daily. Pain may last for 30 minutes to 7 days. It may be triggered by or get worse with stress, fatigue, noise, or glare.
There may be difficulty sleeping. Tension headaches usually do not cause nausea or vomiting.
People with tension headaches tend to try to relieve pain by massaging their scalp, temples, or the bottom of the neck."
3929,What causes Tension headache?,"Tension headaches are one of the most common forms of headaches. They may occur at any age, but are most common in adults and adolescents.
If a headache occurs two or more times a week for several months or longer, the condition is considered chronic. Chronic daily headaches can result from the under- or over-treatment of a primary headache.
Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They may occur if you overuse painkillers.
Tension headaches occur when neck and scalp muscles become tense, or contract. The muscle contractions can be a response to stress, depression, a head injury, or anxiety.
Any activity that causes the head to be held in one position for a long time without moving can cause a headache. Such activities include typing or other computer work, fine work with the hands, and using a microscope. Sleeping in a cold room or sleeping with the neck in an abnormal position may also trigger a tension headache.
Other triggers of tension headaches include:
Alcohol use Caffeine (too much or withdrawal) Colds, the flu, or a sinus infection Dental problems such as jaw clenching or teeth grinding Eye strain Excessive smoking Fatigue or overexertion
Tension headaches can occur when you also have a migraine. Tension headaches are not associated with brain diseases."
3930,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tension headache ?,"Call 911 if:
You are experiencing ""the worst headache of your life."" You have speech, vision, or movement problems or loss of balance, especially if you have not had these symptoms with a headache before. The headache starts very suddenly. The headache occurs with repeated vomiting. You have a high fever.
Also, call your doctor if:
Your headache patterns or pain change. Treatments that once worked are no longer helpful. You have side effects from medication, including irregular heartbeat, pale or blue skin, extreme sleepiness, persistent cough, depression, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, cramps, dry mouth, or extreme thirst. You are pregnant or could become pregnant -- some medications should not be taken when pregnant."
3931,What to expect if I have Tension headache  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Tension headaches often respond well to treatment, and do not cause serious medical problems. However, chronic tension headaches can have a negative impact on the quality of life and work."
3932,What are the symptoms of Teratoma?,"Signs and symptoms vary depending on the location. Early teratoma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Chest pain Cough Shortness of breath Abdominal pain Lump Abnormal bleeding from the vagina Fatigue, weight loss Limited ability to tolerate exercise
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
3933,What causes Teratoma?,"It is often located in the chest area. Most malignant teratomas can spread throughout the body, and have spread by the time of diagnosis.
A number of other cancers are often associated with these tumors, including:
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma Malignant histiocytosis Myelodysplasia (MDS) Small cell undifferentiated carcinoma"
3934,Who is at highest risk for Teratoma ?,Teratoma occurs most often in young men in their 20s - 30s
3935,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Teratoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of teratoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Shortness of breath Severe abdominal pain A large amount of bleeding from the vagina"
3936,What to expect if I have Teratoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of teratoma depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The size and location of the tumor The patient’s general health"
3937,What are the symptoms of testicular cancer?,"Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves. Also, doctors generally examine the testicles during routine physical exams. Between regular checkups, if a man notices anything unusual about his testicles, he should talk with his doctor. Men should see a doctor if they notice any of the following symptoms:
A painless lump or swelling in a testicle Pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum Any enlargement of a testicle or change in the way it feels A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum A dull ache in the lower abdomen, back, or groin A sudden collection of fluid in the scrotum
These symptoms can be caused by cancer or by other conditions. It is important to see a doctor to determine the cause of any of these symptoms."
3938,What are the causes of testicular cancer?,"The exact causes of testicular cancer are not known. However, studies have shown that several factors increase a man's chance of developing this disease."
3939,Who is at highest risk for Testicular cancer ?,"Testicular cancer accounts for only 1 percent of all cancers in men in the United States. About 8,000 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer, and about 390 men die of this disease each year. Testicular cancer occurs most often in men between the ages of 20 and 39, and is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 34. It is most common in white men, especially those of Scandinavian descent. The testicular cancer rate has more than doubled among white men in the past 40 years, but has only recently begun to increase among black men. The reason for the racial differences in incidence is not known.
The exact causes of testicular cancer are not known. However, studies have shown that several factors increase a man's chance of developing this disease.
Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism): Normally, the testicles descend from inside the abdomen into the scrotum before birth. The risk of testicular cancer is increased in males with a testicle that does not move down into the scrotum. This risk does not change even after surgery to move the testicle into the scrotum. The increased risk applies to both testicles. Congenital abnormalities: Men born with abnormalities of the testicles, penis, or kidneys, as well as those with inguinal hernia (hernia in the groin area, where the thigh meets the abdomen), may be at increased risk. History of testicular cancer: Men who have had testicular cancer are at increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle. Family history of testicular cancer: The risk for testicular cancer is greater in men whose brother or father has had the disease."
3940,What to expect if I have Testicular cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Regular follow-up exams are extremely important for men who have been treated for testicular cancer. Like all cancers, testicular cancer can recur (come back). Men who have had testicular cancer should see their doctor regularly and should report any unusual symptoms right away. Follow-up varies for different types and stages of testicular cancer. Generally, patients are checked frequently by their doctor and have regular blood tests to measure tumor marker levels. They also have regular x-rays and computed tomography, also called CT scans or CAT scans (detailed pictures of areas inside the body created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine). Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased likelihood of developing cancer in the remaining testicle. Patients treated with chemotherapy may have an increased risk of certain types of leukemia, as well as other types of cancer. Regular follow-up care ensures that changes in health are discussed and that problems are treated as soon as possible.
Men with testicular cancer should discuss their concerns about sexual function and fertility with their doctor. It is important to know that men with testicular cancer often have fertility problems even before their cancer is treated. If a man has pre-existing fertility problems, or if he is to have treatment that might lead to infertility, he may want to ask the doctor about sperm banking (freezing sperm before treatment for use in the future). This procedure allows some men to have children even if the treatment causes loss of fertility."
3941,What are the symptoms of Testicular torsion?,"Sudden onset of severe pain in one testicle, with or without a previous predisposing event Swelling within one side of the scrotum (scrotal swelling) Nausea or vomiting Light-headedness
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease:
Testicle lump Blood in the semen"
3942,What causes Testicular torsion?,"Some men may be predisposed to testicular torsion as a result of inadequate connective tissue within the scrotum. However, the condition can result from trauma to the scrotum, particularly if significant swelling occurs. It may also occur after strenuous exercise or may not have an obvious cause."
3943,Who is at highest risk for Testicular torsion ?,The condition is more common during infancy (first year of life) and at the beginning of adolescence (puberty).
3944,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Testicular torsion ?,Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if testicular torsion symptoms occur
3945,What to expect if I have Testicular torsion  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If the condition is diagnosed quickly and immediately corrected, the testicle may continue to function properly. After 6 hours of torsion (impaired blood flow), the likelihood that the testicle will need to be removed increases. However, even with less than 6 hours of torsion, the testicle may lose its ability to function."
3946,What are the symptoms of Tetanus?,"The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to ""locking"" of the jaw, which makes it impossible to open your mouth or swallow. If this happens, you could die of suffocation.
Trismus, or lockjaw Facial spasms called risus sardonicus Stiffness of the neck Difficulty in swallowing Rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles. Elevated temperature Sweating Elevated blood pressure Episodic rapid heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos. Spasms continue for up to 4 weeks, and complete recovery may take months. Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns."
3947,What causes Tetanus?,"Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails, but this concept is somewhat misleading. Objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors, or in places that harbor anaerobic bacteria, but the rust itself does not cause tetanus nor does it contain more C. tetani bacteria. The rough surface of rusty metal merely provides a prime habitat for a C. tetani endospore to reside, and the nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospore into the wound. An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Because C. tetani is an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores survive well in an environment that lacks oxygen. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment is provided by the same object which causes a puncture wound, delivering endospores to a suitable environment for growth."
3948,Who is at highest risk for Tetanus ?,People in developing countries are more at risk because of lack of vaccination.
3949,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tetanus ?,The wound should be taken care of as soon as possible.
3950,What to expect if I have Tetanus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If you get tetanus, there is usually a long course of treatment. The tetanus vaccine can prevent tetanus but its protection does not last forever. Adults should get a tetanus shot, or booster, every 10 years. If you get a bad cut or burn, see your doctor--you may need a booster."
3951,What are the symptoms of Thalassemia?,"The most severe form of alpha thalassemia major causes stillbirth (death of the unborn baby during birth or the late stages of pregnancy).
Children born with thalessemia major (Cooley's anemia) are normal at birth, but develop severe anemia during the first year of life.
Other symptoms can include:
Bone deformities in the face Fatigue Growth failure Shortness of breath Yellow skin (jaundice)
Persons with the minor form of alpha and beta thalassemia have small red blood cells (which are identified by looking at their red blood cells under a microscope), but no symptoms."
3952,What causes Thalassemia?,"Hemoglobin is made of two proteins: Alpha globin and beta globin. Thalassemia occurs when there is a defect in a gene that helps control production of one of these proteins.
There are two main types of thalassemia:
Alpha thalassemia occurs when a gene or genes related to the alpha globin protein are missing or changed (mutated). Alpha thalassemias occur most commonly in persons from southeast Asia, the Middle East, China, and in those of African descent.
Beta thalassemia occurs when similar gene defects affect production of the beta globin protein. Beta thalassemias occur in persons of Mediterranean origin, and to a lesser extent, Chinese, other Asians, and African Americans.
There are many forms of thalassemia. Each type has many different subtypes. Both alpha and beta thalassemia include the following two forms:
Thalassemia major Beta thalassemia major is also called Cooley's anemia. Thalassemia minor: You must inherit the defective gene from both parents to develop thalassemia major. Thalassemia minor occurs if you receive the defective gene from only one parent. Persons with this form of the disorder are carriers of the disease and usually do not have symptoms."
3953,Who is at highest risk for Thalassemia ?,"Asian, Chinese, Mediterranean, or African American ethnicity Family history of the disorder"
3954,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thalassemia ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You or your child has symptoms of thalassemia You are being treated for the disorder and new symptoms develop"
3955,What to expect if I have Thalassemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Severe thalassemia can cause early death due to heart failure, usually between ages 20 and 30. Frequent blood transfusions with therapy to remove iron from the body helps improve the outcome.
Less severe forms of thalassemia usually do not result in a shorter life span."
3956,What are the symptoms of Thrombocytopenia?,"You may not have any symptoms. Or you may have general symptoms, such as:
Bleeding in the mouth and gums Bruising Nosebleeds Rash (pinpoint red spots called petechia)
Other symptoms depend on the cause."
3957,What causes Thrombocytopenia?,"Thrombocytopenia is often divided into three major causes of low platelets:
Not enough platelets are made in the bone marrow Increased breakdown of platelets in the bloodstream Increased breakdown of platelets in the spleen or liver
Your bone marrow may not make enough platelets if you have any of the following conditions:
Aplastic anemia Cancer in the bone marrow, such as leukemia Cirrhosis (liver scarring) Folate deficiency Infections in the bone marrow (very rare) Myelodysplastic syndrome (bone marrow does not make enough blood cells or makes defective cells) Vitamin B12 deficiency
Use of certain drugs may also lead to a low production of platelets in the bone marrow. The most common example is chemotherapy treatment.
The following health conditions cause increased breakdown of platelets:
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Drug-induced nonimmune thrombocytopenia Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia Hypersplenism (swollen spleen) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura"
3958,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thrombocytopenia ?,Call your healthcare provider if you experience unexplained bleeding or bruising.
3959,What to expect if I have Thrombocytopenia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on the disorder causing the low platelet counts.
3960,What are the symptoms of Thrombophlebitis?,"The following symptoms are often associated with thrombophlebitis:
Inflammation (swelling) in the part of the body affected Pain in the part of the body affected Skin redness (not always present) Warmth and tenderness over the vein"
3961,What causes Thrombophlebitis?,"The following increase your chances for thrombophlebitis:
Being hospitalized for a major surgery or with a major illness Disorders that make you more likely to develop blood clots Sitting for a long period of time (such as on a long airplane trip)
There are two main types of thrombophlebitis:
Deep venous thrombosis (affects deeper, larger veins) Superficial thrombophlebitis (affects veins near the skin surface)"
3962,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thrombophlebitis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of thrombophlebitis.
Call your health care provider promptly if thrombophlebitis symptoms do not improve with treatment, if symptoms get worse, or if new symptoms occur (such as an entire limb becoming pale, cold, or swollen)."
3963,What to expect if I have Thrombophlebitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Thrombophlebitis and other forms of phlebitis usually respond to prompt medical treatment.
3964,What are the symptoms of thyroid adenoma?,"Common symptoms of thyroid adenoma includes the following: 
Swelling or pain infront of the neck Cough Shortness of breath Hoarseness of voice Warm sweaty skin Skin flushing Increased appetite Weight loss Restlessness Nervousness Heat intolerance Trembling hands Palpitations Insominia Anxiety Increased bowel frequency Menstrual irregularities"
3965,What causes thyroid adenoma?,"Common causes of thyroid adenoma include iodine deficiency, chronic inflammation, and genetic mutation of THADA gene."
3966,Who is at highest risk for Thyroid adenoma ?,People with positive family history of thyroid adenoma are at highest risk of thyroid adenoma.
3967,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thyroid adenoma ?,Seek urgent medical care if there are pressure symptoms of thyroid adenoma or its complications.
3968,What to expect if I have Thyroid adenoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Depending on the extent of the tumor at the time of diagnosis, the prognosis of thyroid adenoma may vary. However, the prognosis is generally regarded as excellent."
3969,What are the symptoms of thyroid cancer?,"While patients with early thyroid cancer do not present with any symptoms, as the tumor grows larger people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
A nodule, lump, or swelling in the neck, which may be perceptible by touch Pain in the throat/neck Vocal hoarseness Difficulty swallowing Swollen lymph nodes"
3970,What causes thyroid cancer?,"While the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown, certain genetic mutations are suspected to be associated with the disease. People who have had radiation therapy to the neck area, or as children are at higher risk for developing thyroid cancer. Radiation therapy was commonly used in the 1950's to treat skin disorders and enlarged thymus gland, adenoids, and tonsils."
3971,Who is at highest risk for Thyroid cancer ?,"Clinical data have suggested that the development of thyroid cancer is related to various factors, such as:
A diet low in iodine: thyroid cancers are more common in regions characterized by iodine-deficient diets. Radiation exposure Patients over the age of 45-years"
3972,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thyroid cancer ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of thyroid cancer develop.
3973,What to expect if I have Thyroid cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of thyroid cancer depends on the following:
The histological type The stage of cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the thyroid gland Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery Patient's age Size of the tumor"
3974,What are the symptoms of Tick-borne disease?,"Watch for the following symptoms of tick-borne disease in the weeks following a tick bite:
Rash Skin ulcer Fever / chills Headache Muscle or joint aches Weakness Swollen lymph nodes Flu-like symptoms Stiff neck
The symptoms below refer to the problems resulting from the bite itself, not the diseases that a bite may cause. Some of the symptoms may be specific of one kind of tick:
Rash Blisters Swelling at bite site Severe pain at bite site lasting for several weeks Weakness Difficulty breathing Uncoordinated movement"
3975,What causes Tick-borne disease?,"While most ticks do not carry diseases, some ticks may carry bacteria that can cause:
Lyme disease (most common tick disease in the US) Colorado tick fever Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tularemia"
3976,Who is at highest risk for Tick-borne disease ?,"People who spend time outdoors and/or have pets that go outdoors are at risk for tick-borne disease, particularly during the warm seasons."
3977,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tick-borne disease ?,If you have symptoms of Tick-borne disease contact health care professional. Long-term treatment may be needed if complications develop. Preventive antibiotics are often given to people who live in areas where Lyme disease is common.
3978,What are the symptoms of Oral cancer?,"Mucous membrane lesion, lump, or ulcer:
May be a deep, hard-edged crack in the tissue Most often pale colored, may be dark or discolored On the tongue, lip, or other mouth area Usually painless at first (may develop a burning sensation or pain when the tumor is advanced) Usually small
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease:
Abnormal taste in the mouth Mouth sores Swallowing difficulty Tongue problems"
3979,What causes Oral cancer?,"Oral cancer most commonly involves the tissue of the lips or the tongue. It may also occur on the floor of the mouth, cheek lining, gums (gingiva), or roof of the mouth (palate).
Most oral cancers look very similar under the microscope and are called squamous cell carcinomas. These are malignant and tend to spread rapidly.
Smoking and other tobacco use are associated with 70 - 80% of oral cancer cases. Smoke and heat from cigarettes, cigars, and pipes irritate the mucous membranes of the mouth. Use of chewing tobacco or snuff causes irritation from direct contact with the mucous membranes. Heavy alcohol use is another activity associated with increased risk for oral cancer.
Other factors that increase the risk of oral cancer include poor dental and oral hygiene and chronic irritation (such as from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings). Some oral cancers begin as a white plaque (leukoplakia) or as a mouth ulcer. Recently, infection with HPV (human papilloma virus) has beeen shown to be a risk factor.
Oral cancer accounts for about 8% of all malignant growths. Men get oral cancer twice as often as women do, particularly men older than 40."
3980,Who is at highest risk for Tongue cancer ?,Smokers People infected with HPV People who practice poor dental and oral hygiene
3981,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tongue cancer ?,"Oral cancer may be discovered when the dentist performs a routine cleaning and examination.
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have a lesion of the mouth or lip or a lump in the neck that does not go away within 1 month. Early diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer greatly increases the chances of survival."
3982,What to expect if I have Tongue cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Approximately half of people with oral cancer will live more than 5 years after diagnosis and treatment. If the cancer is detected early, before it has spread to other tissues, the cure rate is nearly 75%. Unfortunately, more than half of oral cancers are advanced at the time the cancer is detected. Most have spread to the throat or neck.
Approximately 25% of people with oral cancer die because of delayed diagnosis and treatment."
3983,What are the symptoms of Tonsilits?,"Difficulty swallowing
Ear pain
Fever, chills
Headache
Sore throat - lasts longer than 48 hours and may be severe
Tenderness of the jaw and throat"
3984,What causes Tonsilits?,A bacterial or viral infection can cause tonsillitis. Strep throat is a common cause. The infection may also be seen in other parts of the throat.
3985,Who is at highest risk for Tonsilitis ?,"Tonsillitis is very common, especially in children."
3986,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tonsilitis ?,"Call your health care provider if there is:
Excess drooling in a young child
Fever, especially 101°F or higher
Pus in the back of the throat
Red rash that feels rough, and increased redness in the skin folds
Severe difficulty swallowing or breathing
Tender or swollen lymph glands in the neck"
3987,What to expect if I have Tonsilitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Tonsillitis symptoms due to strep usually get better about 2 or 3 days after you start the antibiotics.
Children with strep throat should generally be kept home from school or day care until they have been on antibiotics for 24 hours. This helps reduce the spread of illness."
3988,What are the symptoms of Tonsillitis?,"Difficulty swallowing Ear pain Fever, chills Headache Sore throat - lasts longer than 48 hours and may be severe Tenderness of the jaw and throat Voice changes, loss of voice"
3989,What causes Tonsillitis?,"The tonsils are lymph nodes in the back of the mouth and top of the throat. They normally help to filter out bacteria and other microorganisms to prevent infection in the body.
They may become so overwhelmed by bacterial or viral infection that they swell and become inflamed, causing tonsillitis. The infection may also be present in the throat and surrounding areas, causing inflammation of the pharynx. The pharynx is in the back of the throat, between the tonsils and the voicebox (larynx).
Tonsillitis is extremely common, particularly in children."
3990,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tonsillitis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
A sore throat lasts longer than 48 hours New symptoms develop Symptoms get worse You have other symptoms with the sore throat"
3991,What to expect if I have Tonsillitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Tonsillitis symptoms usually improve 2 or 3 days after treatment starts. The infection usually is cured after treatment is completed, but some people may need more than one course of antibiotics.
Complications of untreated strep tonsillitis may be severe. Children with tonsillitis related to strep throat or pharyngitis should generally be kept home from school or day care until they have been on antibiotics for 24 hours. This helps reduce the spread of illness."
3992,What are the symptoms of Torticollis?,Limited range of motion of the head Headache Head tremor Neck pain Shoulder is higher on one side of the body Stiffness of neck muscles Swelling of the neck muscles (possibly present at birth)

Inherited: Due to specific changes in your genes Acquired: Develops as a result of damage to the nervous system or muscles
If the condition occurs without a known cause, it is called idiopathic torticollis.
Torticollis may develop in childhood or adulthood. Congenital torticollis (present at birth) may occur if the fetus' head is in the wrong position while growing in the womb, or if the muscles or blood supply to the fetus' neck are injured."
3994,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Torticollis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms develop.
Torticollis that occurs after an injury or with illness may be serious. Seek immediate medical help if this occurs."
3995,What to expect if I have Torticollis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The condition may be easier to correct in infants and children. If the condition becomes chronic, numbness and tingling may develop as nerve roots become compressed in the neck.
The muscle itself may become large (hypertrophic) due to constant stimulation and exercise.
Botulinum toxin injections often provide substantial relief."
3996,What are the symptoms of Tourette syndrome?,"Most people with Tourette syndrome first notice symptoms during childhood, between ages 7 and 10.
The most common first symptom is a tic of the face, but other tics may follow. A tic is a sudden, fast, repeated movement or sound.
Symptoms of Tourette syndrome can range from tiny, minor movements (such as grunts, sniffling, or coughing) to constant movements and sounds that can't be controlled.
Tics can include:
Arm thrusting Eye blinking Jumping Kicking Repeated throat clearing or sniffing Shoulder shrugging
Tics may occur many times a day, but they tend to improve or get worse at different times. The tics may change with time. Symptoms usually get worse before the mid-teen years.
Contrary to popular belief, only a small number of patients use curse words or other inappropriate words or phrases (coprolalia).
Tourette syndrome is different from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People with OCD feel as though they have to do the behaviors.
Many people with Tourette syndrome can stop doing the tic for periods of time. However, they find that the tic is stronger for a few minutes after they allow it to start again. Often the tic slows or stops during sleep."
3997,What causes Tourette syndrome?,"Tourette syndrome is named for Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885.
There is strong evidence that Tourette syndrome is passed down through families, although the gene has not yet been found.
The syndrome may be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain. It may have to do with chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells talk to one another.
Tourette syndrome can be either severe or mild. About 10% of Americans have a mild tic disorder. Far fewer people have more severe forms of Tourette syndrome. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help.
Tourette syndrome is four times as likely to occur in boys as in girls."
3998,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tourette syndrome ?,"Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have tics that are severe or persistent, or if they interfere with your daily life."
3999,What to expect if I have Tourette syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Symptoms usually peak during the teenage years and then improve in early adulthood.
Although 1 in 4 patients may be symptom-free for a few years, only 8% of symptoms go away without returning.
Patients usually have normal intelligence and live a normal-length life."
4000,What are the symptoms of Toxic megacolon?,"The rapid widening of the colon may cause the following symptoms:
Abdominal pain Abdominal distention Abdominal tenderness Dehydration Fever Rapid heart rate Shock"
4001,What are the causes of Toxic megacolon?,"Toxic megacolon occurs as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, and infections of the colon. The term ""toxic"" means that this complication occurs with infection or inflammation.
This is not the same as other forms of megacolon, such as pseudo-obstruction, acute colonic ileus, or congenital colonic dilation. These conditions occur without infection or inflammation."
4002,Who is at highest risk for Toxic megacolon ?,Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Crohn's disease Hirschsprung's disease Intestinal infection Laxative abuse Peripheral vascular disease Ulcerative colitis
4003,What are the symptoms of Toxic shock syndrome?,"Confusion Diarrhea General ill-feeling Headaches High fever, sometimes accompanied by chills Low blood pressure Muscle aches Nausea and vomiting Organ failure (usually kidneys and liver) Redness of eyes, mouth, throat Seizures Widespread red rash that looks like a sunburn -- skin peeling occurs 1 or 2 weeks after the rash, particularly on the palms of the hand or bottom of the feet"
4004,Who is at highest risk for Toxic shock syndrome ?,"Risk factors include:
Childbirth Current Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection Foreign bodies or packings (such as those used to stop nosebleeds) Menstruation Surgery Tampon use (particularly if you leave on in for a long time) Use of barrier contraceptives such as a diaphragm or vaginal sponge"
4005,What to expect if I have Toxic shock syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Toxic shock syndrome may be deadly in up to 50% of cases. The condition may return in those that survive.
4006,What are the symptoms of Toxoplasmosis?,"Most primary infections produce no symptoms. The time between exposure to the parasite and symptom development is 1 - 2 weeks. The disease can affect the brain, lung, heart, eyes, or liver. Symptoms in persons with otherwise healthy immune systems:
Enlarged lymph nodes in the head and neck Headache Mild illness with fever, similar to mononucleosis Muscle pain Sore throat
Symptoms in immunosuppressed persons:
Confusion Fever Headache Retinal inflammation that causes blurred vision Seizures
For symptoms in babies born with the condition, see congenital toxoplasmosis."
4007,Who is at highest risk for Toxoplasmosis ?,"Toxoplasmosis is found in humans worldwide, and in many species of animals and birds. Cats are the definitive host of the parasite. Human infection may result from:
Blood transfusions or solid organ transplants Carelessly handling cat litter, which can lead to accidental consumption of infectious particles Eating contaminated soil Eating raw or undercooked meat (lamb, pork, and beef)
Toxoplasmosis also affects people who have weakened immune systems. The infection may also be passed from an infected mother to her baby through the placenta."
4008,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Toxoplasmosis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of toxoplasmosis. This diosrder requires urgent or emergency care if it occurs in an immunosuppressed person or in a baby, or if confusion, seizures, or other severe symptoms develop."
4009,What to expect if I have Toxoplasmosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acute infection in children may cause swelling of the retina in the eye. In adults with a healthy immune system, toxoplasmosis has a good outcome."
4010,What are the symptoms of Tracheitis?,Deep cough (similar to that caused by croup) Difficulty breathing High fever High-pitched breathing sound (stridor)
4011,What causes Tracheitis?,Bacterial tracheitis is most often caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. It frequently follows a recent viral upper respiratory infection.
4012,Who is at highest risk for Tracheitis ?,"Tracheitis affects mostly young children, possibly because their small trachea is easily blocked by swelling."
4013,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tracheitis ?,"Tracheitis is an emergency medical condition. Go to the emergency room if your child has had a recent upper respiratory infection and suddenly has a high fever, a cough that gets worse, and trouble breathing."
4014,What to expect if I have Tracheitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With prompt treatment, the child should recover."
4015,What are the symptoms of Transient tic disorder?,"The child may have facial tics or tics involving movement of the arms, legs, or other areas.
Tics may involve:
Movements that occur again and again and don't have a rhythm An overwhelming urge to make the movement Brief and jerky movements that include the following: Blinking Clenching the fists Curling the toes Flaring the nostrils Grimacing Jerking the arms Kicking Opening the mouth Raising the eyebrows Shrugging the shoulders Sticking out the tongue
The tics often look like nervous behavior. Tics appear to get worse with stress and do not occur during sleep.
Sounds may also occur, such as:
Clicking Grunting Hissing Moaning Sniffing Snorting Squealing Throat clearing"
4016,What causes Transient tic disorder?,"Transient tic disorder is common in children.
The cause of transient tic disorder can be physical or mental (psychological).
It may be a mild form of Tourette syndrome."
4017,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Transient tic disorder ?,"Talk to your health care provider if you are concerned about a transient tic disorder, especially if it continues or disrupts your child's life.
If you are not sure whether the movements are a tic or a seizure, call your health care provider right away."
4018,What to expect if I have Transient tic disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Simple childhood tics usually disappear over a period of months.
4019,What are the symptoms of Transverse myelitis?,"Transverse myelitis may be either acute (developing over hours to several days) or subacute (usually developing over 1 to 4 weeks). Initial symptoms usually include:
Localized lower back pain Sudden paresthesias (abnormal sensations such as burning, tickling, pricking, or tingling) in the legs, sensory loss, and paraparesis (partial paralysis of the legs) Paraparesis may progress to paraplegia (paralysis of the legs and lower part of the trunk) Urinary bladder and bowel dysfunction is common.
Many patients also report experiencing muscle spasms, a general feeling of discomfort, headache, fever, and loss of appetite. Depending on which segment of the spinal cord is involved, some patients may experience respiratory problems as well.
Initially, people with transverse myelitis may notice that they are stumbling or dragging one foot or that their legs seem heavier than normal. Coordination of hand and arm movements, as well as arm and hand strength may also be compromised. Progression of the disease leads to full paralysis of the legs, requiring the patient to use a wheelchair.
Pain is the primary presenting symptom of transverse myelitis in approximately one-third to one-half of all patients. The pain may be localized in the lower back or may consist of sharp, shooting sensations that radiate down the legs or arms or around the torso.
Patients who experience sensory disturbances often use terms such as numbness, tingling, coldness, or burning to describe their symptoms. Up to 80 percent of those with transverse myelitis report areas of heightened sensitivity to touch, such that clothing or a light touch with a finger causes significant discomfort or pain (a condition called allodynia). Many also experience heightened sensitivity to changes in temperature or to extreme heat or cold.
Bladder and bowel problems may involve increased frequency of the urge to urinate or have bowel movements, incontinence, difficulty voiding, the sensation of incomplete evacuation, and constipation. Over the course of the disease, the majority of people with transverse myelitis will experience one or several of these symptoms."
4020,What causes Transverse myelitis?,"Researchers are uncertain of the exact causes of transverse myelitis. The inflammation that causes such extensive damage to nerve fibers of the spinal cord may result from viral infections or abnormal immune reactions. Transverse myelitis also may occur as a complication of syphilis, measles, Lyme disease, and some vaccinations, including those for chickenpox and rabies. Cases in which a cause cannot be identified are called idiopathic.
Transverse myelitis often develops following viral infections. Infectious agents suspected of causing transverse myelitis include varicella zoster (the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections (otitis media), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (bacterial pneumonia) have also been associated with the condition.
In post-infectious cases of transverse myelitis, immune system mechanisms, rather than active viral or bacterial infections, appear to play an important role in causing damage to spinal nerves. Although researchers have not yet identified the precise mechanisms of spinal cord injury in these cases, stimulation of the immune system in response to infection indicates that an autoimmune reaction may be responsible. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenly attacks the body’s own tissue, causing inflammation and, in some cases, damage to myelin within the spinal cord.
Because some affected individuals also have autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and sarcoidosis, some scientists suggest that transverse myelitis may also be an autoimmune disorder. In addition, some cancers may trigger an abnormal immune response that may lead to transverse myelitis."
4021,Who is at highest risk for Transverse myelitis ?,"Transverse myelitis occurs in adults and children, in both genders, and in all races. No familial predisposition is apparent. A peak in incidence rates (the number of new cases per year) appears to occur between 10 and 19 years and 30 and 39 years. Although only a few studies have examined incidence rates, it is estimated that about 1,400 new cases of transverse myelitis are diagnosed each year in the United States, and approximately 33,000 Americans have some type of disability resulting from the disorder."
4022,What to expect if I have Transverse myelitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Recovery from transverse myelitis usually begins within 2 to 12 weeks of the onset of symptoms and may continue for up to 2 years. However, if there is no improvement within the first 3 to 6 months, significant recovery is unlikely. About one-third of people affected with transverse myelitis experience good or full recovery from their symptoms; they regain the ability to walk normally and experience minimal urinary or bowel effects and paresthesias. Another one-third show only fair recovery and are left with significant deficits such as spastic gait, sensory dysfunction, and prominent urinary urgency or incontinence. The remaining one-third show no recovery at all, remaining wheelchair-bound or bedridden with marked dependence on others for basic functions of daily living. Unfortunately, making predictions about individual cases is difficult. However, research has shown that a rapid onset of symptoms generally results in poorer recovery outcomes.
The majority of people with this disorder experience only one episode although in rare cases recurrent or relapsing transverse myelitis does occur. Some patients recover completely, then experience a relapse. Others begin to recover, then suffer worsening of symptoms before recovery continues. In all cases of relapse, physicians will evaluate possible underlying causes such as MS, NMO, or systemic lupus erythematosus since most people who experience relapse have an identifiable underlying disorder. People with a recurrent relapsing disorder will usually require some type of ongoing therapy that modulates or suppresses the immune system. The propose of such therapies is to reduce the chance of future relapses."
4023,What are the symptoms of Traveler's diarrhea?,"Bacterial and viral TD presents with the sudden onset of bothersome symptoms that can range from mild cramps and urgent loose stools to severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea, although with norovirus vomiting may be more prominent. Untreated bacterial diarrhea lasts 3–7 days. Viral diarrhea generally lasts 2–3 days. Protozoal diarrhea can persist for weeks to months without treatment."
4024,What causes Traveler's diarrhea?,"Traveler's diarrhea may be caused by an infection with either bacteria, virus, or parasite. E. coli (bacterium) is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. It is responsible for approximately 70% to 80% of all cases of traveler's diarrhea."
4025,Who is at highest risk for Traveler%27s diarrhea ?,"The most important determinant of risk is travel destination, and there are regional differences in both the risk for and etiology of diarrhea. The world is generally divided into 3 grades of risk: low, intermediate, and high.
Low-risk countries include the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and countries in Northern and Western Europe. Intermediate-risk countries include those in Eastern Europe, South Africa, and some of the Caribbean islands. High-risk areas include most of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America."
4026,What to expect if I have Traveler%27s diarrhea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases of traveler's diarrhea are self-limited with an excellent outlook/prognosis. In some patients, especially those with concomitant diseases that cause suppression of immunity (e.g. transplant patients or HIV-positive patients), the prognosis may be poorer, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are required to improve the outcomes of the disease."
4027,What causes Trichomoniasis?,"Trichomoniasis is found worldwide. In the United States, the highest number of cases are seen in women between age 16 and 35. Trichomonas vaginalis is spread through sexual contact with an infected partner. This includes penis-to-vagina intercourse or vulva-to-vulva contact. The parasite cannot survive in the mouth or rectum.
The disease can affect both men and women, but the symptoms differ between the two groups. The infection usually does not cause symptoms in men and goes away on its own in a few weeks."
4028,What are the symptoms of Trichomoniasis?,"About 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms. When trichomoniasis does cause symptoms, they can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Some people with symptoms get them within 5 to 28 days after being infected, but others do not develop symptoms until much later. Symptoms can come and go. Having trichomoniasis can make it feel unpleasant to have sex. Without treatment, the infection can last for months or even years.
Women:
Discomfort with intercourse Itching of the inner thighs Vaginal discharge (thin, greenish-yellow, frothy or foamy) Vaginal itching Vulvar itching or swelling of the labia Vaginal odor (foul or strong smell)
Men:
Burning after urination or ejaculation Itching of urethra Slight discharge from urethra
Occasionally, some men with trichomoniasis may develop prostatitis or epididymitis from the infection."
4029,Who is at highest risk for Trichomoniasis ?,"Women between the ages of 16-35 make up the largest demographic affected by Trichomoniasis. Other at-risk groups include persons with a compromised immune system, sexually active individuals engaging with multiple partners, and sexually active individuals who do not use condoms consistently and effectively."
4030,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Trichomoniasis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if any unusual vaginal discharge or irritation is noted. Also call for an appointment if you suspect that you have been exposed to the disease.
4031,What to expect if I have Trichomoniasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With proper treatment, the outcome is likely to be excellent. Individuals, generally, make a full recovery."
4032,What are the symptoms of tropical sprue?,"Abdominal cramps Diarrhea, worse on high-fat diet Excessive gas (flatus) Indigestion Irritability Muscle cramps Numbness Paleness Weight loss
In children, sprue leads to:

4033,What causes tropical sprue?,"This disease is caused by inflammation of, and damage to the small intestine due to having too much of certain types of bacteria in the intestines."
4034,Who is at highest risk for Tropical sprue ?,"Risk factors are:
Living in the tropics Long periods of travel to tropical destinations"
4035,What are the Symptoms of Tuberculosis?,"Latent TB is dormant in the alveoli of the lungs. As active TB develops, the bacteria spread out from the alveoli to the lungs and then to other organ systems. Consequently, depending on which organ system is affected, the symptoms may be variable. The primary stage of TB often doesn't cause symptoms. If symptoms of pulmonary TB occur, they include: 
Cough Night sweats Coughing up blood Excessive sweating, particularly at night Fatigue Fever Unintentional weight loss Shortness of breath Chest pain Wheezing
Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body will vary according to the affected area."
4036,What Causes Tuberculosis?,"Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria often affect the lungs but TB bacteria can damage any part of the body such as the kidney, brain, and spine. If not well-managed, TB disease can be fatal. 
Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is due to the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to anti- TB drugs. This resistance can occur due to misuse or mismanagement of the drugs: 
Patients do not complete their full regimen of treatment Health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or duration for taking the drugs drugs are not always available drugs are of poor quality"
4037,Who is at highest risk for Tuberculosis ?,"Tuberculosis is transmitted from person to person through the air (cough, sneeze, or speaking) and physical contact.
The following individuals are at higher risk for developing active TB:
Elderly Infants Patients with weakened immune systems (AIDS, chemotherapy, diabetes, or certain medications)
Your risk of getting TB increases if you:
Have prolonged frequent contact with TB patients Have poor nutrition Live in a crowded place or with poor hygiene
The following factors may increase the risk of TB infection in a population:
Increase in rate of HIV infections Increase in number of homeless people The appearance of drug-resistant strains of TB
Drug resistance is more common in people who: 
Do not take their TB medicine regularly and are non-compliant. Do not take all of their TB medication as prescribed by their doctors or nurses. Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medication previously. Immigrate from regions of the world where drug-resistant TB is prevalent. Have been in frequent contact with someone who has drug-resistant TB disease"
4038,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tuberculosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have been exposed to TB or traveled to areas with endemic TB disease You develop signs and symptoms of TB Your symptoms continue in spite of treatment New symptoms develop"
4039,Where to Find Medical Care for Tuberculosis?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Tuberculosis
4040,What to expect if I have Tuberculosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Symptoms often improve in 2 - 3 weeks. A chest x-ray will not show this improvement until later. The outlook is excellent if pulmonary TB is diagnosed early and treatment is begun quickly.
The prognosis of multidrug-resistant TB is worse than that of tuberculosis susceptible to the regular common treatment. So it is necessary to do a drug susceptibility test and to monitor adherence to the treatment regimen to avoid new drug resistances and ensure a better prognosis."
4041,What are the symptoms of Tuberculous meningitis?,"The symptoms usually begin gradually, and may include:
Fever and chills Mental status changes Nausea and vomiting Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Severe headache Stiff neck (meningismus)
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Agitation Bulging fontanelles in babies Decreased consciousness Poor feeding or irritability in children Unusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards (opisthotonos)"
4042,What causes Tuberculous meningitis?,"Tuberculous meningitis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. The bacteria spread to the brain and spine from another site in the body. Tuberculous meningitis is a very rare disorder in the U.S."
4043,Who is at highest risk for Tuberculous meningitis ?,"Risk factors include a history of:
AIDS Excessive alcohol use Pulmonary tuberculosis Weakened immune system"
4044,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tuberculous meningitis ?,"Call the local emergency number (such as 911) or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:

4050,What to expect if I have Tumor lysis syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of tumor lysis syndrome is good with treatment and if not associated with renal failure. Without treatment, tumor lysis syndrome will result in cardiac arrhythmia and electrolytes disturbance."
4051,What are the symptoms of Turner syndrome?,"Possible symptoms in young infants include:
Swollen hands and feet Wide and webbed neck
A combination of the following symptoms may be seen in older females:
Absent or incomplete development at puberty, including sparse pubic hair and small breasts
Broad, flat chest shaped like a shield
Drooping eyelids
Dry eyes
Infertility
No periods (absent menstruation)
Short height
Vaginal dryness, can lead to painful intercourse"
4052,What causes Turner syndrome?,"Humans have 46 chromosomes. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. Two of these chromosomes, the sex chromosomes, determine if you become a boy or a girl. Females normally have two of the same sex chromosomes, written as XX. Males have an X and a Y chromosome (written as XY).
In Turner syndrome, cells are missing all or part of an X chromosome. The condition only occurs in females. Most commonly, the female patient has only one X chromosome. Others may have two X chromosomes, but one of them is incomplete. Sometimes, a female has some cells with two X chromosomes, but other cells have only one.
Turner syndrome occurs in about 1 out of 2,000 live births."
4053,Who is at highest risk for Turner syndrome ?,Turner syndrome is a genetic condition that only occurs in females. Females with a family history of Turner syndrome are at risk.
4054,What to expect if I have Turner syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Those with Turner syndrome can have a normal life when carefully monitored by their doctor.
4055,What are the symptoms of Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome?,"The donor twin is usually born smaller than the other twin, usually with paleness, anemia, and dehydration.
The recipient twin is born larger, with redness, too much blood, and increased blood pressure. Because of the increased blood volume, the recipient twin may develop cardiac failure and also require medications to strengthen heart function.
The unequal size of identical twins is referred to as discordant twins."
4056,What causes Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome?,"TTTS occurs when blood moves from one twin to the other.
The twin that loses the blood is called the donor twin. The twin that receives the blood is called the recipient twin.
Both infants may have problems depending on the severity of the transfusion. The donor twin may have too little blood, and the other may have too much blood. The donor twin may need a blood transfusion, while the recipient twin may need to have the amount of blood in his or her body reduced."
4057,What to expect if I have Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If the twin-to-twin transfusion is mild, full recovery is expected for both babies. However, severe cases may result in the death of a twin."
4058,What are the symptoms of Typhoid fever?,"Abdominal pain Agitation Bloody stools Chills Confusion Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit) Delirium Fluctuating mood Hallucinations Nosebleeds Severe fatigue Slow, sluggish, lethargic feeling Weakness"
4059,What causes Typhoid fever?,"The bacteria that causes typhoid fever -- S. typhi -- spreads through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated, the bacteria enters your body, and goes into your intestines, and then into your bloodstream, where it can travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body. A few people can become carriers of S. typhi and continue to release the bacteria in their stools for years, spreading the disease. Typhoid fever is common in developing countries, but fewer than 400 cases are reported in the U.S. each year. Most cases in the U.S. are brought in from overseas."
4060,Who is at highest risk for Typhoid fever ?,Anyone who has been in contact with Salmonella Tyhpi bacteria.
4061,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Typhoid fever ?,"Call your health care provider if you have had any known exposure to typhoid fever or if you have been in an endemic area and symptoms of typhoid fever develop. Also call your health care provider if you have had typhoid fever and relapse occurs or if severe abdominal pain, decreased urine output, or other new symptoms develop."
4062,What to expect if I have Typhoid fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Symptoms usually improve in 2 to 4 weeks with treatment. The outcome is likely to be good with early treatment, but becomes poor if complications develop. Symptoms may return if the treatment has not completely cured the infection."
4063,What are the symptoms of Typhus?,"Symptoms of murine or endemic typhus may include:
Abdominal pain Backache Diarrhea Dull red rash that begins on the middle of the body and spreads Extremely high fever (105 - 106 degrees Fahrenheit), which may last up to 2 weeks Hacking, dry cough Headache Joint and muscle pain Nausea Vomiting
Symptoms of epidemic typhus may include:
Chills Cough Delirium High fever (104 degrees Fahrenheit) Joint pain (arthralgia) Lights that appear very bright; light may hurt the eyes Low blood pressure Rash that begins on the chest and spreads to the rest of the body (except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet) Severe headache Severe muscle pain (myalgia) Stupor
The early rash is a light rose color and fades when you press on it. Later, the rash becomes dull and red and does not fade. People with severe typhus may also develop small areas of bleeding into the skin (petechiae)."
4064,What causes Typhus?,"Typhus is caused by one of two types of bacteria: Rickettsia typhi or Rickettsia prowazekii. The form of typus depends on which type of bacteria causes the infection. Rickettsia typhi causes murine or endemic typhus. Endemic typhus is uncommon in the United States. It is usually seen in areas where hygiene is poor and the temperature is cold. Endemic typhus is sometimes called ""jail fever."" Murine typhus occurs in the southeastern and southern United States, often during the summer and fall. It is rarely deadly. Risk factors for murine typhus include:
Exposure to rat fleas or rat feces Exposure to other animals (such as cats, opossums, raccoons, skunks, and rats)
Rickettsia prowazekii causes epidemic typhus and Brill-Zinsser disease. Brill-Zinsser disease is a mild form of epidemic typhus. It occurs when the disease re-activates in a person who was previously infected. It is more common in the elderly. Lice and fleas of flying squirrels spread the bacteria."
4065,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Typhus ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of typhus. This serious disorder can require emergency care.
4066,What to expect if I have Typhus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, death may occur in 10 - 60% of patients with epidemic typhus. Patients over age 60 have the highest risk of death. Patients who receive treatment quickly should completely recover. Less than 2% of untreated patients with murine typhus may die. Prompt antibiotic treatment will cure nearly all patients. Possible Complications
Renal insufficiency Pneumonia Central nervous system damage"
4067,What are the symptoms of Upper gastrointestinal bleeding?,"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is usually seen as
Bloody vomit Vomit that looks like coffee grounds Bowel movements that are black and sticky"
4068,What causes Upper gastrointestinal bleeding?,"The most common cause of upper GI bleeding is an ulcer in the stomach or small intestine. Irritation of the stomach or esophagus can also cause an upper GI bleed. A group of medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, are common causes of stomach and esophagus irritation. *Another common cause of bleeding is liver disease from chronic alcohol use. Sometimes the esophagus bleeds because it is torn after forceful coughing or vomiting."
4069,Who is at highest risk for Upper gastrointestinal bleeding ?,"Common risk factors in the development of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include:
Advancing age Previous history of gastrointestinal bleed Chronic kidney disease Underlying cardiovascular disease Cirrhosis and portal hypertension Presence of H.pylori infection NSAID's or aspirin use in patients with a history of ulcer disease Patients taking glucocorticoids"

4072,What are the symptoms of urea cycle disorder?,"Typically, the baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This usually occurs within the first week after birth.
Symptoms include:
Confusion Decreased food intake Disliking protein-containing foods Increased sleepiness, difficulty waking up Nausea, vomiting"
4073,What causes urea cycle disorder?,"The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.
The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.
Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder are missing a gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.
These diseases include:
Argininosuccinic aciduria Arginase deficiency Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency Citrullinemia N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency (NAGS) Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC)
As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of these disorders."
4074,Who is at highest risk for Urea cycle disorder ?,"Boys are more often affected by ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and develop the disease later in life.
To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry the gene until their child gets the disorder."
4075,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Urea cycle disorder ?,"If your child has a test that shows increased ammonia in the blood, have the child examined by a genetic or metabolic specialist. If there is a family history of urea cycle disorder, seek genetic counseling before trying to get pregnant.
A dietician is important to help plan and update a protein-restricted diet as the child grows."
4076,What to expect if I have Urea cycle disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well patients do depends on:
Which urea cycle abnormality they have How severe it is How early it is discovered How closely they follow a protein-restricted diet
Babies diagnosed in the first week of life and put on a protein-restricted diet right away do well.
Sticking to the diet can lead to normal adult intelligence. Repeatedly not following the diet or having stress-induced symptoms can lead to brain swelling and brain damage.
Major stresses, such as surgery or accidents, can be complicated for these patients. Extreme care is needed to avoid problems during such periods."
4077,What are the symptoms of Urethral cancer?,"Signs of urethral cancer include bleeding or trouble with urination.
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by urethral cancer or by other conditions. There may be no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:
Trouble starting the flow of urine. Weak or interrupted (""stop-and-go"") flow of urine. Frequent urination, especially at night. Incontinence. Discharge from the urethra. Bleeding from the urethra or blood in the urine. A lump or thickness in the perineum or penis. A painless lump or swelling in the groin."
4078,Who is at highest risk for Urethral cancer ?,"Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for urethral cancer include the following:
Having a history of bladder cancer. Having conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the urethra, including: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV t ype 16 Frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)"
4079,What to expect if I have Urethral cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of urethral cancer depends on the following factors:
Anatomical location Size Stage Depth of invasion
Superficial tumors located in the distal urethra of both the female and male are generally curable. However, deeply invasive lesions are rarely curable by any combination of therapies. In men, the prognosis of tumors in the dista l (pendulous) urethra is better than for tumors of the proximal (bulbomembranous) and prostatic urethra, which tend to present at more advanced stages. Likewise, distal urethral tumors tend to occur at earlier stages in women, and they appear to have a better prognosis than proximal tumors."
4080,What are the symptoms of Urinary tract infection?,"The symptoms of a bladder infection include:
Cloudy or bloody urine, which may have a foul or strong odor Low fever (not everyone will have a fever) Pain or burning with urination Pressure or cramping in the lower abdomen (usually middle) or back Strong need to urinate often, even right after the bladder has been emptied
If the infection spreads to your kidneys, symptoms may include:
Chills and shaking or night sweats Fatigue and a general ill feeling Fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit Flank (side), back, or groin pain Flushed, warm, or reddened skin Mental changes or confusion (in the elderly, these symptoms often are the only signs of a UTI) Nausea and vomiting Severe abdominal pain (sometimes)"
4081,What causes Urinary tract infection?,"Urinary tract infections are caused by germs, usually bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. This can lead to infection, most commonly in the bladder itself, which can spread to the kidneys.Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk of having UTIs.Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk of a UTI. The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI:
Diabetes Advanced age (especially people in nursing homes) Problems emptying your bladder completely (urinary retention) A tube called a urinary catheter inserted into your urinary tract Bowel incontinence Enlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urine Kidney stones Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture) Pregnancy Surgery or other procedure involving the urinary tract"
4082,Who is at highest risk for Urinary tract infection ?,"Women are more prone to urinary tract infections as germs in the vagina can be pushed into the urethra during regular bowel movements, sexual intercourse, or use of certain birth control methods such as diaphragms. Individuals with catheters are also at an increased risk for urinary tract infections as germs can travel through the catheter tube. Individuals with decreased immune capacity are also at risk."
4083,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Urinary tract infection ?,"Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call right away if the following symptoms develop:
Back or side pain Chills Fever Vomiting
These may be signs of a possible kidney infection.
Also call if you have already been diagnosed with a UTI and the symptoms come back shortly after treatment with antibiotics."
4084,What to expect if I have Urinary tract infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A urinary tract infection is uncomfortable, but treatment is usually successful. Symptoms of a bladder infection usually disappear within 24 - 48 hours after treatment begins. If you have a kidney infection, it may take 1 week or longer for your symptoms to go away."
4085,What are the symptoms of Uterine cancer?,"Early uterine cancer does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Unusual vaginal bleeding
Trouble urinating
Pelvic pain and pain during intercourse
Fatigue and unexplained weight loss
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell their doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4086,Who is at highest risk for Uterine cancer ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of uterine cancer is related to several factors. Abnormal estrogen levels may be the most important indicator.
Hormone levels: Any change in the balance of estrogen and progesterone that leads to the production of more estrogen increases the risk for developing endometrial cancer.
Estrogen therapy: Clinical data shows the use of estrogen without progesterone can lead to endometrial cancer.
Birth control pills: Clinical observations suggest that the use of birth control pills can lower the risk of endometrial cancer.
Total number of menstrual cycles: Medical studies show that more menstrual cycles during a woman’s lifetime raises her risk of endometrial cancer.
Pregnancy: Studies show that a higher number of pregnancies may protect against endometrial cancer because of the the shift towards more progesterone during the pregnancy period.
Obesity: Besides ovaries, estrogen can also be produced by fat tissue. So, women with more fat tissue in their bodies have higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. After menopause, estrogen produced by the fat tissue has a larger influence than it did before menopause.
Tamoxifen: As a drug used to treat chest cancer, Tamoxifen effects the tissue in the chest and the tissue in the uterus very differently. It promotes the grow of the endometrium and increases the risk of endometrial cancer.
Ovarian tumors: The granulosa-theca cell tumor, one type of ovarian tumor, can produce estrogen and increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
Polycystic ovarian syndrome: This is a condition with abnormal hormone levels, such as higher estrogen levels and lower levels of progesterone. This can also increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
A diet high in animal fat
Endometrial hyperplasia: Atypical hyperplasia is a precancerous lesion of endometrial cancer.
Prior pelvic radiation therapy: Radiation can increase the risk of endometrial cancer by damaging the DNA of cells.
Diabetes: Epidemiological data shows that endometrial cancer may be as much as four times more common in women with diabetes.
Family history: Clinical survey's show peeople with a family history of endometrial cancer have a higher risk of developing the disease.
Age: The risk of endometrial cancer increases as women become older."
4087,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Uterine cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of uterine cancer develop. If you experience a larger amount of vaginal bleeding, seek urgent medical care as soon as possible."
4088,What to expect if I have Uterine cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Generally speaking, the prognosis of uterine cancer is relatively good because it can be diagnosed in the early stages. The prognosis depends on the following:
The stage of uterine cancer
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery
The patient’s general health
Endometrial cancer is usually diagnosed at an early stage. The 1-year survival rate is about 92%. The 5-year survival rate for endometrial cancer that has not spread is 95%. If the cancer has spread to distant organs, the 5-year survival rate drops to 23%."
4089,What are the symptoms of Uterine fibroids?,"More common symptoms of uterine fibroids are:
Abdominal fullness, gas, or constipation Bleeding between periods Increase in urinary frequency Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), sometimes with the passage of blood clots Menstrual periods that may last longer than normal Pelvic cramping or pain with periods Sensation of fullness or pressure in lower abdomen Pain during intercourse"
4090,What causes Uterine fibroids?,"Uterine fibroids are the most common pelvic tumor. As many as 1 in 5 women may have fibroids during their childbearing years (the time after starting menstruation for the first time and before menopause).
Fibroids usually affect women over age 30. They are rare in women under 20, and often shrink and cause no symptoms in women who have gone through menopause. They are more common in African Americans than Caucasians.
The cause of uterine fibroid tumors is unknown. However, fibroid growth seems to depend on the hormone estrogen. As long as a woman with fibroids is menstruating, a fibroid will probably continue to grow, usually slowly.
Fibroids can be so tiny that you need a microscope to see them. However, they can grow very large. They may fill the entire uterus, and may weigh several pounds. Although it is possible for just one fibroid to develop, usually there are more than one.
Fibroids are often described by their location in the uterus:
Myometrial: in the muscle wall of the uterus Submucosal: just under the surface of the uterine lining Subserosal: just under the outside covering of the uterus Pendunculated: occurring on a long stalk on the outside of the uterus or inside the cavity of the uterus"
4091,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Uterine fibroids ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have gradual changes in your menstrual pattern, including a heavier flow, increased cramping, or bleeding between periods Fullness or heaviness develops in your lower abdomen"
4092,What to expect if I have Uterine fibroids  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some women with fibroids have no symptoms and may not need treatment.
During a pregnancy, existing fibroids may grow due to the increased blood flow and estrogen levels. The fibroids usually return to their original size after the baby is delivered."
4093,What are the symptoms of Uveitis?,"Uveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may develop rapidly and may vary depending on the form of uveitis:  Anterior uveitis
Light sensitivity Eye redness, tenderness, or pain Difficulty focusing on objects
Intermediate and Posterior Uveitis 
Floaters Blurry vision Difficulty focusing on objects Chronic inflammation lasting for at least six weeks
Panuveitis 
Floaters Blurry vision Vision loss"
4094,What causes Uveitis?,"Uveitis can have many causes, including injury to the eye, viruses, bacteria, parasites, and exposure to toxic substances such as acid. Uveitis can also be caused by inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, or genetics. However, in many cases the cause is unknown.
Uveitis can be associated with any of the following:
AIDS Ankylosing spondylitis Behcet syndrome CMV retinitis Herpes zoster infection Histoplasmosis Injury Kawasaki disease Psoriasis Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Sarcoidosis Syphilis Toxoplasmosis Tuberculosis Ulcerative colitis
Additionally, the causes may vary depending on the form of uveitis:
Anterior uveitis may be associated with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people for unapparent reasons. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.
Intermediate uveitis usually occurs in young men and is generally not associated with any other disease. In most cases, the cause is unknown . However, some evidence suggests it may be linked to Crohn's disease and possibly multiple sclerosis .
Posterior uveitis may develop in people who have an autoimmune disease or who have had a systemic (body-wide) infection. The most common cause of posterior uveitis is infections resulting from toxoplasmosis"
4095,Who is at highest risk for Uveitis ?,"People of all ages and both sexes can develop uveitis, although it is more common in women. Additionally, people are more likely to develop uveitis as they age ."
4096,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Uveitis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of uveitis (e.g. eye pain or reduced vision). Uveitis requires an urgent referral and thorough examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist along with urgent treatment to control the inflammation.
4097,What to expect if I have Uveitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When left untreated, uveitis can lead to permanent vision loss. Additionally, a more serious, potentially life-threatening medical condition could worsen if the uveitis is caused by an underlying disorder that is left untreated. Uveitis is estimated to be responsible for approximately 10% of the blindness in the United States. 
With proper treatment, most attacks of anterior uveitis go away in a few days to weeks. However, relapses are common.
Inflammation related to posterior uveitis may last from months to years and may cause permanent vision damage, even with treatment.
Possible complications of uveitis include:
Cataracts Fluid within the retina Glaucoma Retinal detachment Vision loss"
4098,What are the symptoms of Vaginal cancer?,"Early vaginal cancer does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Abnormal vaginal bleeding, often after intercourse Abnormal vaginal discharge A mass that can be felt Pain during intercourse
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
Diseases with similar symptoms are the following:
Vaginal cyst Vaginal node of endometriosis Uterine fibroids"
4099,Who is at highest risk for Vaginal cancer ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of vaginal cancer is related to several factors.
Vaginal adenosis: Clinical research suggest that having adenosis increases the risk of developing clear cell carcinoma. Although it is very small, many doctors feel that any woman with adenosis should have very careful screening and follow-up. Cervical cancer: Surveies show having cervical cancer increases the risk of vaginal squamous cell cancer. This is most likely because cervical and vaginal cancers have similar risk factors. Diethylstilbestrol (DES): Clinical data show women whose mothers took Diethylstilbestrol (DES) develop clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina more often than would normally be expected. These women are called ""DES daughters"". Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection: Certain types of HPV (type 16 and 18) have been strongly associated with vaginal cancers. HIV infection: Clinical studies show human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also increases the risk of vaginal cancer. Unhealthy lifestyle: Epidemiological research demonstrates smoking and alcohol increase th erisk of vaginal cancer. Age: Vaginal cancer is always found in women above 70 years old."
4100,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vaginal cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of vaginal cancer develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
A large amount of vaginal bleeding"
4101,How will Vaginal cancer affect my sex life?,"Impact of the cancer on sex life vary greatly among people with some people having no or little change based on the physical and emotional stress they are experiencing. Some people feel even closer to their partners and have increased desire for sex during this time. Though pregnancy may be possible during the treatment, it is not recommended as some drugs could cause birth defects.
Radiotherapy for vaginal cancer can cause an early menopause as well as scarring, dryness and vaginal narrowing and may be associated with pain when having sex, and delicate skin inside the vagina. Your doctor may advice you to use dilators to stop the vagina shrinking and narrowing and some gels and creams to moisturise the vagina and prevent soreness."
4102,What to expect if I have Vaginal cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of vaginal cancer depends primarily on the following:
Location of the tumor in vagina Length of the tumor in vaginal wall Stage of the cancer General health of the patient"
4103,What are the symptoms of Vaginismus?,Vaginal penetration during sex is difficult or impossible. Vaginal pain is common during sexual intercourse or an attempted pelvic exam.
4104,What causes Vaginismus?,"Vaginismus is considered a disorder of sexual dysfunction. It has several possible causes, including past sexual trauma or abuse, psychological factors, or a history of discomfort with sexual intercourse. Sometimes no cause can be found.
Vaginismus is an uncommon condition. The exact number of women who have this problem is unknown.
Women with varying degrees of vaginismus often develop anxiety regarding sexual intercourse. The condition causes penetration to be difficult and painful, or even impossible. However, this does not mean the woman cannot become sexually aroused. Many women may have orgasms when the clitoris is stimulated."
4105,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vaginismus ?,"If you have pain associated with intercourse or difficulties with successful vaginal penetration, contact your health care provider."
4106,What to expect if I have Vaginismus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When treated by a specialist in sex therapy, success rates are generally very high."
4107,What are the symptoms of Vaginitis?,"Irritation and itching of the genital area Inflammation (irritation, redness, and swelling) of the labia majora, labia minora, or perineal area Vaginal discharge Foul vaginal odor Discomfort or burning when urinating"
4108,What causes Vaginitis?,"Vulvovaginitis can affect women of all ages and is extremely common. It can be caused by bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and other parasites. Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can also cause vulvovaginitis, as can various chemicals found in bubble baths, soaps, and perfumes. Environmental factors such as poor hygiene and allergens may also cause this condition. Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vulvovaginitis in women of all ages. Antibiotic use can lead to yeast infections by killing the normal antifungal bacteria that live in the vagina. Yeast infections typically cause genital itching and a thick, white vaginal discharge, and other symptoms.
Another cause of vulvovaginitis is bacterial vaginosis, an overgrowth of certain types of bacteria in the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis may cause a thin, grey vaginal discharge and a fishy odor. An STI called trichomonas vaginitis infection is another common cause. This infection leads to genital itching, a vaginal odor, and a heavy vaginal discharge, which may be yellow-grey or green in color.
Bubble baths, soaps, vaginal contraceptives, feminine sprays, and perfumes can cause irritating itchy rashes in the genital area, while tight-fitting or nonabsorbent clothing sometimes cause heat rashes. Irritated tissue is more susceptible to infection than normal tissue, and many infection-causing organisms thrive in environments that are warm, damp, and dark. Not only can these factors contribute to the cause of vulvovaginitis, they frequently prolong the recovery period. A lack of estrogen in postmenopausal women can result in vaginal dryness and thinning of vaginal and vulvar skin, which may also lead to or worsen genital itching and burning. Some skin conditions can cause itching and chronic irritation of the vulvar area. Foreign bodies, such as lost tampons, can also cause vulvar irritation and itching and strong smelling discharge. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis (where specific cause cannot be identified) can be seen in all age groups, but it occurs most commonly in young girls before puberty. Once puberty begins, the vagina becomes more acidic, which tends to help prevent infections. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis can occur in girls with poor genital hygiene and is characterized by a foul-smelling, brownish-green discharge and irritation of the labia and vaginal opening. This condition is often associated with an overgrowth of a type of bacteria that is typically found in the stool. These bacteria are sometimes spread from the rectum to the vaginal area by wiping from back to front after using the bathroom. Sexual abuse should be considered in children with unusual infections and recurrent episodes of unexplained vulvovaginitis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the organism that causes gonorrhea, produces gonococcal vulvovaginitis in young girls who have sexual exposure. Gonorrhea-related vaginitis is considered a sexually transmitted illness. If lab tests confirm this diagnosis, young girls should be evaluated for sexual abuse."
4109,Who is at highest risk for Vaginitis ?,"Vulvovaginitis can affect women of all ages and is extremely common. It can be caused by bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and other parasites. Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can also cause vulvovaginitis, as can various chemicals found in bubble baths, soaps, and perfumes. Environmental factors such as poor hygiene and allergens may also cause this condition."
4110,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vaginitis ?,Call your health care provider if vulvovaginitis symptoms are present or if known vulvovaginitis does not respond to treatment.
4111,What to expect if I have Vaginitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Proper treatment of an infection is usually very effective.
4112,Who is at highest risk for Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ?,"VRE infections are more common in patients who:
Are in the hospital, especially if they are taking antibiotics for a long time Are older or who have long-term illnesses and weak immune systems Have been treated before with vancomycin or other antibiotics for a long time Have been in intensive care units or cancer or transplant units Have had major surgery Have catheters to drain urine or intravenous (IV) catheters that stay in for a long time"
4113,What are the symptoms of Viral gastroenteritis?,"Abdominal pain Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting
Other symptoms may include:
Chills Clammy skin Excessive sweating Fever Joint stiffness Leakage (incontinence) of stool Muscle pain Poor feeding Vomiting blood (very rare) Weight loss"
4114,What causes Viral gastroenteritis?,"Viral gastroenteritis is a leading cause of severe diarrhea in both adults and children. Many types of viruses can cause gastroenteritis. The most common ones are:
Astrovirus Enteric adenovirus Norovirus (also called Norwalk-like virus). It is common among school-age children. Rotavirus, the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children. It can also infect adults exposed to children with the virus. Outbreaks may also occur in nursing homes. These viruses are often found in contaminated food or drinking water. Symptoms of viral gastroenteritis usually appear within 4 - 48 hours after exposure to the contaminated food or water.
Those with the highest risk for severe gastroenteritis include the young, the elderly, and people who have suppressed immune systems."
4115,Who is at highest risk for Viral gastroenteritis ?,It can occur in any age group and is seen frequently in both children and adults.
4116,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Viral gastroenteritis ?,"Call your health care provider if diarrhea persists for more than several days or if dehydration occurs. You should also contact your doctor if you or your child has these symptoms:
Blood in the stool Confusion Dizziness Dry mouth Feeling faint Nausea No tears when crying No urine for 8 hours or more Sunken appearance to the eyes Sunken soft spot on an infant's head (fontanelle)"
4117,What to expect if I have Viral gastroenteritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most infections will go away on their own. Children may become severely ill from dehydration caused by diarrhea.
4118,What are the symptoms of Viral hemorrhagic fever?,"Signs and symptoms may vary according to the disease, but in general, patients with VHF present with:
Abrupt onset of fever Myalgias Prostration Coagulopathy with:
Petechial rash Ecchymoses, sometimes with overt bleeding
Vascular endothelial damage may lead to:
Shock, Pulmonary edema Liver injury
Signs seen with specific viruses may include:
Renal failure (HFRS) Ecchymoses (CCHF) Hearing loss Anasarca Shock in newborns (Lassa fever), and spontaneous abortion (Lassa and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses)
Because the incubation period may be as long as 21 days, patients may not develop illness until returning from travel; therefore, a thorough travel and exposure history are critical."
4119,What causes Viral hemorrhagic fever?,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are caused by several families of enveloped RNA viruses, including:
Filoviruses, such as Ebola and Marburg viruses Arenaviruses, such as Lassa fever, Lujo, Guanarito, Machupo, Junin, Sabia, and Chapare viruses Bunyaviruses, such as Rift Valley fever (RVF), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF Hantaviruses Flaviviruses, such as dengue, yellow fever, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest disease, and Alkhurma viruses
These families of viruses share some common features, including:
Are all RNA viruses, and all are covered, or enveloped, in a fatty coating The survival of the virus depends on an animal or insect host (natural reservoir) The viruses are restricted to their hosts' area The virus has human and animal hosts Humans can transmit the virus among them Outbreaks of theses viruses occur rarely and are not possible to predict There is generally no cure or established treatment for VHFs Seldom other viruses and bacteria can cause a hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus
The virus responsible for the VHF may be transmitted through:
Contact with urine, fecal matter, saliva, or other body excretions from infected rodents Mosquito or tick bites When crushing a tick. Some of these vectors may spread the virus to animals, which will then transmit it to humans Person-to-person (Ebola, Margurg or Lassa), through direct contact or through infected surfaces"
4120,Who is at highest risk for Viral hemorrhagic fever ?,"Some VHFs are spread on person to person basis, through direct contact with symptomatic patients, body fluids, cadavers or through inadequate infection control measures (filoviruses, arenaviruses, CCHF virus). Zoonotic spread includes the following:
Livestock - via slaughter or consumption of raw milk or meat from infected animals (CCHF, RVF, Alkhurma viruses) Bushmeat - likely via slaughter or consumption of infected animals (Ebola, Marburg viruses) Rodent - (arenaviruses, hantaviruses) via inhalation or contact with contaminated materials Mosquitos (RVF virus) or ticks bites (CCHF, Omsk, Kyasanur Forest disease, Alkhurma viruses) Other reservoir species - such as bats (Ebola, Marburg viruses)"
4121,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Viral hemorrhagic fever ?,"If you think you are developing symptoms of this disease contact your doctor. Common symptoms of Viral hemorrhagic fever include:
Fever Bleeding, under the skin and/or through body orificies, such as: mouth, eyes, or ears Fatigue Dizziness Muscle pain Weakness Exhaustion Seizures Kidney problems"
4122,What to expect if I have Viral hemorrhagic fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Hemorrhagic fever varies in severity. Severe infections with internal bleeding and fever (hemorrhagic fever) are deadly in up to half of cases.
4123,What are the symptoms of Viral meningitis ?,"Abdominal pain Abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia) Chills Confusion Drowsiness Fever General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) Headache Muscle pain Nausea and vomiting Rash Sore throat Stiff neck"
4124,What are the causes of Viral meningitis ?,"There are many causes of aseptic meningitis, including:
Cancer (causes a syndrome similar to meningitis) Infections near the brain or spinal cord, such as epidural abscesses Fungi Medications (cause a syndrome similar to meningitis) Mycobacteria (nontuberculous) Syphilis Tick-borne diseases (such as Lyme disease) Tuberculosis Viruses
About half of aseptic meningitis cases are caused by coxsackie virus or echovirus, two members of the enterovirus family. The rate of enteroviral infections increases in the summer and early fall. Enteroviruses are spread by hand-to-mouth contact and coughing. They also may be spread by contact with fecal matter. Other viruses that cause this condition include:
Chickenpox (varicella virus) Other enteroviruses Herpes simplex viruses, usually type 2 HIV (especially acute HIV syndrome) Mumps Rabies virus West Nile virus
Risk factors for aseptic meningitis include:
Being a health care worker Having a weakened immune system Exposure to children in a day care setting Exposure to someone with a recent viral infection"
4125,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Viral meningitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of aseptic meningitis.
4126,What to expect if I have Viral meningitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Unlike other forms of meningitis, aseptic meningitis caused by a virus is usually a harmless disease. Less than 1% of patients have lasting symptoms. People usually recover fully 5 - 14 days after symptoms start. Fatigue and lightheadedness may last longer in some people."
4127,What causes Virilization?,"Virilization may be caused by:
Excess testosterone production Use of anabolic steroids
In newborn girls, the condition may be caused by:
Certain medications taken by the mother during pregnancy Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in the baby or her mother Other medical conditions in the mother (such as tumors of the ovaries or adrenal glands that release male hormones)"
4128,What are the symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency?,"People with mild anemia may have no symptoms, or symptoms may be very mild.
More typical symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia include:
Diarrhea or constipation Fatigue, lack of energy, or light-headedness when standing up or with exertion Loss of appetite Pale skin Problems concentrating Shortness of breath, mostly during exercise Swollen, red tongue or bleeding gums
Symptoms from nerve damage caused by vitamin B12 deficiency that has been present for a longer time include:
Confusion or change in mental status (dementia) in severe cases Depression Loss of balance Numbness and tingling of hands and feet"
4129,What causes Vitamin B12 deficiency?,"Your body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. In order to provide vitamin B12 to your cells:
You must eat enough foods that contain vitamin B12, such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. Your body must absorb enough vitamin B12. Your body uses a special protein, called intrinsic factor, released by cells in the stomach. The combination of vitamin B12 attached to intrinsic factor is absorbed in the last part of the small intestine.
A lack of vitamin B12 in the diet may be due to:
Eating a vegetarian diet Poor diet in infancy Poor nutrition during pregnancy
A number of problems can make it difficult for your body to absorb enough vitamin B12:
Chronic alcoholism Crohn's disease, celiac disease, infection with the fish tapeworm, or other problems that make it difficult for your body to digest foods Pernicious anemia, which occurs when your body destroys cells that make intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is needed to absorb vitamin B12. Surgeries that remove certain parts of your stomach or small intestine, such as some weight-loss surgeries Taking antacids and other heartburn medicines for a long period of time"
4130,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vitamin B12 deficiency ?,Call your health care provider if you have any of the symptoms of anemia.
4131,What to expect if I have Vitamin B12 deficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treatment for this form of anemia is usually effective. Any damage to the nerves may be permanent, especially if treatment is not started within 6 months of when the symptoms begin."
4132,What are the symptoms of Volvulus?,"Bloody or dark red stools Constipation or difficulty releasing stools Distended abdomen Pain or tenderness in the abdomen Nausea or vomiting Shock Vomiting green material
Symptoms are usually severe enough that infants are taken early to the emergency room, which can be critical for survival."
4133,What are the causes of Volvulus?,"A birth defect called intestinal malrotation can make infants more likely to develop a volvulus. However, a volvulus can occur without malrotation.
Volvulus due to malrotation often occurs early in life, usually in the first year."
4134,Who is at risk for Volvulus?,Young children Children with a birth defect called intestinal malrotation
4135,How to know you have Volvulus (Diagnosis)?,"The following tests are done to diagnose volvulus
Barium enema Blood tests to check electrolytes CT scan Stool guaiac (shows blood in the stool) Upper GI"
4136,What are the symptoms of Von Willebrand disease?,Abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding Bleeding of the gums without apparent cause Easy bruising Nosebleeds Skin rash Prolonged bleeding after dental work
4137,What causes Von Willebrand disease?,"Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor helps blood platelets clump together and stick to the blood vessel wall, which is necessary for normal blood clotting. There are several types of Von Willebrand disease.
Von Willebrand disease affects men and women equally. Most cases are mild. Bleeding may occur after surgery or when you have a tooth pulled. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or naproxen can make this condition worse."
4138,Who is at highest risk for Von Willebrand disease ?,"A family history of a bleeding disorder is the primary risk factor. In women with heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, von Willebrand is more common in Caucasian women than in African American women. The majority of women with heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding do NOT have Von Willebrand disease."
4139,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Von Willebrand disease ?,"Call your health care provider if bleeding occurs without reason.
If you have von Willebrand disease and are scheduled for surgery or are in an accident, be sure you or your family notify the health care providers about your condition."
4140,What to expect if I have Von Willebrand disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis is overall very good, most patients have mild forms of the disease and can expect normal lifespan. Patients with more severe forms of the disease may require treatment and need to avoid contact sports, but prognosis is still generally good. Women who have this condition generally do NOT have excessive bleeding during childbirth.
This disease is passed down through families. Therefore, genetic counseling may help prospective parents understand the risk to their children."
4141,What are the symptoms of Vulvar cancer?,"Early vulvar cancer does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
A lump in the vulva
Vulvar itching or tenderness
Bleeding that is not your period
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4142,Who is at highest risk for Vulvar cancer ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of vulvar cancer is related to several factors.
Human papilloma virus (HPV): Clinical survey shows HPV infection is thought to be responsible for up to half of vulvar cancers overall, and most of the cases that occur in younger women. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): Scientists found that HIV can damage the body's immune system and make women more susceptible to persistent HPV infections. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN): Clinical data suggest that women with VIN have an increased risk of developing invasive vulvar cancer. Lichen sclerosus (LS): Epidemiological data show about 4% of women with LS develope vulvar cancer later. Melanoma or atypical moles: Epidemiological data have verified that melanoma or atypical moles increase the risk of developing vulvar cancer. Smoking: Smoking can further increases the risk of developing vulvar cancer. Age: The risk of vulvar cancer goes up with age and the average age of women diagnosed with invasive vulvar cancer is 70."
4143,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vulvar cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of vulvar cancer develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
A large amount of bleeding in vulva"
4144,What to expect if I have Vulvar cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis depends on:
The stage of the cancer Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The patient’s general health Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
4145,How will vulvar cancer affect my sex life?,"Impact of the cancer on sex life vary greatly among people with some people having no or little change based on the physical and emotional stress they are experiencing. Some people feel even closer to their partners and have increased desire for sex during this time. Though pregnancy may be possible during the treatment, it is not recommended as some drugs could cause birth defects.
Radiotherapy for vulvar cancer can cause an early menopause as well as scarring, dryness and vaginal narrowing and may be associated with pain when having sex. Your doctor may advice you to use dilators to stop the vagina shrinking and narrowing and some gels and creams to moisturise the vagina and vulva and prevent soreness."
4146,What are the symptoms of Warthin's tumor?,"Early Warthin's tumor does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Swollen salivary gland Lump near back of lower jaw Jaw pain Sensation of pressure Facial nerve paralysis Tinnitus Impaired hearing Earache
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4147,Who is at highest risk for Warthin%27s tumor ?,The cause of Warthin's tumor is not clear. But clinical data suggest that smoking has a close relationship with Warthin's tumor.
4148,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Warthin%27s tumor ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of Warthin's tumor develop.
4149,What are the symptoms of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome?,"Symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy:
Confusion Loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) Leg tremor Vision changes Abnormal eye movements (back and forth movements called nystagmus) Double vision Eyelid drooping
Symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome:
Inability to form new memories Loss of memory, can be severe Making up stories (confabulation) Seeing or hearing things that aren't really there (hallucinations)
Note: There may also be symptoms of alcohol withdrawal."
4150,What causes Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome?,"Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are different conditions that are both due to brain damage caused by a lack of vitamin B1 (thiamine).
A lack of vitamin B1 is common in people with alcoholism. It is also common in persons whose bodies do not absorb food properly (malabsorption), such as sometimes occurs after obesity surgery.
Korsakoff syndrome, or Korsakoff psychosis, tends to develop as Wernicke's symptoms go away. Wernicke's encephalopathy causes brain damage in lower parts of the brain called the thalamus and hypothalamus. Korsakoff psychosis results from damage to areas of the brain involved with memory."
4151,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider or go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, or if you have been diagnosed with the condition and your symptoms get worse or return."
4152,What to expect if I have Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without treatment, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome gets steadily worse and can be life threatening. With treatment, you can control symptoms (such as uncoordinated movement and vision difficulties), and slow or stop the disorder from getting worse.
Some symptoms -- especially the loss of memory and thinking skills -- may be permanent. Other disorders related to alcohol abuse may also occur."
4153,What are the symptoms of West nile virus disease?,"Most people who are infected with West Nile virus have no symptoms. Others may have only mild symptoms, which is called West Nile fever. Symptoms include:
Skin rash Fever Headache Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Swollen lymph nodes (lymph glands) An achy feeling in the back and muscles
Symptoms usually occur 3 to 14 days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito and last for 3 to 6 days. Symptoms of the more severe illness the West Nile virus include:
A sudden high fever (above 102°F) Severe headache Stiff neck Feeling disorientated or confused Tremors or muscle jerks Seizures Coma Weakness or partial paralysis
These symptoms may last for several weeks. Contact your doctor if you have any of these symptoms and have recently been bitten by a mosquito.
In rare cases, West Nile virus causes a disease such as a swelling of the brain called encephalitis (say: en-seff-uh-lie-tuss) or swelling of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord called meningitis (say men-in-ji-tuss). This can lead to permanent brain damage or death."
4154,What causes West nile virus disease?,"West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda in eastern Africa. It was first discovered in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York. Since then, the virus has spread throughout the United States.
The West Nile virus is a type of virus known as a flavivirus. Researchers believe West Nile virus is spread when a mosquito bites an infected bird and then bites a person.
Mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in the early fall, which is why the rate of the disease increases in late August to early September. The risk of disease decreases as the weather becomes colder and mosquitoes die off.
Although many people are bitten by mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus, most do not know they've been exposed. Few people develop severe disease or even notice any symptoms at all.
West Nile virus may also be spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. It is possible for an infected mother to spread the virus to her child through breast milk."
4155,Who is at highest risk for West nile virus ?,"Only a few mosquitoes carry West Nile Virus. For most people, the risk is low. Some people have a higher risk. People who are outside a lot have a greater chance of being bitten. People older than 50 are more likely to get very sick if they get West Nile Virus. People who already have health problems also have a greater risk."
4156,When to seek urgent medical care when I have West nile virus ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of West Nile virus infection, especially if you may have had contact with mosquitoes. If you are severely ill, go to an emergency room.
If you have been bitten by an infected mosquito, there is no treatment to avoid getting West Nile virus infection. People in good general health generally do not develop a serious illness, even if they are bitten by an infected mosquito."
4157,What to expect if I have West nile virus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In general, the outcome of a mild West Nile virus infection is excellent.
For patients with severe cases of West Nile virus infection, the outlook is more uncertain. West Nile encephalitis or meningitis may lead to brain damage and death. Approximately 10% of patients with brain inflammation do not survive."
4158,What are the symptoms of Whipworm infection ?,"Symptoms range from mild to severe. Sometimes, there are no symptoms. A severe infection may cause:
Bloody diarrhea Iron-deficiency anemia Fecal incontinence (during sleep) Rectal prolapse"
4159,What are the causes of Whipworm infection ?,"Whipworm infection is caused by the roundworm, Trichocephalus trichiura. It is a common infection that mainly affects children.
Children may become infected if they swallow soil contaminated with whipworm eggs. When the eggs hatch inside the body, the whipworm sticks inside the wall of the large intestine.
Whipworm is found throughout the world, especially in countries with warm, humid climates. Some outbreaks have been traced to contaminated vegetables (believed to be due to soil contamination)."
4160,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Whipworm infection ?,"Seek medical attention if you or your child develop bloody diarrhea. In addition to whipworm, there are many other infections and illnesses that can cause similar symptoms."
4161,What to expect if I have Whipworm infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Full recovery is expected with treatment.
4162,What are the symptoms of Wrist drop?,"The following symptoms may occur:
Abnormal sensations Hand or forearm (""back"" of the hand) ""Thumb side"" (radial surface) of the hand Fingers nearest to the thumb (2nd and 3rd fingers) Difficulty straightening the arm at the elbow Difficulty bending the hand back at the wrist, or even holding the hand Numbness, decreased sensation, tingling, or burning sensation Pain"
4163,What causes Wrist drop?,"Radial neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the radial nerve, which travels down the arm and controls movement of the triceps muscle at the back of the upper arm. It also controls the ability to bend the wrist backward and helps with the movement and sensation of the wrist and hand.
Mononeuropathy means a single nerve is damaged. With mononeuropathy, usually the nerve damage is caused locally. However, body-wide disorders may damage just one nerve.
Causes are:
Injury ""Crutch palsy,"" caused by improper use of crutches Fracture of the humerus (upper arm bone) Long-term or repeated constriction of the wrist (for example, from wearing a tight watch strap) Pressure caused by hanging the arm over the back of a chair (""Saturday night palsy"" if caused by drinking too much alcohol and falling asleep in that position) Pressure to the upper arm from arm positions during sleep or coma Pinching of the nerve during deep sleep, such as when a person is intoxicated Long-term pressure on the nerve, usually caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures
In some cases, no cause can be found.
If other nerves are also affected, the health care provider should look for a medical problem that can affect nerves. Medical conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease can damage nerves."
4164,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Wrist drop ?,"Call your health care provider if you have had an injury to the arm, and you develop numbness, tingling, or weakness."
4165,What to expect if I have Wrist drop  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be found and successfully treated, there is a good chance that you will fully recover. In some cases, there may be partial or complete loss of movement or sensation.
Nerve pain may be uncomfortable and may last for a long period of time. If this occurs, see a pain specialist to ensure you have access to all pain treatment options."
4166,What are the symptoms of Yaws?,"After 2 - 4 weeks of infection, the person develops a sore called a ""mother yaw"" where bacteria entered the skin. The sore is a growth that may be tan or reddish and looks like a raspberry. It is usually painless but does cause itching. These sores may last for months. More sores may appear shortly before or after the mother yaw heals as the person scratches or spreads the bacteria from the mother yaw to uninfected skin. Eventually the skin sores heal. Other symptoms include:
Bone pain Scarring of the skin Swelling of the bones and fingers
In the advanced stage, sores on the skin and bones can lead to severe disfigurement and disability. This occurs in up to 1 in 5 people who do not get antibiotic treatment."
4167,What causes Yaws?,"Yaws is an infection caused by the spiral-shaped bacteria, Treponema pallidum, subspecies pertenue. It is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis, but this disease is not sexually transmitted."
4168,Who is at highest risk for Yaws ?,"Yaws mainly affects children in rural, warm, tropical areas, such as the Caribbean Islands, Latin America, West Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Yaws is transmitted by direct contact with the skin sores of infected people."
4169,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Yaws ?,"Contact your health care provider if you or your child has sores on the skin or bone that don't go away, and you have stayed in tropical areas where yaws is known to occur."
4170,What to expect if I have Yaws  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If treated in its early stages, yaws can be cured. Skin lesions may take several months to heal. By its late stage, yaws may have already caused damage to the skin and bones. It may not be fully reversible, even with treatment."
4171,What are the symptoms of Yellow fever?,"Symptoms include:
Arrhythmias, heart dysfunction Bleeding (may progress to hemorrhage) Coma Decreased urination Delirium Fever Headache Jaundice Muscle aches (myalgia) Red eyes, face, tongue Seizures Vomiting Vomiting blood"
4172,What causes Yellow fever?,"Yellow fever is caused by a small virus that is spread by the bite of mosquitoes. This disease is common in South America and in sub-Saharan Africa.
Yellow fever has three stages:
Early stage: Headache, muscle and joint aches, fever, flushing, loss of appetite, vomiting, and jaundice are common. After approximately 3 - 4 days, often symptoms go away briefly (remission). Period of remission: After 3 - 4 days, fever and other symptoms go away. Most people will recover at this stage, but others may move onto the third, most dangerous stage (intoxication stage) within 24 hours. Period of intoxication: Multi-organ dysfunction occurs. This may include heart, liver, and kidney failure, bleeding disorders, hemorrhage, and brain dysfunction including delirium, seizures, coma, shock, and death."
4173,Who is at highest risk for Yellow fever ?,"Anyone can get yellow fever, but the elderly have a higher risk of severe infection. It is common in South America and in sub-Saharan Africa. If a person is bitten by an infected mosquito, symptoms usually develop 3 - 6 days later."
4174,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Yellow fever ?,"A person with advanced yellow fever may show signs of liver failure, renal failure, and shock. Tell your health care provider right away if you or your child develop fever, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or jaundice, especially if you have traveled to an area where yellow fever is known to occur. Blood tests can confirm the diagnosis."
4175,What to expect if I have Yellow fever  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Yellow fever varies in severity. Severe infections with internal bleeding and fever (hemorrhagic fever) are deadly in up to half of cases.
4176,What are the symptoms of Zygomycosis?,"Symptoms of rhinocerebral zygomycosis include:
Eye swelling and protrusion (proptosis) Dark nasal eschar (scabbing) Fever Headache Redness of skin overlying sinuses Sinus pain or congestion
Symptoms of lung (pulmonary) zygomycosis include:
Cough Coughing blood (occasionally) Fever Shortness of breath

Abdominal pain Vomiting blood
Symptoms of kidney (renal) zygomycosis include:
Fever Flank (side) pain
Symptoms of skin (cutaneous) zygomycosis include a single, painful, hardened area of skin that may have a blackened center."
4177,What causes Zygomycosis?,"Zygomycosis is caused by common fungi frequently found in the soil and in decaying vegetation. Most individuals are exposed to these fungi on a daily basis, but people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to infection.
Syndromes associated with zygomycosis include:
Rhinocerebral infection (infection of sinuses and brain) May start as a sinus infection May progress to involve inflammation of cranial nerves May cause blood clots that block vessels to the brain (thrombosis)
Pulmonary zygomycosis (lung involvement) -- pneumonia that gets worse quickly and may spread to the chest cavity, heart, and brain Zygomycosis of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and kidneys"
4178,Who is at highest risk for Zygomycosis ?,"Conditions most commonly associated with zygomycosis include diabetes (usually poorly controlled diabetes), chronic steroid use, metabolic acidosis, organ transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma, treatment with deferoxamine, and AIDS."
4179,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Zygomycosis ?,"People with weakened immune systems and immune disorders (including diabetes) should seek medical attention if they develop fever, headache, sinus pain, eye swelling, or any of the other symptoms listed above."
4180,What to expect if I have Zygomycosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Zygomycosis has an extremely high death rate even when aggressive surgery is done. Death rates range from 25 - 85% depending on the body area involved and your overall health.
4181,What are the symptoms of Adenitis?,"Swollen, tender, or hard lymph nodes Red, tender skin over lymph node
Lymph nodes may feel rubbery if an abscess has formed."
4182,What causes Adenitis?,"The lymph system is a network of lymph nodes, lymph ducts, lymph vessels, and organs that produce and move a fluid called lymph from tissues to the bloodstream. For more information on this part of the body, see lymph system.
The lymph glands, or nodes, are small structures that filter the lymph fluid. There are many white blood cells in the lymph nodes to help fight infection.
Lymphadenitis occurs when the glands become enlarged by swelling (inflammation), usually in response to bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The swollen glands are usually found near the site of an infection, tumor, or inflammation.
Lymphadenitis may occur after skin infections or other infections caused by bacteria such as streptococcus or staphylococcus. Sometimes it is caused by rare infections such as tuberculosis or cat scratch disease (Bartonella)."
4183,What to expect if I have Adenitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prompt treatment with antibiotics usually results in complete recovery, though it may take weeks, or even months, for swelling to disappear. The amount of time until recovery occurs will vary depending on the underlying cause."
4184,What are the symptoms of Adrenal carcinoma?,"Symptoms that suggest increased cortisol or other adrenal gland hormone production: Fatty, rounded hump high on the back just below the neck (buffalo hump) Flushed rounded face with pudgy cheeks (moon face) Obesity Stunted growth in height (short stature) Virilization - the appearance of male characteristics, including increased body hair (especially on the face), pubic hair, acne, deepening of voice, and enlarged clitoris (girls)
Symptoms that suggest increased aldosterone production are the same as symptoms of low potassium and include:
Increased thirst Muscle cramps Urination Weakness"
4185,What causes Adrenal carcinoma?,"Adrenocortical carcinoma is most common in children younger than 5 and adults in their 30s and 40s. Adrenocortical carcinoma may be linked to a cancer syndrome that is passed down through families (inherited). Both men and women can develop this tumor. Adrenocortical carcinoma can produce the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, or testosterone, as well as other hormones. In women, the tumor often releases these hormones, which can lead to male characteristics. The cause is unknown. About 2 people per million develop this type of tumor."
4186,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Adrenal carcinoma ?,"Call your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma, Cushing syndrome, or failure to grow."
4187,What to expect if I have Adrenal carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on how early the diagnosis is made and whether the tumor has spread (metastasized). Tumors that have spread usually lead to death within 1 to 3 years.
4188,What are the symptoms of Adrenal insufficiency?,"The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency usually begin gradually. Usual symptoms include:
Chronic, worsening fatigue Muscle weakness Loss of appetite Weight loss Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Hypotension Hypoglycemia Headache
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4189,Who is at highest risk for Adrenal insufficiency ?,Genetic defects of adrenal gland Underactive parathyroid glands Pernicious anemia Chronic fungal infections Chronic active hepatitis Diabetes Vitiligo Tuberculosis Amyloidosis AIDS -associated infections Cancer Surgical removal of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus
4190,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Adrenal insufficiency ?,"The urgent, severe worsening symptoms adrenal insufficiency is called an addisonian crisis or acute adrenal insufficiency. It is fetal and needs urgent medical care. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Sudden, penetrating pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs Severe vomiting and diarrhea Dehydration Hypotension Loss of consciousness"
4191,What to expect if I have Adrenal insufficiency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of adrenal insufficiency depends on:
Whether the patient has received hormone replacement or not. When stress happens on the patients with adrenal insufficiency, whether the treatment protocols are adjusted or not."
4192,What are the symptoms of Anorexia nervosa?,"To be diagnosed with anorexia, a person must:
Have an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even when she is underweight Refuse to keep weight at what is considered normal for her age and height (15% or more below the normal weight) Have a body image that is very distorted, be very focused on body weight or shape, and refuse to admit the seriousness of weight loss Have not had a period for three or more cycles (in women)
People with anorexia may severely limit the amount of food they eat, or eat and then make themselves throw up. Other behaviors include:
Cutting food into small pieces or moving them around the plate instead of eating Exercising all the time, even when the weather is bad, they are hurt, or their schedule is busy Going to the bathroom right after meals Refusing to eat around other people Using pills to make themselves urinate (water pills or diuretics), have a bowel movement (enemas and laxatives), or to decrease their appetite (diet pills)
Other symptoms of anorexia may include:
Blotchy or yellow skin that is dry and covered with fine hair Confused or slow thinking, along with poor memory or judgment Depression Dry mouth Extreme sensitivity to cold (wearing several layers of clothing to stay warm) Loss of bone strength Wasting away of muscle and loss of body fat"
4193,What causes Anorexia nervosa?,"The exact causes of anorexia nervosa are unknown. Many factors probably are involved. Genes and hormones may play a role. Social attitudes promoting very thin body types may also be involved. Family conflicts are no longer thought to contribute to this or other eating disorders. Anorexia usually begins during the teen years or young adulthood. It is more common in females, but may also be seen in males. The disorder is seen mainly in white women who are high academic achievers and who have a goal-oriented family or personality."
4194,Who is at highest risk for Anorexia nervosa ?,"Risk factors for anorexia include:
Trying to be perfect or overly focused on rules Being more worried about, or paying more attention to, weight and shape Having eating problems during infancy or early childhood Certain social or cultural ideas about health and beauty Having a negative self-image Having an anxiety disorder as a child"
4195,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anorexia nervosa ?,"Talk to your doctor if a loved one is:
Too focused on weight Over-exercising Limiting his or her food intake Very underweight
Getting medical help right away can make an eating disorder less severe."
4196,What to expect if I have Anorexia nervosa  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Anorexia nervosa is a serious condition that can be deadly. By some estimates, it leads to death in 10% of cases. Experienced treatment programs can help people with the condition return to a normal weight, but it is common for the disease to return.
Women who develop this eating disorder at an early age have a better chance of recovering completely. However, most people with anorexia will continue to prefer a lower body weight and be very focused on food and calories.
Weight management may be hard. Long-term treatment may be needed to stay at a healthy weight."
4197,What are the symptoms of Bartter syndrome?,"This disease usually occurs in childhood. Symptoms include:
Constipation Growth failure Increased frequency of urination Muscle cramping and weakness
Gitelman syndrome can present with similar symptoms."
4198,What causes Bartter syndrome?,"In some cases, Bartter syndrome may be genetic and the condition is present from before birth (congenital).
The condition is thought to be caused by a defect in the kidney's ability to reabsorb potassium. As a result, the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. This is also known as potassium wasting."
4199,Who is at highest risk for Bartter syndrome ?,Anyone with a family history of Bartter syndrome is at risk.
4200,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bartter syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if your child is:
Having muscle cramps Not growing well Urinating frequently"
4201,What to expect if I have Bartter syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The long-term outlook for patients with Bartter syndrome is not certain. Infants who have severe growth failure may grow normally with treatment. Although most patients remain well with ongoing treatment, some develop kidney failure."
4202,What are the symptoms of Carcinoid syndrome?,"Most carcinoid tumors have no symptoms. They only produce the syndrome about 10% of the time. When symptoms do occur, they may include:
Abdominal pain that comes and goes Bright red flushing of the face Diarrhea (may be explosive and severe) Heart palpitations Hypotension Wheezing
Sometimes symptoms are brought on by physical exertion, or eating or drinking things such as blue cheeses, chocolate, or red wine."
4203,What causes Carcinoid syndrome?,"Carcinoid syndrome is the pattern of symptoms sometimes seen in people with carcinoid tumors. These tumors are rare, and often slow growing. Carcinoid syndrome occurs only 10% of the time, usually after the tumor has spread to the liver or lung. These tumors release too much of the hormone serotonin, as well as several other chemicals that cause the blood vessels to open (dilate). More carcinoid tumors are being diagnosed today than in the past."
4204,Who is at highest risk for Carcinoid syndrome ?,"Carcinoid tumor (patient information)| Carcinoid tumors patients are at risk of carcinoid syndrome. Such patients are more likely to experience this syndrome if they have a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor, especially if it has metastasized i.e spread to the liver."
4205,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Carcinoid syndrome ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.
4206,What to expect if I have Carcinoid syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook in patients with carcinoid syndrome is different from the outlook in patients who have carcinoid tumors without the syndrome. In people with the syndrome, the tumor has usually spread to the liver, which lowers the survival rate. People with carcinoid syndrome are also more likely to have a separate cancer (second primary tumor) at the same time. The outlook is more favorable thanks to new treatment methods, such as Sandostatin.
Increased risk of falls and injury (from hypotension) Bowel obstruction (from tumor) Gastrointestinal bleeding Right-sided heart failure"
4207,What are the symptoms of Confusion?,"Confusion may come on quickly or slowly over time, depending on the cause. Many times, confusion is temporary. Other times it is permanent and not curable. It may be associated with delirium or dementia."

4209,Who is at highest risk for Confusion ?,"Confusion is more common in the elderly, and often occurs during a hospital stay.
Some confused people may have strange or unusual behavior or may act aggressively."
4210,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Confusion ?,"Call 911 if:
Confusion has come on suddenly or there are other symptoms such as: Cold or clammy skin Dizziness or feeling faint Fast pulse Fever Headache Slow or rapid breathing Uncontrolled shivering Confusion has come on suddenly in someone with diabetes. Confusion came on after a head injury. The person becomes unconscious at any time.
If you have been experiencing confusion, call for an appointment with your doctor."
4211,What are the symptoms of Congenital hypothyroidism?,"Some babies with congenital hypothyroidism do not appear any signs at birth.
Some may have one or more of the following symptoms:
Weight gain Puffy face Swollen tongue Hoarse cry Low muscle tone Cold intolerance Persistent constipation Fatigue and weakness Little to no growth Without therapy, the child later may show signs of neurological impairment."
4212,What causes Congenital hypothyroidism?,"Hypothyroidism in the newborn may be caused by:
A missing or abnormally developed thyroid gland Pituitary gland's failure to stimulate the thyroid Defective or abnormal formation of thyroid hormones
Incomplete development of the thyroid is the most common defect and occurs in about 1 out of every 3,000 births. Girls are affected twice as often than boys."
4213,Who is at highest risk for Cretinism ?,"Mutations in the DUOX2, PAX8, SLC5A5, TG, TPO, TSHB, and TSHR genes result in congenital hypothyroidism."
4214,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cretinism ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You feel your infant shows signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism You are pregnant and have been exposed to antithyroid drugs or procedures"
4215,What to expect if I have Cretinism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of congenital hypothyroidism depends on whether the baby starts thyroid hormone replacement therapy early.
The earlier the treatment begins, the better outcome the baby will be."
4216,What are the symptoms of Diabetic nephropathy?,"Early stage diabetic nephropathy has no symptoms. Over time, the kidney's ability to function starts to decline. Symptoms develop late in the disease and may include:
Fatigue Foamy appearance or excessive frothing of the urine Frequent hiccups General ill feeling Generalized itching Headache Nausea and vomiting Poor appetite Swelling of the legs Swelling around the eyes in the mornings; general body swelling may occur with late-stage disease Unintentional weight gain (from fluid buildup)"
4217,What causes Diabetic nephropathy?,"The exact cause of diabetic nephropathy is unknown, but it is believed that uncontrolled high blood sugar leads to the development of kidney damage, especially when hypertension is also present. In some cases, your genes or family history may also play a role. Not all persons with diabetes develop this condition. Each kidney is made of hundreds of thousands of filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron has a cluster of tiny blood vessels called a glomerulus. Together these structures help remove waste from the body. Too much blood sugar can damage these structures, causing them to thicken and become scarred. Slowly, over time, more and more blood vessels are destroyed. The kidney structures begin to leak and protein (albumin) begins to pass into the urine. Diabetic nephropathy generally goes along with other diabetes complications including hypertension, retinopathy, and blood vessel changes."
4218,Who is at highest risk for Diabetic nephropathy ?,"Persons with diabetes who have the following risk factors are more likely to develop this condition:
African American, Hispanic, or American Indian origin Family history of kidney disease or high blood pressure Poor control of blood pressure Poor control of blood sugar Type 1 diabetes before age 20 Smoking"
4219,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diabetic nephropathy ?,"Call your health care provider if you have diabetes and a routine urinalysis shows protein. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of diabetic nephropathy, or if new symptoms develop, including little or no urine output."
4220,What to expect if I have Diabetic nephropathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Nephropathy is a major cause of sickness and death in persons with diabetes. It is the leading cause of long-term kidney failure and end-stage kidney disease in the United States, and often leads to the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation. The condition slowly continues to get worse once large amounts of protein begin to appear in the urine or levels of creatinine in the blood begin to rise. Complications due to chronic kidney failure are more likely to occur earlier, and get worse more rapidly, when it is caused by diabetes than other causes. Even after dialysis or transplantation, persons with diabetes tend to do worse than those without diabetes."
4221,What are the symptoms of Diabetic retinopathy?,"Normal vision. Courtesy NIH National Eye Institute The same view with diabetic retinopathy.
Early diabetic retinopathy does not have any symptoms. With the devolpment, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Bleeding Blurred vision and gradual vision loss, and even blindness. Floaters Shadows or missing areas of vision Difficulty seeing at nighttime
Primary detachment of retina can present with similar symptoms."
4222,Who is at highest risk for Diabetic retinopathy ?,"All people with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes The longer the patient has diabetes, the more likely he/she will get diabetic retinopathy."
4223,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diabetic retinopathy ?,"If you have diabetes and you have not seen an ophthalmologist in the past year, you need to schedule and appointment for a check up. Additionally, call your doctor if any of the following symptoms are new or are becoming worse:
You cannot see well in dim light. You have blind spots.*You have double vision Your vision is blurry and you cannot focus. You have pain in one of your eyes. You are having headaches. You see spots floating in your eyes. You cannot see things on the side of your field of vision. You see shadows.
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only an ophthalmologist or physician can provide diagnosis. It is important to tell the doctor of these symptoms as soon as possible so that the problems can be treated as early as possible."
4224,What to expect if I have Diabetic retinopathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of diabetic retinopathy depends on:
Whether your blood sugar and blood pressure are controlled well. Whether your retinopathy is treated early"
4225,What are the symptoms of Galactosemia?,"Infants with galactosemia can develop symptoms in the first few days of life if they eat formula or breast milk that contains lactose. The symptoms may be due to a serious blood infection with the bacteria E. coli.
Convulsions Irritability Lethargy Poor feeding (baby refuses to eat formula containing milk) Poor weight gain Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Vomiting"
4226,Who is at highest risk for Galactosemia ?,"Galactosemia is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families.
It occurs in approximately 1 out of every 60,000 births among Caucasians. The rate is different for other groups.
There are three forms of the disease:
Galactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency (classic galactosemia, the most common and most severe form) Deficiency of galactose kinase Deficiency of galactose-6-phosphate epimerase
People with galactosemia are unable to fully break down the simple sugar galactose. Galactose makes up half of lactose, the sugar found in milk. The other sugar is glucose.
If an infant with galactosemia is given milk, substances made from galactose build up in the infant's system. These substances damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes.
Persons with galactosemia cannot tolerate any form of milk (human or animal). They must be careful about eating other foods containing galactose."
4227,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Galactosemia ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Your infant has a combination of galactosemia symptoms You have a family history of galactosemia and are considering having children"
4228,What to expect if I have Galactosemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People who get an early diagnosis and strictly avoid milk products can live a relatively normal life. However, mild intellectual impairment may develop, even in people who avoid galactose."
4229,What are the symptoms of Gestational diabetes?,"Usually there are no symptoms, or the symptoms are mild and not life threatening to the pregnant woman. Often, the blood sugar (glucose) level returns to normal after delivery.
Symptoms may include:
Blurred vision Fatigue Frequent infection s, including those of the bladder, vagina, and skin Increased thirst Increased urination Nausea and vomiting Weight loss in spite of increased appetite"
4230,What causes Gestational diabetes?,"Pregnancy hormones can block insulin from doing its job. When this happens, glucose levels may increase in a pregnant woman's blood."
4231,Who is at highest risk for Gestational diabetes ?,"You are at greater risk for gestational diabetes if you:
Are older than 25 when you are pregnant Have a family history of diabetes Gave birth to a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds or had a birth defect Have sugar (glucose) in your urine when you see your doctor for a regular prenatal visit Have high blood pressure Have too much amniotic fluid Have had an unexplained miscarriage or stillbirth Were overweight before your pregnancy"
4232,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gestational diabetes ?,Call your health care provider if you are pregnant and you have symptoms of diabetes.
4233,What to expect if I have Gestational diabetes  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most women with gestational diabetes are able to control their blood sugar and avoid harm to themselves or their baby.
Pregnant women with gestational diabetes tend to have larger babies at birth. This can increase the chance of problems at the time of delivery, including:
Birth injury (trauma) because of the baby's large size Delivery by c-section
Your baby is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the first few days of life.
Mothers with gestational diabetes have an increased risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy.
There is a slightly increased risk of the baby dying when the mother has untreated gestational diabetes. Controlling blood sugar levels reduces this risk.
High blood sugar (glucose) levels often go back to normal after delivery. However, women with gestational diabetes should be watched closely after giving birth and at regular doctor's appointments to screen for signs of diabetes. Many women with gestational diabetes develop diabetes within 5 - 10 years after delivery. The risk may be increased in obese women."
4234,What are the symptoms of Von Gierke disease?,"Constant hunger and need to eat often Easy bruising and nosebleeds Fatigue Irritability Puffy cheeks, thin chest and limbs, and swollen belly"
4235,What causes Von Gierke disease?,"Von Gierke disease occurs when the body lacks the protein (enzyme) that releases glucose from glycogen. This causes abnormal amounts of glycogen to build up in certain tissues. When glycogen is not broken down properly, it leads to low blood sugar.
Von Gierke disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry the defective gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% chance of developing the disease."
4236,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Glycogen storage disease type I ?,Call your health care provider if you have a family history of glycogen storage disease or early infant death due to low blood sugar.
4237,What to expect if I have Glycogen storage disease type I  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Since treatments have been developed, growth, puberty, and quality of life have improved for people with von Gierke disease. Those who are identified and carefully treated at a young age can live into adulthood.

Early treatment also decreases the rate of severe problems such as:
Life-threatening low blood sugar Liver tumors Muscle weakness Heart abnormalities"
4250,What are the symptoms of Goiter?,"The main symptom is a swollen thyroid gland. The size may range from a single small nodule to a large neck lump.
The swollen thyroid can put pressure on the windpipe and esophagus, which can lead to:
Breathing difficulties (may rarely occur with very large goiters) Cough Hoarseness Swallowing difficulties
There may be neck vein swelling and dizziness when the arms are raised above the head."
4251,What causes Goiter?,"There are different kinds of goiters. A simple goiter can occur for no known reason, or when the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs. The thyroid gland makes up for this by becoming larger.
There are two types of simple goiter:
Endemic (colloid) goiter Sporadic (nontoxic) goiter
Colloid goiters occur in groups of people who live in areas with iodine-poor soil. These regions are usually away from the sea coast. People in these communities might not get enough iodine in their diet (iodine is needed to produce thyroid hormone).
The use of iodized table salt in the United States today prevents iodine deficiency. However, the Great Lakes, Midwest, and inner mountain areas of the United States were once called the ""goiter belt,"" because a high number of goiter cases occurred there. A lack of enough iodine is still common in central Asia, the Andes region of South America, and central Africa.
In most cases of sporadic goiter the cause is unknown. Occasionally, certain medications such as lithium or aminoglutethimide can cause a nontoxic goiter."
4252,Who is at highest risk for Goiter ?,"Inherited factors may cause goiters. Risk factors include:
Age over 40 years Family history of goiter Female gender Not getting enough iodine in the diet"
4253,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Goiter ?,Call your health care provider if you experience any swelling in the front of your neck or any other symptoms of goiter.
4254,What to expect if I have Goiter  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A simple goiter may disappear on its own, or may become large. Over time, destruction to the thyroid may cause the gland to stop making enough thyroid hormone. This condition is called hypothyroidism.
Occasionally, a goiter may become toxic and produce thyroid hormone on its own. This can cause high levels of thyroid hormone, a condition called hyperthyroidism."
4255,What are the symptoms of Gynecomastia?,Breast enlargement Breast pain
4256,What causes Gynecomastia?,"All men have both androgens and estrogens in fix levels. Androgens are hormones that create male characteristics, such as hair growth, muscle size, and a deep voice. Estrogens are hormones that create female characteristics. Changes in the levels of these hormones, or in how the body uses or responds to these hormones can cause enlarged breasts in men.
Infancy Puberty Aging Chronic liver disease Exposure to anabolic steroid hormones Exposure to estrogen (female hormone) Kidney failure and dialysis Lack (deficiency) of testosterone (male hormone) Marijuana use Hormone treatment for prostate cancer Radiation treatment of the testicles Side effects of some medications (ketoconazole, spironolactone, cimetidine etc) Overactive thyroid
Genetic defects Tumors

4257,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gynecomastia ?,"Call your health care provider if: You have recent swelling, pain, or enlargement in one or both breasts. There is dark or bloody discharge from the nipples. There is a skin sore or ulcer over the breast. A breast lump feels hard or firm."
4258,What are the symptoms of Hyperaldosteronism?,Fatigue Headache Hypertension Intermittent paralysis Muscle weakness Numbness
4259,What are the causes of Hyperaldosteronism?,"Persons with primary hyperaldosteronism have a problem with the adrenal gland that causes it to release too much aldosterone. In secondary hyperaldosteronism, the excess aldosterone is caused by something outside the adrenal gland that mimics the primary condition. Primary hyperaldosteronism used to be considered a rare condition, but some experts believe that it may be the cause of hypertension in some patients. Most cases of primary hyperaldosteronism are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the adrenal gland. Secondary hyperaldosteronism is generally related to hypertension. It is also related to disorders such as:
Cirrhosis of the liver Heart failure Nephrotic syndrome"
4260,Who is at highest risk for Hyperaldosteronism ?,The condition is common in people ages 30 - 50.
4261,What are the symptoms of Hyperandrogenism?,"Hyperandrogenism:
Acne Amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) Changes in female body contours Decrease in breast size Increase in body hair in a male pattern (hirsutism) such as on the face, chin, and abdomen Oily skin
Virilization:
Clitoromegaly (enlargement of the clitoris) Deepening of the voice Increase in muscle mass Temporal balding (thinning hair and hair loss)"
4262,What causes Hyperandrogenism?,"In healthy women, the ovaries and adrenal glands produce about 40 - 50% of the body's testosterone. Both tumors of the ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can cause excess androgen production.
Cushing's disease, an abnormality in the pituitary gland, causes excess amounts of corticosteroids, which cause masculine body changes in women. Also, tumors in the adrenal glands can cause overproduction of androgens and lead to male body characteristics in women."
4263,What to expect if I have Hyperandrogenism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The success of the treatment depends on what caused the excess androgen production.
If the condition is caused by an ovarian tumor, surgical removal of the tumor may correct the problem. Most ovarian tumors are not cancerous (benign), and will not come back after they've been removed.
In polycystic ovary syndrome, the following can reduce symptoms caused by increased androgen levels:
Careful monitoring Dietary changes Medications Regular vigorous exercise"
4264,What are the symptoms of Hyperkalemia?,"Hyperkalemia often has no symptoms. Occasionally, people may have the following symptoms:
Irregular heartbeat Nausea Slow, weak, or absent pulse"
4265,What causes Hyperkalemia?,"Potassium is involved in regulating muscle tissue, and is part of digestion, metabolism, and homeostasis (maintaining a balance between the many electrical and chemical processes of the body).
Hyperkalemia occurs when the level of potassium in the bloodstream is higher than normal. This may be related to an increase in total body potassium or the excess release of potassium from the cells into the bloodstream.
The kidneys normally remove excess potassium from the body. Most cases of hyperkalemia are caused by disorders that reduce the kidneys' ability to get rid of potassium.This may result from disorders such as:
Acute kidney failure Chronic kidney failure Glomerulonephritis Obstructive uropathy Rejection of a kidney transplant
The hormone aldosterone regulates kidney removal of sodium and potassium. Lack of aldosterone can result in hyperkalemia with an increase in total body potassium. Addison's disease is one disorder that causes reduced aldosterone production.
Any time potassium is released from the cells, it may build up in the fluid outside the cells and in the bloodstream. Acidosis leads to the movement of potassium from inside the cells to the fluid outside the cells. Tissue injury can cause the cells to release potassium. Such injury includes:
Burns Disorders that cause blood cells to burst (hemolytic conditions) Gastrointestinal bleeding Rhabdomyolysis from drugs, alcoholism, coma, or certain infections Surgery Traumatic injury Tumors
If the kidney is working properly, and there is enough aldosterone, tissue trauma alone rarely leads to hyperkalemia. A normally functioning kidney will remove the excess potassium that has been released from the cells.
Increased intake of potassium can cause hyperkalemia if kidney function is poor. Salt substitutes often contain potassium, as do many ""low-salt"" packaged foods.
Hyperkalemia may be caused by medications, including medications that affect kidney function (potassium sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone, amiloride, or triamterene) and potassium supplements (especially intravenous potassium)."

4267,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperkalemia ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of hyperkalemia. Emergency symptoms include:
Absent or weak heartbeat Changes in breathing pattern Loss of consciousness Nausea Weakness"
4268,What to expect if I have Hyperkalemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome with this condition varies. In some people, the disorder causes deadly complications, while others tolerate it well."
4269,Who is at highest risk for Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ?,"Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes who have decreased access to fluids or any condition that limits fluid intake or during an illness such as pneumonia, heart attack, stroke or pregnancy are at highest risk for the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. This condition has also been seen in type 1 diabetes, children, and young adults, but less common."

4278,What causes Hypoglycemia?,"Hypoglycemia occurs when:
Your body's sugar (glucose) is used up too quickly Glucose is released into the bloodstream too slowly Too much insulin is released into the bloodstream
Insulin is a hormone that reduces blood sugar. It is produced by the pancreas in response to increased glucose levels in the blood.
Hypoglycemia is relatively common in persons with diabetes. It occurs when
You take too much insulin or diabetes medicine You don't eat enough food You suddenly increase your exercise without increasing the amount of food you eat
Relative hypoglycemia is a fairly common condition in which a newborn's blood sugar is low. Babies born to mothers with diabetes may have severe hypoglycemia.
Idiopathic hypoglycemia is hypoglycemia that occurs without a known cause. People with this type of hypoglycemia do not have diabetes.
Hypoglycemia may also be caused by:
Ingestion of alcohol Insulin-secreting tumor of the pancreas Liver disease"
4279,Who is at highest risk for Hypoglycemia ?,Hypoglycemia is relatively common in persons with diabetes.
4280,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypoglycemia ?,"Go to the emergency room immediately or call a local emergency number (such as 911) if early signs of hypoglycemia do not improve after you've eaten a snack containing sugar.
Get immediate medical help if a person with diabetes or a history of hypoglycemia loses alertness or if you can't wake them up."

4293,What are the symptoms of Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"You may have intense or uncontrollable thirst, and crave ice water. You will produce large amounts of urine, usually more than 3 - 15 liters per day.
If you do not drink enough fluids, dehydration can result. Symptoms may include:
Dry mucous membranes Dry skin Sunken appearance to eyes Sunken fontanelles (soft spot) in infants
Other symptoms that can occur due to inadequate fluids include:
Fatigue, lethargy Headache Irritability Low body temperature Muscle pains Rapid heart rate Weight loss"
4294,What causes Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney tubules do not respond to a chemical in the body called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin. ADH normally tells the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated.
As a result of the defect, the kidneys release an excessive amount of water into the urine, producing a large quantity of very dilute urine. This makes you produce large amounts of urine."
4295,Who is at highest risk for Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ?,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is rare. Congenital diabetes insipidus is present at birth as a result of an inherited defect that usually affects men, although women can pass the gene on to their children.
Most commonly, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus develops because of other reasons. This is called an acquired disorder. Factors that can trigger the acquired form of this condition include:
Blockage in the urinary tract High calcium levels Low potassium levels Use of certain drugs (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin B)"
4296,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
4297,What to expect if I have Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If a person drinks enough fluids, this condition has no significant effects on the fluid or electrolyte balance of the body.
If the person does not drink enough fluids, high urine output may cause dehydration and high levels of sodium in the blood.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that is present at birth is a chronic condition requiring lifelong treatment."
4298,What are the symptoms of Neuroendocrine tumors?,"Symptoms depend on which hormone is made by the tumor.
For example, insulinomas produce insulin, which helps the body lower blood sugar levels. Symptoms may include: Feeling tired or weak Shaking or sweating Headache Hunger Nervousness, anxiety, or feeling irritable Unclear thinking or feeling uneasy Double or blurry vision Fast or pounding heartbeat
If your blood sugar gets too low, you may faint, have a seizure, or even go into a coma.
Gastrinomas make the hormone gastrin, which tells the body to make stomach acid. Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Diarrhea Ulcers in the stomach and small bowel Vomiting blood (occasionally)
Glucagonomas make the hormone glucagon, which helps the body raise blood sugar levels. Symptoms can include: Diabetes Red, blistery rash in the groin or buttocks Weight loss"
4299,What causes Neuroendocrine tumors?,"In the normal pancreas, cells called islet cells produce hormones that regulate a variety of bodily functions, such as blood sugar level and the production of stomach acid.
Tumors that arise from islet cells of the pancreas can also produce a variety of hormones, though some do not.
Although islet cells produce many different hormones, most tumors release only one hormone that leads to specific symptoms. Pancreatic islet cell tumors can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).
Islet cell tumors include:
Gastrinomas (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) Glucagonomas Insulinomas"
4300,Who is at highest risk for Neuroendocrine tumors ?,"A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I (MEN I) is a risk factor for islet cell tumors."
4301,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neuroendocrine tumors ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of these tumors, especially if you have a family history of MEN I."
4302,What to expect if I have Neuroendocrine tumors  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"You may be cured if the tumors are surgically removed before they have spread to other organs. If tumors are cancerous, chemotherapy may be used, but it usually cannot cure patients.
Life-threatening problems (such as very low blood sugar) can occur due to excess hormone production, or if the cancer spreads throughout the body."
4303,What are the symptoms of osteoporosis?,"There are no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Symptoms occurring late in the disease include:
Bone pain or tenderness Fractures with little or no trauma Loss of height (as much as 6 inches) over time Low back pain due to fractures of the spinal bones Neck pain due to fractures of the spinal bones Stooped posture or kyphosis, also called a ""dowager's hump"""
4304,What causes osteoporosis?,"Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease. Researchers estimate that about 1 out of 5 American women over the age of 50 have osteoporosis. About half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebra (bones of the spine). Osteoporosis occurs when the body fails to form enough new bone, when too much old bone is reabsorbed by the body or both.
Calcium and phosphate are two minerals that are essential for normal bone formation. Throughout youth, your body uses these minerals to produce bones. If you do not get enough calcium, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium from the diet, bone production and bone tissues may suffer.
As you age, calcium and phosphate may be reabsorbed back into the body from the bones, which makes the bone tissue weaker. This can result in brittle, fragile bones that are more prone to fractures, even without injury. Usually, the loss occurs gradually over years. Many times, a person will have a fracture before becoming aware that the disease is present. By the time a fracture occurs, the disease is in its advanced stages and damage is severe. The leading causes of osteoporosis are a drop in estrogen in women at the time of menopause and a drop in testosterone in men. Women over age 50 and men over age 70 have a higher risk for osteoporosis.
Other causes include: Being confined to a bed Chronic rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, eating disorders Taking corticosteroid medications (prednisone, methylprednisolone) every day for more than 3 months, or taking some antiseizure drugs Hyperparathyroidism Vitamin D deficiency"
4305,Who is at highest risk for Osteoporosis ?,"White women, especially those with a family history of osteoporosis, have a greater than average risk of developing osteoporosis. Other risk factors include:
Absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) for long periods of time Drinking a large amount of alcohol Family history of osteoporosis History of hormone treatment for prostate cancer or breast cancer Low body weight Smoking Too little calcium in the diet"
4306,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Osteoporosis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of osteoporosis or if you wish to be screened for the condition.
4307,What to expect if I have Osteoporosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Medications to treat osteoporosis can help prevent fractures, but vertebrae that have already collapsed cannot be reversed. Some persons with osteoporosis become severely disabled as a result of weakened bones. Hip fractures leave about half of the patients unable to walk independently. This is one of the major reasons people are admitted to nursing homes. Although osteoporosis is debilitating, it does not affect life expectancy."
4308,What are the symptoms of Pheochromocytoma?,"Abdominal pain Chest pain Irritability Nervousness Pallor Palpitations Rapid heart rate Severe headache Sweating Weight loss
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Hand tremor High blood pressure Sleeping difficulty
Symptom attacks may occur at unpredictable intervals and usually last 15 to 20 minutes. The attacks may increase in frequency, length, and severity as the tumor grows."
4309,What causes Pheochromocytoma?,"Pheochromocytoma may occur as a single tumor or as more than one growth. It usually develops in the center (medulla) of one or both adrenal glands. Rarely, this kind of tumor occurs outside the adrenal gland, usually somewhere else in the abdomen.
Very few pheochromocytomas are cancerous.
The tumors may occur at any age, but they are most common from early to mid-adulthood."
4310,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pheochromocytoma ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of pheochromocytoma You had a pheochromocytoma in the past and your symptoms return"
4311,What to expect if I have Pheochromocytoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most patients who have noncancerous tumors that are removed with surgery are still alive after 5 years. The tumors come back in less than 10% of these patients. Levels of the hormones norepinephrine and epinephrine return to normal after surgery.
4312,What are the symptoms of Pituitary adenoma?,"Most pituitary tumors produce too much of one or more hormones. As a result, symptoms of one or more of the following conditions can occur:
Hyperthyroidism Cushing syndrome Gigantism or acromegaly Nipple discharge
Symptoms caused by pressure from a larger pituitary tumor may include:
Headache Lethargy Nasal discharge Nausea and vomiting Problems with the sense of smell Visual changes Double vision Drooping eyelids Visual field deficit
Rarely, these symptoms may occur suddenly and can be severe."
4313,What causes Pituitary adenoma?,"The causes of pituitary adenomas are unknown. However, some are part of a hereditary disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN I)."
4314,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pituitary adenoma ?,Call your health care provider if you develop any symptoms of a pituitary tumor.
4315,What to expect if I have Pituitary adenoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If the tumor can be surgically removed, the outlook is fair to good, depending upon whether the entire tumor is removed."
4316,What are the symptoms of Precocious puberty?,"Before 8 or 9 yeays old, girls and boys with precocious puberty show signs of secondary sex characteristics.
Girls
First period (menstruation) Mature outer genitals Rapid height growth Breasts develpment Armpit or pubic hair
Boys
Growth of the testes and penis Armpit or pubic hair, and facial hair, often first on the upper lip Muscle growth, rapid height growth Voice deepening"
4317,Who is at highest risk for Precocious puberty ?,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Disorders of the testicles, ovaries, or adrenal glands Hypothalamic hamartoma McCune-Albright syndrome Tumors that release a hormone called hCG"
4318,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Precocious puberty ?,"If your child has any signs and symptoms of precocious puberty, call your health care provider to identify the cause of the disease."
4319,What to expect if I have Precocious puberty  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis in patients with precocious puberty depends on the cause.
4320,What are the symptoms of Primary amenorrhea?,A female with amenorrhea will have no menstrual flow with or without other signs of puberty.
4321,What causes Primary amenorrhea?,"Hormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle. Hormone problems can occur when:
Changes occur to the parts of the brain where hormones that help manage the menstrual cycle are produced The ovaries are not working correctly
These problems may be due to:
Genetic defects Infections that occur in the womb or after birth Other birth defects Tumors
In many cases, the cause of primary amenorrhea is not known.
Conditions associated with primary amenorrhea include:
Adrenogenital syndrome Anorexia nervosa Chromosomal abnormalities such as Turner syndrome or Sawyer syndrome Congenital heart disease (cyanotic) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Craniopharyngioma Chronic (long-term) illnesses Cushing's disease Cystic fibrosis Gonadal dysgenesis Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism Hyperprolactinemia Obesity Prader-Willi syndrome Polycystic ovarian disease Testicular feminization True hermaphroditism Tumors of the pituitary or adrenal glands Tumors of the ovaries"
4322,Who is at highest risk for Primary amenorrhea ?,"Most girls begin menstruating between ages 9 and 18, with an average around 12 years old. Primary amenorrhea typically occurs when a girl is older than 15, if she has undergone other normal changes that occur during puberty. Primary amenorrhea may occur with or without other signs of puberty.
Being born with poorly formed genital or pelvic organs (missing uterus or vagina, vaginal septum, cervical stenosis, or imperforate hymen) can lead to primary amenorrhea."
4323,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Primary amenorrhea ?,"Call your health provider if your daughter is older than age 16 and has not yet begun menstruating, or if she is 14 and shows no other signs of puberty."
4324,What to expect if I have Primary amenorrhea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Overall the outlook is good, depending on the cause of the amenorrhea. If the amenorrhea is caused by one of the following conditions, there is a good chance that it can be corrected with medication, lifestyle changes, or surgery:
Adrenogenital syndrome Chronic illness Congenital heart disease Drastic weight reduction Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism Imperforate hymen or vaginal septum Malnutrition Normal delay of onset (up to age 14 or 15) Obesity Overactive thyroid
Periods are unlikely to start on their own if the amenorrhea was caused by one of the following conditions:
Congenital abnormalities of the upper genital system Craniopharyngioma Cystic fibrosis Gonadal dysgenesis Prader-Willi syndrome Testicular feminization syndrome True hermaphroditism Turner syndrome (XO)
If the amenorrhea cannot be corrected, it is sometimes possible to create a menstrual-like situation (pseudomenstruation) with medications. Medicines can help you feel more like your friends or family, and will also protect the bones from becoming too thin (osteoporosis)."
4325,What are the symptoms of Prolactinoma?,"Early prolactinoma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Abnormal milk flow from the breast in a woman who is not pregnant or nursing Breast tenderness in women Stopping of menstruation not related to menopause Decreased sexual interest Headache Infertility Vision changes
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Diseases with similar symptoms are:
Pituitary tumors that do not release prolactin Hypothalamus tumor"
4326,What causes Prolactinoma?,"Although research continues to unravel the mysteries of disordered cell growth, the cause of pituitary tumors remains unknown. It has been shown that stress can significantly raise prolactin levels which should make stress a diagnostic differential though it usually is not considered such. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic--they are not genetically passed from parents to offspring. The majority of moderately raised prolactin levels (up to 5000mIU/L) are not due to microprolactinomas but other causes. The effects of some prescription drugs are the most common, but the normal physiological causes of pregnancy & breastfeeding should not be forgotten, nor the effects of other pituitary tumours. This is discussed more under Hyperprolactinaemia."
4327,Who is at highest risk for Prolactinoma ?,"Prolactinoma is the most common type of pituitary tumor (adenoma). It makes up at least 30% of all pituitary adenomas. Most pituitary tumors are noncancerous (benign). Prolactinoma may occur as part of a hereditary disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) Prolactinomas occur most commonly in people under age 40. They are about five times more common in women than men, but are rare in children. At least half of all prolactinomas are very small (less than 1 cm or 3/8 of an inch in diameter). These microprolactinomas are more common in women. Many small tumors remain small and never get larger. Larger tumors, called macroprolactinomas, are more common in men. Prolactinomas in men tend to occur at an older age and can grow to a large size before any symptoms appear."
4328,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Prolactinoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of prolactinoma develop. If you have had a prolactinoma in the past, call your health care provider if the symptoms return."
4329,What to expect if I have Prolactinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of prolactinoma depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The patient’s general health Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
4330,What are the symptoms of Hyperthyroidism?,"Symptoms of hyperthyroidism vary from person to person. Usual signs include the following:
Goiter Increased appetite, but weight loss Palpitation Hypertension Increased sensitivity to heat and perspiration Nervousness, anxiety or irritability, difficulty sleeping Hand tremors Fatigue, muscle weakness Changes in menstrual patterns (usually lighter flow, less frequent periods) in women
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4331,Who is at highest risk for  hyperthyroidism?,Graves’ disease Thyroid nodules Thyroiditis Too much iodine ingestion Over-medicating with synthetic thyroid hormone
4332,When to seek urgent medical care when I have  hyperthyroidism?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of hyperthyroidism develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Palpitation Severe hypertension"
4333,What to expect if I have  hyperthyroidism (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Many cases of hyperthyroidism are generally treatable. Prognosis depends on whether or not the patient has severe complications.
4334,What are the symptoms of Secondary amenorrhea?,"No menstrual period for 6 months or longer Previously had one or more menstrual periods that started on their own
Other symptoms that can occur with secondary amenorrhea include:
Breast size changes Considerable weight gain or weight loss Discharge from the breast (galactorrhea) Headache Increased hair growth in a ""male"" pattern (hirsutism) and acne Vaginal dryness Voice changes
If amenorrhea is caused by a pituitary tumor, there may be other symptoms related to the tumor, such as vision loss."
4335,What causes Secondary amenorrhea?,"Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or in menopause are not considered to have secondary amenorrhea.
Women who are taking birth control pills or receive hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding. When they stop taking these hormones, their periods may not return for more than 6 months.
You are more likely to have amenorrhea if you:
Are obese Exercise excessively and for long periods of time Have less than 15% - 17% body fat Have severe anxiety or emotional distress Lose a lot of weight suddenly (for example, with a strict diet or after gastric bypass surgery)
Other causes include:
Brain (pituitary) tumors Polycystic ovarian syndrome Premature ovarian failure Thyroid dysfunction
The following drugs may also cause missed periods:
Busulfan Chemotherapy drugs for cancer Chlorambucil Cyclophosphamide Phenothiazines"
4336,Who is at highest risk for Secondary amenorrhea ?,Procedures such as a dilation and curettage (D and C) can lead to scar tissue formation that may cause a woman to stop menstruating. This is called Asherman syndrome. Scarring may also be caused by some severe pelvic infections.
4337,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Secondary amenorrhea ?,"Call for an appointment with your primary health care provider or OB/GYN provider if you have missed more than one period so that you can get diagnosed and treated, if necessary."
4338,What to expect if I have Secondary amenorrhea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outlook depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Most of the conditions that cause secondary amenorrhea will respond to treatment.
4339,What are the symptoms of SIADH?,"Symptoms vary, depending on the degree of abnormality in the serum sodium concentration and the speed with which this concentration falls. Usual symptoms include:
Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Fatigue and weakness Irritability Personality changes, such as combativeness Seizures Confusion Hallucinations Stupor Coma
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4340,What causes SIADH?,"The causes of SIADH are many, and because the disease may present with features of electrolyte disturbances, there are many non-associated diseases that present like SIADH. The most common cause of SIADH is ectopic secretion of the antidiuretic hormone (also called arginine vasopressin) by cancer cells. Cancers like lung or bronchogenic cancers, lymphoma (s) in any location, head and neck cancers, sarcoma, and myriad of other cancers can cause SIADH. Other causes of SIADH include: Pulmonary diseases, central nervous system disorders, as well as pharmacotherapy with anticancer drugs like vincristine, cyclophosphamide; opioids like morphin, antiepileptics, and some antidepressants medications."
4341,Who is at highest risk for Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ?,"Central nervous system disease: Brain tumors, trauma, infection such as meningitis and encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, delirium tremens, multiple sclerosis Pulmonary disease: Small cell lung cancer, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung abscess, tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, positive-pressure ventilation Cancer: Lung cancer, pancreas cancer, thymoma, ovarian cancer, lymphoma, laryngeal cancer, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma. Drugs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nicotine, diuretics, chlorpropamide, carbamazepine, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, vincristine, thioridazine, cyclophosphamide, clofibrate, bromocriptine, haloperidol, thiothixene, exogenous oxytocin. Surgery: Damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland during or after surgery Idiopathic"
4342,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ?,"Depending on the degree of the dilution hyponatremia, presentation of SIADH varies. It can be asymptomatic, or present with features of mild hyponatremia, such as: Fatigue Vomiting Malaise Anorexia Headache It may progress to worsening or altered mental status, seizures, delirium, or coma in severe hyponatremia. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone may be a clinical condition of diseases, such as cancers, drugs, and pulmonary diseases. When you have the diseases mentioned above, seek urgent medical care as soon as possible if you experience either of the following symptoms: Dehydration Consciousness disorders Confusion Hallucinations Stupor Coma"
4343,What to expect if I have Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of SIADH depends on the severity of the disease and the promptness of treatment. Prognosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) also depends largely on its cause. If the cause is drugs, SIADH usually improves after stopping a drug. If SIADH is associated with some infection, treating the infection may be important. For those SIADH with cancers, the outcomes may be poor."
4344,What causes weight gain?,"Unintentional weight gain can be caused by many different things.
As you age, our metabolism slows down. This can cause weight gain if you eat too much, eat the wrong foods, or do not get enough exercise.
A medical problem or use of certain medication may also make you gain weight.
Medications that can cause weight gain include corticosteroids and drugs used to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression.
Hormone changes can also cause unintentional weight gain. This may be due to:
Cushing syndrome Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid, or low thyroid) Polycystic ovary syndrome Menopause
Bloating, or swelling due to a buildup of fluid in the tissues can cause weight gain. This may occur with menstruation, heart or kidney failure, preeclampsia, or certain medications.
If you quit smoking, you might gain weight. Most people who quit smoking gain 4 - 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting. Some gain as much as 25 - 30 pounds. This weight gain is not simply due to eating more."
4345,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Weight gain ?,"Contact your health care provider if the following symptoms occur along with the weight gain:
Constipation Excessive weight gain without a known cause Hair loss Sensitivity to cold Swollen feet and shortness of breath Uncontrollable hunger accompanied by palpitations, tremor, and sweating Vision changes"
4346,What to expect if I have Weight gain  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Your health care provider will perform a physical examination, measure your height and weight to calculate your body mass index (BMI), and ask questions about your weight gain, such as:
Are you anxious, depressed, or under stress ? Did you gain the weight quickly or slowly? Do you have a history of depression ? Do you use alcohol or street drugs?
Does the weight gain cause you much concern? Has your participation in social activities decreased? Has your physical activity been restricted due to illness or injury? Have there been changes in your diet or appetite?
How much weight have you gained?
What medications do you take? What other symptoms do you have? When did the weight gain begin?
Tests that may be done include:
Blood tests including chemistry profile Measurement of hormone levels Nutritional assessment
Weight gain caused by emotional problems may require psychological counseling. Talk to your health care provider about an appropriate diet and exercise program and realistic weight loss goals. If weight gain is caused by a physical illness, treatment (if there is any) for the underlying cause will be prescribed.
If weight continues to be a problem despite diet and exercise, talk with your health care provider about other treatment options, including medications and surgery."
4347,What are the symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome?,"Usual syptoms include:
Burning sensation in the abdomen Nausea and vomiting Weight loss Diarrhea
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4348,Who is at highest risk for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome ?,The most potent risk factor in the development of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Other risk factors include alcohol abuse.
4349,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe burning sensation in the abdomen or heartburn Severe nausea, vomiting or diarrhea"
4350,What to expect if I have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome for patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome largely depends on the nature and extent of the disease.
4351,What are the symptoms of abdominal distension?,Passing an excessive amount of gas or burping too frequently. Abdominal bloating Cramping abdominal pain Feeling of fullness in the stomach Diarrhea Constipation Pre-menstrual or menstrual discomfort
4352,What causes abdominal distension?,"Air swallowing (a nervous habit) Constipation Gastroesophageal reflux Irritable bowel syndrome Lactose intolerance and other food intolerances Overeating Small bowel bacterial overgrowth Weight gain
More serious causes of abdominal distension or bloating are:
Ascites which is fluid that accumulates in the belly. Tumors Celiac disease, which is a condition caused by an allergy to a component of food called gluten. Dumping syndrome, which is a syndrome causing gastrointestinal side effects due to a tumor. Ovarian cancer When the pancreas is not able to make enzymes needed for digestion (pancreatic insufficiency)"
4353,Who is at highest risk for Abdominal distension ?,Female gender High body mass index or high BMI
4354,What are the symptoms of Abdominal mass?,"An abdominal mass is usually found during a routine physical examination, as it develops slowly.
The abdomen is divided into four quadrants:
Right-upper quadrant Left-upper quadrant Right-lower quadrant Left-lower quadrant
The location of the pain, firmness, texture of the mass helps the physician diagnose the cause.
Other terms used to find the location of abdominal pain or masses include:
Epigastric -- center of the abdomen just below the rib cage Periumbilical -- area around the bellybutton"
4355,What causes Abdominal mass?,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause a pulsating mass around the navel. Bladder distention (urinary bladder over-filled with fluid) can cause a firm mass in the center of the lower abdomen above the pelvic bones, in extreme cases it can reach as far up as the navel. Cholecystitis can cause a very tender mass that is felt below the liver in the right-upper quadrant (occasionally). Colon cancer and Volvulus can cause a mass at any location in the abdomen. Crohn's disease or bowel obstruction can cause many tender, sausage-shaped masses anywhere in the abdomen. Diverticulitis can cause a mass that is usually located in the left-lower quadrant. Gallbladder tumor can cause a tender, irregularly shaped mass in the right-upper quadrant. Hydronephrosis (fluid-filled kidney) can cause a smooth, spongy-feeling mass in one or both sides or toward the back (flank area). Kidney cancer can sometimes cause a mass in the abdomen. Liver cancer can cause a firm, lumpy mass in the right upper quadrant. Liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) can cause a firm, irregular mass below the right rib cage, or on the left side in the stomach area. Neuroblastoma, a cancerous tumor, often found in the lower abdomen, that mainly occurs in children and infants. Ovarian cyst can cause a smooth, rounded, rubbery mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen. Pancreatic abscess can cause a mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area. Pancreatic pseudocyst can cause a lumpy mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area. Renal cell carcinoma can cause a smooth, firm, but not tender mass near the kidney (usually only affects one kidney). Spleen enlargement (splenomegaly) can sometimes be felt in the left-upper quadrant. Stomach cancer can cause a mass in the left-upper abdomen in the stomach area (epigastric) if the cancer is large. Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) can cause a round, lumpy mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen (sometimes can be felt if the fibroids are large). Ureteropelvic junction obstruction can cause a mass in the lower abdomen."
4356,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Abdominal mass ?,"Seek immediate medical help if you have a pulsating lump in your abdomen along with severe abdominal pain. This could be a sign of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is an emergency condition.
Contact your doctor if you notice any type of abdominal mass."
4357,What are the symptoms of Abdominal pain?,"Almost everyone has pain in the abdomen at one time or another, a majority of which are not caused by a serious medical problem.
How bad your pain feels doesn't always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain.
For example, you might feel severe abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to a viral gastroenteritis.
On the other hand, life-threatening conditions such as colon cancer or early appendicitis may only cause mild pain or no pain.
Other ways of describing pain in your abdomen include:
Pain may be generalized, meaning that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines. Pain that is localized is found in only one area of your belly. This type of pain is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach. Cramp like pain is usually not serious and is more likely to be due to gas and bloating which is followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with fever. Colicky pain is pain that comes in waves. It usually starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of belly pain."
4358,What causes Abdominal pain?,"Many different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when you need to get immediate medical care. Sometimes you may only need to call a doctor if your symptoms continue.
Less serious causes of abdominal pain include:
Constipation Food allergies or intolerance (such as lactose intolerance) Food poisoning Irritable bowel syndrome Stomach flu
Other possible causes include:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm Appendicitis Bowel blockage or obstruction Cancer of the stomach, colon, and other organs Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) with or without gallstones Decreased blood supply to the intestines (ischemic bowel) Diverticulitis Heartburn, indigestion, or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) Kidney stones Pancreatitis (swelling or infection of the pancreas) Ulcers
Sometimes abdominal pain may be due to a problem somewhere else in your body, such as your chest or pelvic area. For example, you may have abdominal pain if you have:
Endometriosis Heart attack Muscle strain Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Pneumonia Severe menstrual cramps Tubal (ectopic) pregnancy Urinary tract infections"
4359,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Abdominal pain ?,"Seek immediate medical help or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if you:
Are currently being treated for cancer Are pregnant or could be pregnant Are unable to pass stool, especially if you are also vomiting Are vomiting blood or have blood in your stool (especially if it's maroon or dark, tarry black in color) Had a recent injury to your abdomen Have chest, neck, or shoulder pain Have difficulty breathing Have pain in, or between, your shoulder blades with nausea Have sudden, sharp abdominal pain Have tenderness in your belly, or your belly is rigid and hard to the touch
Call your doctor if you have:
Abdominal discomfort that lasts 1 week or longer Abdominal pain that does not improve in 24 - 48 hours, or becomes more severe and frequent and occurs with nausea and vomiting Bloating that persists for more than 2 days Burning sensation when you urinate or frequent urination Diarrhea for more than 5 days Fever (over 100°F for adults or 100.4°F for children) with your pain Prolonged poor appetite Prolonged vaginal bleeding Unexplained weight loss"
4360,What causes accessory pancreas?,The cause is not very clear. It is thought to be related to abnormal embryo development.
4361,what are the symptoms of accessory pancreas?,"Some patients with accessory pancreas may not show any symptom or sign. The disorder is revealed by other diseases such as diabetic, disorder of biliary tract or duodenum, or abdominal trauma or surgery, or examination. Other patients may have symptoms as the following:
Low-grade fever Weakness and fatigue Pain in the upper abdomen or epigastric area Itching Nausea and vomiting Jaundice
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4362,Who is at risk for accessory pancreas?,Studies suggest that this disorder is related to abnormal embryo development.
4363,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Accessory pancreas ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of accessory pancreas develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain Severe nausea and vomiting"
4364,What to expect if I have Accessory pancreas  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of accessory pancreas depends on whether secondary pathologic changes take place or not. If any carcinomatous change on accessory pancreas, outcome of patient is poor."
4365,What are the symptoms of Acute cholecystitis?,"The main symptom is pain in the upper right side or upper middle of the abdomen. The pain may:
Sharp, cramping, or dull Steady Radiating to the back or below the right scapula
Other symptoms that may occur include:
Clay-colored stools Fever Nausea and vomiting Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)"
4366,What causes Acute cholecystitis?,"In 90% of cases, acute cholecystitis is caused by gallstones in the gallbladder. Other causes include severe illness and (rarely) tumors of the gallbladder. Acute cholecystitis occurs when bile becomes trapped in the gallbladder. The buildup of bile causes irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to infection and a hole (perforation) in the organ."
4367,Who is at highest risk for Acute cholecystitis ?,Gallstone disease Women are at more risk than men. Native Americans and Hispanics have a higher rate of gallstones than most other people.
4368,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute cholecystitis ?,Severe abdominal pain If symptoms of cholecystitis return after a previous episode
4369,What to expect if I have Acute cholecystitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Patients who have surgery to remove the gallbladder usually do very well.
4370,What are the symptoms of Diarrhea?,"Diarrhea may be accompanied by cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or an urgent need to use the bathroom. Depending on the cause, a person may have a fever or bloody stools."
4371,What are the causes of Diarrhea?,"Acute diarrhea is usually related to a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Chronic diarrhea is usually related to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease.
A few of the more common causes of diarrhea include the following:
Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria consumed through contaminated food or water can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis. Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest food components such as artificial sweeteners and lactose—the sugar found in milk. Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium. Reaction to medicines. Antibiotics, blood pressure medications, cancer drugs, and antacids containing magnesium can all cause diarrhea. Intestinal diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease often lead to diarrhea. Functional bowel disorders. Diarrhea can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.
Some people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon after gallbladder surgery.
People who visit foreign countries are at risk for traveler’s diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Traveler’s diarrhea can be a problem for people visiting developing countries. Visitors to the United States, Canada, most European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand do not face much risk for traveler’s diarrhea.
In many cases, the cause of diarrhea cannot be found. As long as diarrhea goes away on its own, an extensive search for the cause is not usually necessary."
4372,Who is at risk for Diarrhea?,"Anyone can get diarrhea. This common problem can last a day or two or for months or years, depending on the cause. Most people get better on their own, but diarrhea can be serious for babies and older people if lost fluids are not replaced. Many people throughout the world die from diarrhea because of the large volume of water lost and the accompanying loss of salts."
4373,What are the symptoms of Anal fistula ?,"Patients with anal fistula may experience the following symptoms:
Pain Discharge, either bloody or purulent Pruritus ani or itching Fatigue Irritation of skin around the anus Visible redness and swelling If fistula becomes infected, fever and chills
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4374,Who is at highest risk for Anal fistula ?,"The following factors increase your chance of developing an anal fistula. If you have any of these risk factors, discuss them with your doctor:
Colitis or other inflammatory bowel disease, for example Crohn's disease Passage of hard stool Chronic diarrhea"
4375,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anal fistula ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of anal fistula develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:

4377,What are the symptoms of Ankyloglossia?,"Symptoms of ankyloglossia include an inability to stick the tongue forward, difficulty feeding, excessive attachment of tongue to bottom of the mouth, V-shaped notch in tip of tongue."
4378,What causes Ankyloglossia?,"Tongue tie occurs when the tissue on the underside of the front of the tongue is positioned too far forward on the tongue, making it difficult to move the tongue. This tissue is called the lingual frenulum.
If the tissue reaches the tip of the tongue, a V-shaped notch may be seen.
Tongue tie may cause feeding problems, tooth problems, and speech problems."
4379,Who is at highest risk for Ankyloglossia ?,Ankyloglossia may be genetic.
4380,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ankyloglossia ?,"If you are concerned that your child may have tongue tie, have your health care provider examine it during a routine well-baby examination."
4381,What to expect if I have Ankyloglossia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Surgery, if performed, is usually successful."
4382,What are the symptoms of Ascending cholangitis?,"The following symptoms may occur:
Abdominal pain which is in the right upper side or middle of the upper abdomen and may come and go. Pain is sharp, crampy, or dull and may move to the back or below the right shoulder blade. Chills Fever Clay-colored stools Dark urine Nausea and vomiting Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) -- may come and go"
4383,What causes Ascending cholangitis?,"Cholangitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection, which can occur when the duct is blocked by something, such as a gallstone or tumor. The infection causing this condition may also spread to the liver. Risk factors include a previous history of gallstones, sclerosing cholangitis, HIV, narrowing of the common bile duct, and, rarely, travel to countries where you might catch a worm or parasite infection."

4385,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ascending cholangitis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of cholangitis.
4386,What to expect if I have Ascending cholangitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually good with treatment, but poor without it. Modern improvements in diagnosis and treatment have led to a reduction in mortality."
4387,What are the symptoms of Ascites?,"When just a small amount of fluid has collected in the belly, there may be no symptoms. Symptoms often develop slowly or suddenly, but a rapid buildup of fluid and symptoms may occur with some causes of ascites.
As more fluid collects, abdominal pain and bloating may occur. When a large amount of ascites is present shortness of breath may develop also."
4388,What causes Ascites ?,"A person with ascites usually has severe liver disease. Ascites due to liver disease is caused by high pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) and low albumin levels.
Cirrhosis and any illness that leads to it is a common cause of ascites. Long-term infections with hepatitis C or B and long-term alcohol abuse are two of the most common causes of cirrhosis.
People with colon cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer may develop ascites. Other conditions which may lead to this problem include:
Disorders that may be associated with ascites include:
Clots in the veins of the liver (portal vein thrombosis) Congestive heart failure Pancreatitis Thickening and scarring of the sac like covering of the heart
Kidney dialysis may also be associated with ascites."
4389,When to Contact a Medical Professional ?,Anyone who has ascites and develops new abdominal pain and fever should contact their health care provider immediately.
4390,What are the symptoms of blind loop syndrome?,Diarrhea Fatty stools Fullness after a meal Loss of appetite Nausea Unintentional weight loss
4391,What causes blind loop syndrome?,"The name of this condition refers to the ""blind loop"" formed by the blocked intestine. This blind loop does not allow the normal flow of digested food through the intestinal tract.
When a section of the intestine is blocked by blind loop syndrome, bile salts needed to digest fats become ineffective, resulting in fatty stools and poor absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur because the extra bacteria that develop in this situation use up all of the vitamin.
Blind loop syndrome is a complication that occurs after many operations, including subtotal gastrectomy (surgical removal of part of the stomach), operations for extreme obesity, or as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease or scleroderma."
4392,Who is at highest risk for Blind loop syndrome ?,"Having a surgical procedure such as a subtotal gastrectomy or a procedure for obesity can put you at risk for developing blind loop syndrome.
People who have IBD or scleroderma are also at risk."
4393,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Blind loop syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of blind loop syndrome.
4394,What causes Bloody or tarry stools?,"The upper part of the GI tract will usually cause black stools due to: Abnormal blood vessels (vascular malformation) A tear in the esophagus from violent vomiting (Mallory-Weiss tear) Bleeding stomach or duodenal ulcer Inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis) Lack of proper blood flow to the intestines (bowel ischemia) Trauma or foreign body Widened, overgrown veins (called varices) in the esophagus and stomach The lower part of the GI tract will usually cause maroon or bright red, bloody stools due to: Anal fissures Bowel ischemia (when blood supply is cut off to part of the intestines) Colon polyps or colon cancer Diverticulosis (abnormal pouches in the colon) Hemorrhoids (common cause) Inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) Intestinal infection (such as bacterial enterocolitis) Small bowel tumor Trauma or foreign body Vascular malformation (abnormal collections of blood vessels called arteriovenous malformations or AVMs)
Eating black licorice, lead, iron pills, bismuth medicines like Pepto-Bismol, or blueberries can also cause black stools. Beets and tomatoes can sometimes make stools appear reddish. In these cases, your doctor can test the stool with a chemical to rule out the presence of blood. Bleeding in the esophagus or stomach (such as with peptic ulcer disease) can also cause you to vomit blood."
4395,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bloody or tarry stools ?,"Call your doctor immediately if you notice blood or changes in the color of your stool. Even if you think that hemorrhoids are causing the blood in your stool, your doctor should examine you to make sure that there is no other, more serious cause present. In children, a small amount of blood in the stool is usually not serious. The most common causes are constipation and milk allergies. However, it is still worth reporting to your doctor, even if no evaluation is needed."
4396,What are the symptoms of Boerhaave syndrome?,"Most common symptoms of Boerhaave syndrome include:
Severe throat pain Upper abdominal pain Fever Pain with swallowing"
4397,What causes Boerhaave syndrome?,"Causes of Boerhaave syndrome include:
Seizures Severe straining Vomiting Childbirth Procedures involving the esophagus (such as endoscopy) Prolonged coughing or laughing"

4400,What are the symptoms of Choledocholithiasis?,"Symptoms usually do not occur unless the stone blocks the common bile duct. Symptoms that may occur include:
Abdominal pain in the right upper or middle upper abdomen that may: Come and go Be sharp, cramping, or dull Spread to the back or below the right shoulder blade Get worse after eating fatty or greasy foods Occurs within minutes of a meal Fever Loss of appetite Jaundice (yellowing of skin and whites of eyes) Nausea Vomiting"
4401,What causes Choledocholithiasis?,"While stones can frequently pass through the common bile duct into the duodenum, some stones may be too large to pass through the CBD and will cause an obstruction."
4402,Who is at highest risk for Choledocholithiasis ?,"Risk Factors include:
A previous medical history of gallstones
Choledocholithiasis can occur in people who have had their gallbladder removed"
4403,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Choledocholithiasis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if abdominal pain with or without fever develops that is not attributable to other causes, if jaundice develops, or if other symptoms suggestive of choledocholithiasis occur."
4404,What to expect if I have Choledocholithiasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Blockage and infection caused by stones in the biliary tract can be life threatening. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, the outcome is usually very good.

4405,What are the symptoms of Chronic pancreatitis?,"Symptoms of Chronic pancreatitis include
Abdominal pain Greatest in the upper abdomen May last from hours to days Eventually may be continuous May be worsened by eating or drinking May be worsened by drinking alcohol May spread (radiate) to the back Digestive problems Fatty stools Nausea and vomiting Pale or clay-colored stools Unintentional weight loss
The symptoms may become more frequent as the condition gets worse. The symptoms may mimic pancreatic cancer. Sitting up and leaning forward may sometimes relieve the abdominal pain of pancreatitis."
4406,What causes Chronic pancreatitis?,"Chronic pancreatitis causes inflammation and scarring of tissue in the pancreas. This makes the pancreas unable to produce the right amount of chemicals (enzymes) needed to digest fat. It also interferes with insulin production, which may lead to diabetes.
The condition is most often caused by alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Sometimes the cause cannot be determined, however. Genetic causes have become more common. Other conditions have also been linked to chronic pancreatitis, such as:
Chronic blockage of the pancreatic duct Injury Hyperlipidemia Hyperparathyroidism"
4407,Who is at highest risk for Chronic pancreatitis ?,Chronic pancreatitis occurs more frequently in men than in women. This may be because alcohol-use disorders are more common in men.
4408,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic pancreatitis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of pancreatitis You have pancreatitis and your symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment"
4409,What to expect if I have Chronic pancreatitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,This is a serious disease that may lead to disability and death. You can reduce the risk by avoiding alcohol.
4410,What are the Symptoms of Colon Polyps?,"Polyps usually do not have symptoms. When present, symptoms may include:
Blood in the stools Change in bowel habit Fatigue caused by losing blood over time"
4411,What Causes Colon Polyps?,"Polyps of the colon and rectum are most often benign. This means they are not a cancer and do not spread. You may have one or many polyps. They become more common with age. There are many types of polyps.
Adenomatous polyps are a common type. They are gland -like growths that develop on the mucous membrane that lines the large intestine. They are also called adenomas and are most often one of the following:
Tubular polyp, which protrudes out in the lumen (open space) of the colon Villous adenoma, which is sometimes flat and spreading, and is more likely to become a cancer
When adenomas become cancerous, they are known as adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that originate in glandular tissue cells. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of colorectal cancer.
Other types of polyps are:
Hyperplastic polyp, which rarely, if ever, develop into cancer Serrated polyp, which is less common, but may develop into cancer over time
A small number of people with polyps may also be linked to some inherited disorders, including:
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) Gardner syndrome (a type of FAP) Juvenile polyposis (disease that causes many benign growths in the intestine, usually before 20 years old) Lynch syndrome (HNPCC, a disease that raises the chance of many types of cancer, including in the intestine) Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (disease that causes intestinal polyps, usually in the small intestine and usually benign)"
4412,Who is at highest risk for Colon polyps ?,"Polyps bigger than 1 centimeter (cm) have a higher cancer risk than polyps smaller than 1 centimeter. Risk factors include:
Age Family history of colon cancer or polyps A type of polyp called villous adenoma"
4413,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Colon polyps ?,"Call your provider if you have:
Blood in a bowel movement Change in bowel habit"
4414,Where to find Medical Care for Colon Polyps?,Medical care for (disease name) can be found here.
4415,What to expect if I have Colon polyps  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Outlook is excellent if the polyps are removed. Polyps that are not removed can develop into cancer over time.
4416,What are the symptoms of a diaphragmatic hernia?,"Severe breathing difficulty usually develops shortly after the baby is born, because of ineffective movement of the diaphragm and crowding of the lung tissue, which causes collapse. The reason why this occurs is not known.
Other symptoms include:
Bluish colored skin due to lack of oxygen Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Fast heart rate (tachycardia)"
4417,What are the causes of a diaphragmatic hernia?,"A diaphragmatic hernia is caused by the improper joining of structures during fetal development. As a result, the abdominal organs such as the stomach, small intestine, spleen, part of the liver, and the kidney appear in the chest cavity. The lung tissue on the affected side is thus not allowed to completely develop."
4418,Who is at risk for a diaphragmatic hernia?,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is seen in 1 out of every 2,200 to 5,000 live births. Most affect the left side. Having a parent or sibling with the condition slightly increases your risk."
4419,How to know you have a diaphragmatic hernia (Diagnosis)?,"The pregnant mother may have excessive amounts of amniotic fluid. Fetal ultrasound may show abdominal contents in the chest cavity.
Examination of the infant shows:
Irregular chest movements Absent breath sounds on affected side Bowel sounds heard in the chest Abdomen feels less full on examination by touch (palpation)
A chest x-ray may show abdominal organs in chest cavity."
4420,What are the symptoms of Constipation?,"When the stool is hard, infrequent, and requires significant effort to pass, you have constipation. The passage of large, wide stools may tear the mucosal membrane of the anus, especially in children. This can cause bleeding and the possibility of an anal fissure."
4421,What are the causes of Constipation?,"To understand constipation, it helps to know how the colon, or large intestine, works. As food moves through the colon, the colon absorbs water from the food while it forms waste products, or stool. Muscle contractions in the colon then push the stool toward the rectum. By the time stool reaches the rectum it is solid, because most of the water has been absorbed.
Constipation occurs when the colon absorbs too much water or if the colon’s muscle contractions are slow or sluggish, causing the stool to move through the colon too slowly. As a result, stools can become hard and dry. Common causes of constipation are
not enough fiber in the diet lack of physical activity medications milk irritable bowel syndrome changes in life or routine such as pregnancy, aging, and travel abuse of laxatives ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement dehydration specific diseases or conditions, such as stroke (most common) problems with the colon and rectum problems with intestinal function (chronic idiopathic constipation)
People who eat a high-fiber diet are less likely to become constipated. The most common causes of constipation are a diet low in fiber or a diet high in fats, such as cheese, eggs, and meats.
Fiber—both soluble and insoluble—is the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains that the body cannot digest. Soluble fiber dissolves easily in water and takes on a soft, gel-like texture in the intestines. Insoluble fiber passes through the intestines almost unchanged. The bulk and soft texture of fiber help prevent hard, dry stools that are difficult to pass.
Americans eat an average of 5 to 14 grams of fiber daily,* which is short of the 20 to 35 grams recommended by the American Dietetic Association. Both children and adults often eat too many refined and processed foods from which the natural fiber has been removed.
A low-fiber diet also plays a key role in constipation among older adults, who may lose interest in eating and choose foods that are quick to make or buy, such as fast foods, or prepared foods, both of which are usually low in fiber. Also, difficulties with chewing or swallowing may cause older people to eat soft foods that are processed and low in fiber.
National Center for Health Statistics. Dietary Intake of Macronutrients, Micronutrients, and Other Dietary Constituents: United States, 1988–94. Vital and Health Statistics, Series 11, Number 245. July 2002.
Research shows that although increased fluid intake does not necessarily help relieve constipation, many people report some relief from their constipation if they drink fluids such as water and juice and avoid dehydration. Liquids add fluid to the colon and bulk to stools, making bowel movements softer and easier to pass. People who have problems with constipation should try to drink liquids every day. However, liquids that contain caffeine, such as coffee and cola drinks will worsen one’s symptoms by causing dehydration. Alcohol is another beverage that causes dehydration. It is important to drink fluids that hydrate the body, especially when consuming caffeine containing drinks or alcoholic beverages.
A lack of physical activity can lead to constipation, although doctors do not know precisely why. For example, constipation often occurs after an accident or during an illness when one must stay in bed and cannot exercise. Lack of physical activity is thought to be one of the reasons constipation is common in older people.
Some medications can cause constipation, including
pain medications (especially narcotics) antacids that contain aluminum and calcium blood pressure medications (calcium channel blockers) antiparkinson drugs antispasmodics antidepressants iron supplements diuretics anticonvulsants
During pregnancy, women may be constipated because of hormonal changes or because the uterus compresses the intestine. Aging may also affect bowel regularity, because a slower metabolism results in less intestinal activity and muscle tone. In addition, people often become constipated when traveling, because their normal diet and daily routine are disrupted.
The common belief that people must have a daily bowel movement has led to self-medicating with OTC laxative products. Although people may feel relief when they use laxatives, typically they must increase the dose over time because the body grows reliant on laxatives in order to have a bowel movement. As a result, laxatives may become habit-forming. Ignoring the Urge to Have a Bowel Movement
People who ignore the urge to have a bowel movement may eventually stop feeling the need to have one, which can lead to constipation. Some people delay having a bowel movement because they do not want to use toilets outside the home. Others ignore the urge because of emotional stress or because they are too busy. Children may postpone having a bowel movement because of stressful toilet training or because they do not want to interrupt their play.
Diseases that cause constipation include neurological disorders, metabolic and endocrine disorders, and systemic conditions that affect organ systems. These disorders can slow the movement of stool through the colon, rectum, or anus.
Conditions that can cause constipation are found below.
Neurological disorders multiple sclerosis Parkinson's disease chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction stroke spinal cord injuries
Metabolic and endocrine conditions diabetes uremia hypercalcemia poor glycemic control hypothyroidism
Systemic disorders amyloidosis lupus scleroderma
Intestinal obstruction, scar tissue—also called adhesions—diverticulosis, tumors, colorectal stricture, Hirschsprung disease, or cancer can compress, squeeze, or narrow the intestine and rectum and cause constipation.
The two types of constipation are idiopathic constipation and functional constipation. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant symptoms of constipation is categorized separately.
Idiopathic—of unknown origin—constipation does not respond to standard treatment.
Functional constipation means that the bowel is healthy but not working properly. Functional constipation is often the result of poor dietary habits and lifestyle. It occurs in both children and adults and is most common in women. Colonic inertia, delayed transit, and pelvic floor dysfunction are three types of functional constipation. Colonic inertia and delayed transit are caused by a decrease in muscle activity in the colon. These syndromes may affect the entire colon or may be confined to the lower, or sigmoid, colon.
Pelvic floor dysfunction is caused by a weakness of the muscles in the pelvis surrounding the anus and rectum. However, because this group of muscles is voluntarily controlled to some extent, biofeedback training is somewhat successful in retraining the muscles to function normally and improving the ability to have a bowel movement.
Functional constipation that stems from problems in the structure of the anus and rectum is known as anorectal dysfunction, or anismus. These abnormalities result in an inability to relax the rectal and anal muscles that allow stool to exit.
People with IBS having predominantly constipation also have pain and bloating as part of their symptoms."
4422,Who is at risk for Constipation?,"Constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal complaints in the United States. More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year. Those reporting constipation most often are women and adults ages 65 and older. Pregnant women may have constipation, and it is a common problem following childbirth or surgery."
4423,How to know you have Constipation (Diagnosis)?,"The tests the doctor performs depend on the duration and severity of the constipation, the person’s age, and whether blood in stools, recent changes in bowel habits, or weight loss have occurred. Most people with constipation do not need extensive testing and can be treated with changes in diet and exercise. For example, in young people with mild symptoms, a medical history and physical exam may be all that is needed for diagnosis and treatment. Medical History
The doctor may ask a patient to describe his or her constipation, including duration of symptoms, frequency of bowel movements, consistency of stools, presence of blood in the stool, and toilet habits—how often and where one has bowel movements. A record of eating habits, medication, and level of physical activity will also help the doctor determine the cause of constipation.
The clinical definition of constipation is having any two of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks—not always consecutive—in the previous 12 months:
straining during bowel movements lumpy or hard stool sensation of incomplete evacuation sensation of anorectal blockage/obstruction fewer than three bowel movements per week
A physical exam may include a rectal exam with a gloved, lubricated finger to evaluate the tone of the muscle that closes off the anus—also called anal sphincter—and to detect tenderness, obstruction, or blood. In some cases, blood and thyroid tests may be necessary to look for thyroid disease and serum calcium or to rule out inflammatory, metabolic, and other disorders.
Extensive testing usually is reserved for people with severe symptoms, for those with sudden changes in the number and consistency of bowel movements or blood in the stool, and older adults. Additional tests that may be used to evaluate constipation include
a colorectal transit study anorectal function tests a defecography
Because of an increased risk of colorectal cancer in older adults, the doctor may use tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including a
barium enema x ray sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy
Colorectal transit study. This test shows how well food moves through the colon. The patient swallows capsules containing small markers that are visible on an x ray. The movement of the markers through the colon is monitored by abdominal x rays taken several times 3 to 7 days after the capsule is swallowed. The patient eats a high-fiber diet during the course of this test.
Anorectal function tests. These tests diagnose constipation caused by abnormal functioning of the anus or rectum—also called anorectal function.
Anorectal manometry evaluates anal sphincter muscle function. For this test, a catheter or air-filled balloon is inserted into the anus and slowly pulled back through the sphincter muscle to measure muscle tone and contractions. Balloon expulsion tests consist of filling a balloon with varying amounts of water after it has been rectally inserted. Then the patient is asked to expel the balloon. The inability to expel a balloon filled with less than 150 mL of water may indicate a decrease in bowel function.
Defecography is an x ray of the anorectal area that evaluates completeness of stool elimination, identifies anorectal abnormalities, and evaluates rectal muscle contractions and relaxation. During the exam, the doctor fills the rectum with a soft paste that is the same consistency as stool. The patient sits on a toilet positioned inside an x-ray machine, then relaxes and squeezes the anus to expel the paste. The doctor studies the x rays for anorectal problems that occurred as the paste was expelled.
Barium enema x ray. This exam involves viewing the rectum, colon, and lower part of the small intestine to locate problems. This part of the digestive tract is known as the bowel. This test may show intestinal obstruction and Hirschsprung disease, which is a lack of nerves within the colon.
The night before the test, bowel cleansing, also called bowel prep, is necessary to clear the lower digestive tract. The patient drinks a special liquid to flush out the bowel. A clean bowel is important, because even a small amount of stool in the colon can hide details and result in an incomplete exam.
Because the colon does not show up well on x rays, the doctor fills it with barium, a chalky liquid that makes the area visible. Once the mixture coats the inside of the colon and rectum, x rays are taken that show their shape and condition. The patient may feel some abdominal cramping when the barium fills the colon but usually feels little discomfort after the procedure. Stools may be white in color for a few days after the exam.
Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. An examination of the rectum and lower, or sigmoid, colon is called a sigmoidoscopy. An examination of the rectum and entire colon is called a colonoscopy.
The person usually has a liquid dinner the night before a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and takes an enema early the next morning. An enema an hour before the test may also be necessary.
To perform a sigmoidoscopy, the doctor uses a long, flexible tube with a light on the end, called a sigmoidoscope, to view the rectum and lower colon. The patient is lightly sedated before the exam. First, the doctor examines the rectum with a gloved, lubricated finger. Then, the sigmoidoscope is inserted through the anus into the rectum and lower colon. The procedure may cause abdominal pressure and a mild sensation of wanting to move the bowels. The doctor may fill the colon with air to get a better view. The air can cause mild cramping.
To perform a colonoscopy, the doctor uses a flexible tube with a light on the end, called a colonoscope, to view the entire colon. This tube is longer than a sigmoidoscope. During the exam, the patient lies on his or her side, and the doctor inserts the tube through the anus and rectum into the colon. If an abnormality is seen, the doctor can use the colonoscope to remove a small piece of tissue for examination (biopsy). The patient may feel gassy and bloated after the procedure."
4424,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Constipation ?,"Call your doctor if you have:
Sudden constipation with abdominal cramps and an inability to pass gas or stool (DO NOT take any laxatives -- call immediately!) Sharp or severe abdominal pain, especially if you're also bloated Blood in your stool Constipation alternating with diarrhea Thin, pencil-like stools Rectal pain Unexplained weight loss Been using laxatives for several weeks or self care is not working
Call if:
An infant younger than 2 months is constipated An infant (except those exclusively breastfed) goes 3 days without a stool -- call immediately if the child is vomiting or irritable A child is holding back bowel movements in order to resist toilet training"
4425,What are the Symptoms of cystic fibrosis?,"Skin tastes salty Baby does not pass stool when first born
Pulmonary infections (cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum that is sometimes bloody) Nasal polyps (growths in the nose)
Diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools (mucus can block ducts in pancreas and prevents enzymes from reaching the intestines. As a result, intestines can not fully absorb fats and proteins. Stomach pain and discomfort (because of too much gas or severe constipation) Poor weight gain and growth (because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins)
Rectal prolapse (frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside to move out of rectum)"
4426,What Causes cystic fibrosis?,"The CFTR gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells. In people who have cystic fibrosis, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. More than a thousand defects are known that can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect may affect the severity of cystic fibrosis."
4427,Who is at highest risk for Cystic fibrosis ?,"Every person inherits two CFTR genes, one from each parent. Children who inherit two faulty CFTR gene from both parents will have CF."
4428,Where to find Medical Care for Cystic fibrosis?,Medical care for cystic fibrosis can be found here.
4429,What to expect if I have Cystic fibrosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis has been increased over past decades because of better symptomatic treatment strategies. In patients with cystic fibrosis, lung complications are currently the primary causes of morbidity and are responsible for 80% of mortality. At present time survival probability of children is 40-50 years"
4430,What are the symptoms of Diarrhea?,"Diarrhea may be accompanied by cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or an urgent need to use the bathroom. Depending on the cause, a person may have a fever or bloody stools."
4431,What are the causes of Diarrhea?,"Acute diarrhea is usually related to a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Chronic diarrhea is usually related to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease.
A few of the more common causes of diarrhea include the following:
Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria consumed through contaminated food or water can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis. Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest food components such as artificial sweeteners and lactose—the sugar found in milk. Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium. Reaction to medicines. Antibiotics, blood pressure medications, cancer drugs, and antacids containing magnesium can all cause diarrhea. Intestinal diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease often lead to diarrhea. Functional bowel disorders. Diarrhea can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.
Some people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon after gallbladder surgery.
People who visit foreign countries are at risk for traveler’s diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Traveler’s diarrhea can be a problem for people visiting developing countries. Visitors to the United States, Canada, most European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand do not face much risk for traveler’s diarrhea.
In many cases, the cause of diarrhea cannot be found. As long as diarrhea goes away on its own, an extensive search for the cause is not usually necessary."
4432,Who is at risk for Diarrhea?,"Anyone can get diarrhea. This common problem can last a day or two or for months or years, depending on the cause. Most people get better on their own, but diarrhea can be serious for babies and older people if lost fluids are not replaced. Many people throughout the world die from diarrhea because of the large volume of water lost and the accompanying loss of salts."
4433,What are the symptoms of a Direct inguinal hernia?,"Symptoms of inguinal hernia include:
a small bulge in one or both sides of the groin that may increase in size and disappear when lying down; in males, it can present as a swollen or enlarged scrotum discomfort or sharp pain—especially when straining, lifting, or exercising—that improves when resting a feeling of weakness or pressure in the groin a burning, gurgling, or aching feeling at the bulge"
4434,What are the causes of a Direct inguinal hernia?,"Direct inguinal hernias are caused by connective tissue degeneration of the abdominal muscles, which causes weakening of the muscles during the adult years."
4435,Who is at risk for a Direct inguinal hernia?,An inguinal hernia can occur any time from infancy to adulthood and is much more common in males than females.
4436,How to know you have a Direct inguinal hernia (Diagnosis)?,"To diagnose inguinal hernia, the doctor takes a thorough medical history and conducts a physical examination. The person may be asked to stand and cough so the doctor can feel the hernia as it moves into the groin or scrotum. The doctor checks to see if the hernia can be gently massaged back into its proper position in the abdomen."
4437,What are the symptoms of Diverticulosis?,"Many people don’t have symptoms accompanying diverticulosis,but some people may experience any combination of the following symptoms:
Cramping Bloating Constipation Bleeding Inflammation Fistulas
If you are bleeding, bright red blood will pass through your rectum. The rectum is the end of the colon that connects to the anus. The rectum and anus are part of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the passage that food goes through. Rectal bleeding is usually painless, but it can be dangerous. You should see a doctor right away."
4438,What are the causes of Diverticulosis?,"Doctors are not sure what causes diverticular disease. Many think a diet low in fiber is the main cause. Fiber is a part of food that your body cannot digest. It is found in many fruits and vegetables. Fiber stays in the colon and absorbs water, which makes bowel movements easier to pass. Diets low in fiber may cause constipation, which occurs when stools are hard and difficult to pass. Constipation causes your muscles to strain when you pass stool. Straining may cause diverticula to form in the colon."
4439,Who is at highest risk for Diverticulosis ?,"People over the age of 40. Starting at age 40, the chance of getting it increases about every 10 years. About half of people between the ages of 60 and 80 have diverticular disease. Almost everyone over 80 has it. People who eat low fiber diets."
4440,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Diverticulosis ?,"Contact a doctor if you notice symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or change in bowel habits."
4441,What to expect if I have Diverticulosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most people with the disease do not have serious problems, but some people have severe symptoms. Diverticulitis can attack suddenly and cause
Bleeding Serious infections Rips in the pouches Fistula, which is a connection or passage between tissues or organs in the body that normally do not connect Blockage in your digestive system An infection in which the colon ruptures causing stool to empty from the colon into the abdomen"
4442,What are the symptoms of Dyspepsia?,"Symptoms may include:
A feeling of heat, burning, or pain in the area between the navel and the lower part of the breastbone A feeling of fullness that is bothersome and occurs soon after the meal begins or when it is over
Bloating or nausea are less common symptoms.
NOTE: Indigestion is NOT the same as heartburn."
4443,What causes Dyspepsia?,"Indigestion may be triggered by:
Drinking too much alcohol Eating spicy, fatty, or greasy foods Eating too much (overeating) Eating too fast Emotional stress or nervousness High-fiber foods Tobacco smoking Too much caffeine
Other causes of indigestion are:
Gallstones Gastritis (when the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed or swollen) Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Ulcers (stomach or intestinal ulcer) Use of certain drugs such as antibiotics, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Indigestion is usually not a sign of a more serious health problem, unless other symptoms also occur, such as weight loss or trouble swallowing.
Rarely, the discomfort of a heart attack is mistaken for indigestion."
4444,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dyspepsia ?,"Seek immediate medical help if your symptoms include jaw pain, chest pain, back pain, profuse sweating, anxiety, or a feeling of impending doom. These are possible heart attack symptoms.
Call your health care provider if:
Indigestion symptoms change noticeably Symptoms last longer than a few days You have unexplained weight loss You have sudden, severe abdominal pain You have trouble swallowing You have yellow coloring of the skin and eyes (jaundice) You vomit blood or pass blood in the stool"
4445,What to expect if I have Dyspepsia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Your doctor will perform a physical examination, paying special attention to the stomach area and digestive tract. You will be asked questions about your symptoms, including:
Do you drink a lot of caffeinated beverages (tea, soda, coffee)? Do you eat quickly? Does it begin or get worse after drinking alcoholic or carbonated drinks? Does the discomfort begin or get worse after eating certain foods? Have you been overeating? Have you changed medications recently? Have you changed your diet? Have you had any spicy, high-fiber, or fatty foods? What medications are you taking? What other symptoms do you have? For example, stomach pain or vomiting."
4446,What are the symptoms of Dysphagia ?,"Chest pain, the feeling of food stuck in the throat, or heaviness or pressure in the neck or upper or lower chest may be present, as well as:
Cough or wheezing that becomes worse Coughing up food that has not been digested Heartburn Nausea Sour taste in the mouth
You may have problems swallowing with any eating or drinking, or only with certain types of foods or liquids. Difficulty eating very hot or cold foods, dry crackers or bread, meat, or chicken may be an early sign of swallowing problems."
4447,What causes Dysphagia ?,"Swallowing is a complex act. Many nerves work in a fine balance to control how the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together. Much of swallowing occurs without you being aware of what you are doing.
A brain or nerve disorder can alter this fine balance in the muscles of the mouth and throat.
Damage to the brain may be caused by multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or stroke Nerve damage may be due to spinal cord injuries, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), or myasthenia gravis
Stress or anxiety may cause some people to feel tightness in the throat, or feel as if something is stuck in the throat. This is called globus hystericus.
Problems that involve the esophagus often cause swallowing problems, including:
An abnormal ring of tissue that forms where the esophagus and stomach meet (called Schatzki's ring) Abnormal spasms of the esophagus muscles Cancer of the esophagus Failure of the muscle ring at the bottom of the esophagus to relax (Achalasia) Scarring that narrows the esophagus. This may be due to radiation, chemicals, medicines, chronic swelling, ulcers, or infection. Something stuck in the esophagus, such as a piece of food. Scleroderma, a disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the esophagus Tumors in the chest that press on the esophagus."
4448,When to Contact a Medical Professional ?,"Call your health care provider if swallowing problems do not improve after a few days, or they come and go.
Call your doctor right away if:
You have a fever or shortness of breath You are losing weight Your swallowing problems are getting worse You cough or vomit up blood You have asthma that is becoming worse You feel as if you are choking during or after eating or drinking"
4449,What are the symptoms of Esophageal atresia?,"Bluish coloration to the skin (cyanosis) with attempted feedings Coughing, gagging, and choking with attempted feeding Drooling Poor feeding"
4450,What causes Esophageal atresia?,"Esophageal atresia is a congenital defect, which means it occurs before birth. There are several types. In most cases, the upper esophagus ends and does not connect with the lower esophagus and stomach. The top end of the lower esophagus connects to the windpipe. This connection is called a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Some babies with TEF will also have other problems, such as heart or other digestive tract disorders.
Other types of esophageal atresia involve narrowing of the esophagus, and may also be associated with other birth defects."
4451,Who is at highest risk for Esophageal atresia ?,"Esophageal atresia occurs in about 1 out of 4,000 births."
4452,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Esophageal atresia ?,"This disorder is usually diagnosed shortly after birth.
Call your baby's health care provider if the baby vomits repeatedly after feedings, or if the baby develops breathing difficulties."
4453,What to expect if I have Esophageal atresia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,An early diagnosis gives a better chance of a good outcome.
4454,What are the Symptoms of Esophageal Stricture?,Trouble swallowing Pain with swallowing Unintentional weight loss Regurgitation of food
4455,What Causes Esophageal Stricture?,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). Eosinophilic esophagitis Injuries caused by an endoscope Long-term use of a nasogastric (NG) tube (tube through the nose into the stomach). Swallowing substances that harm the lining of the esophagus. These may include household cleaners, lye, disc batteries, or battery acid. Treatment of esophageal varices
Frequent acid reflux make it more likely that you will develop esophageal stricture"
4456,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Esophageal stricture ?,Call your health care provider if you have swallowing problems that do not go away.
4457,Where to find Medical Care for esophageal stricture?,Medical care for esophageal stricture can be found here.
4458,What to expect if I have Esophageal stricture  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The stricture may come back in the future. This would require a repeat dilation.
4459,What are the symptoms of a Femoral hernia?,Groin discomfort or groin pain aggravated by bending or lifting Tender lump in the groin or upper thigh
4460,What are the causes of a Femoral hernia?,"A hernia occurs when abdominal contents, usually part of the small intestine, push through a weak point or tear in the thin muscular wall of the abdomen that holds the abdominal organs in place.
In a femoral hernia, a bulge is usually present in the upper part of the thigh, just below the groin, where the femoral artery and vein pass. Femoral hernias tend to occur more often in women than in men."
4461,Who is at risk for Femoral hernias?,Gender: Women are more likely to develop femoral hernias than men
4462,How to know you have a Femoral hernia?,A physical examination reveals the hernia. Tests are usually not necessary.
4463,What are the symptoms of gallbladder cancer?,"Because the gallbladder is located deep inside the body, your doctor cannot see or feel tumors during a routine physical exam. Therefore, it is hard to diagnose gallbladder cancer early. Sometimes, gallbladder cancers are found unexpectedly after removal of the gallbladder for other reasons, such as gallstones. As the cancer progresses, people may notice one or more symptoms as the following:
Jaundice: Is a yellowing of the sclera and skin. Normally, bilirubin is made in the liver and the liver excretes it into bile. Then bile goes into the intestines eventually leaving the body in the stool. Once the common bile duct becomes blocked, bile can't reach the intestines, and the level of bilirubin builds up. If the bile duct is blocked, bilirubin cannot get through to the intestines then stools may become lighter in color. Abdominal pain: Experiencing abdominal pain due to gallbladder cancer is because advanced gallbladder cancer start to compress other nearby organs. The pain may be constant or it may come and go. Gallbladder enlargement or lump in abdomen: Is because the cancer blocks the bile duct and bile builds up in the gallbladder to enlarge. Sometimes a doctor can feel this enlargement during the physical exam Digestive problems: Patients with gallbladder cancer are unable to digest fatty foods when cancer blocks the release of the bile into the intestine. This can cause nausea and vomiting that tend to be worse after eating. Undigested fat may cause stools to be pale, bulky, and greasy. Weight loss and marasmus, poor appetite: Unintended or unexpected weight loss is very common in patients with gallbladder cancer. These people also complain of being very tired and having little or no appetite.
Other health problems such as gallstones, hepatitis, and other pancreatic diseases may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell his/her doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4464,Who is at highest risk for Gallbladder adenocarcinoma ?,"There are some factors that may increase the chance of acquiring gallbladder cancer. These risk factors include:
Gallstones: This is the most common risk factor for gallbladder cancer. It is estimated that about 75% and 90% of people with gallbladder cancer have a history of gallstones. Gallstones are the most common digestive disease in the United States, but only a small proportion of people develop gallbladder cancer.
Gallbladder polyps: Gallbladder polyp is caused by small gallstones or cholecystitis. Because gallbladder polyps larger than 10 millimeters are likely to develop into cancer, surgeons often recommend removing the gallbladder.
Family history. People with family history of gallbladder cancer have a higher probability of developing gallbladder cancer.
Ethnicity: Epidemiology data demonstrates that Mexican Americans and Native Americans, particularly in the southwestern United States, are more likely to develop gallbladder cancer than the general population.
Age: Clinical data shows most people with gallbladder cancer are older than 70.
Gender: Epidemiology data shows women are about twice as likely to develop gallbladder cancer as men.
Smoking: Smoking may increase the risk of gallbladder cancer."
4465,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gallbladder adenocarcinoma ?,"Gallbladder cancer forms tumors which are very difficult to detect in the early stages. If symptoms of gallbladder cancer develop, go to see your doctor as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain, especially when accompanied with jaundice and fever"
4466,What to expect if I have Gallbladder adenocarcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis is not good for most gallbladder cancer patients if the cancer is detected in its late stages. The prognosis of gallbladder cancer also depends on the following factors:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the gallbladder The patient’s general health Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred
Patients diagnosed with Gallbladder cancer should avoid using the following medications:
Fenofibrate If you have been diagnosed with Gallbladder cancer, consult your physician before starting or stopping any of these medications."

4471,What are the symptoms of Gastritis?,Abdominal pain Abdominal indigestion Dark stools Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Vomiting blood or coffee-ground like material
4472,Who is at highest risk for Gastritis ?,"Risk factors for Gastritis include:
Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol Consuming excessive amounts of caffeine Taking medications such as aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Smoking Stress Having an infection with bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Having a major surgery Traumatic injury, burns, or severe infections Having certain diseases, such as pernicious anemia, autoimmune disorders, and chronic bile reflux"
4473,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gastritis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms of gastritis persist longer than 2 or 3 days. Call your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms:
Blood vomiting or vomitus with yellow or green emesis Bloody or dark stools Unusual rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Profuse sweating Fever associated with abdominal pain Pale complexion"
4474,What to expect if I have Gastritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most gastritis improves rapidly with treatment.
4475,What are the symptoms of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?,"The main symptom of GERD in adults is frequent heartburn, also called acid indigestion—burning-type pain in the lower part of the mid-chest, behind the breast bone, and in the mid-abdomen. Most children under 12 years with GERD, and some adults, have GERD without heartburn. Instead, they may experience a dry cough, asthma symptoms, or trouble swallowing."
4476,What are the causes of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?,"The reason some people develop GERD is still unclear. However, research shows that in people with GERD, the LES relaxes while the rest of the esophagus is working. Anatomical abnormalities such as a hiatal hernia may also contribute to GERD. A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach and the LES move above the diaphragm, the muscle wall that separates the stomach from the chest. Normally, the diaphragm helps the LES keep acid from rising up into the esophagus. When a hiatal hernia is present, acid reflux can occur more easily. A hiatal hernia can occur in people of any age and is most often a normal finding in otherwise healthy people over age 50. Most of the time, a hiatal hernia produces no symptoms.
Other factors that may contribute to GERD include:
Obesity Pregnancy Smoking
Common foods that can worsen reflux symptoms include:
Citrus fruits Chocolate Drinks with caffeine or alcohol Fatty and fried foods Garlic and onions Mint flavorings Spicy foods Tomato-based foods, like spaghetti sauce, salsa, chili, and pizza."
4477,Who is at risk for Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?,"Risk factors of GERD include:
Pregnancy Obesity Hiatal hernia Scleroderma Smoking Drinking a lot of alcohol Consuming drinks that contain caffiene Consuming the following foods:
Citrus fruits Chocolate Fatty and fried foods Garlic Onions Mint flavorings Spicy foods Tomato-based foods (spaghetti sauce, salsa, chili, and pizza)
Medications
Anticholinergics (e.g. for seasickness) Beta blockers for high blood pressure or heart disease Bronchodilators for asthma Calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure Dopamine-active drugs for Parkinson's disease Progestin for abnormal menstrual bleeding or birth control Sedatives for insomnia or anxiety Tricyclic antidepressants
If you suspect that one of your medications may be causing heartburn, talk to your doctor. Never change or stop medication you take regularly without talking to your doctor."
4478,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gastroesophageal reflux disease ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms worsen or do not improve with lifestyle changes or medication.
Also call for any of the following symptoms:
Bleeding Choking (coughing, shortness of breath) Early satiety (feeling filled up quickly when eating) Frequent vomiting Hoarseness Loss of appetite Trouble swallowing (dysphagia) or pain with swallowing (odynophagia) Weight loss"
4479,What to expect if I have Gastroesophageal reflux disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The majority of people respond to nonsurgical measures, with lifestyle changes and medications. However, many patients need to continue to take drugs to control their symptoms."
4480,What are the symptoms of Gastrointestinal bleeding?,"The amount of GI bleeding may be so small that it can only be detected on a lab test such as the fecal occult blood test. Other signs of GI bleeding include:
Dark, tarry stools Larger amounts of blood passed from the rectum Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl, on toilet paper, or in streaks on stool (feces) Vomiting blood
Massive bleeding from the GI tract can be dangerous. However, even very small amounts of bleeding that occur over a long period of time can lead to problems such as anemia or low blood counts.
Once a bleeding site is found, many therapies are available to stop the bleeding or treat the cause."
4481,What causes Gastrointestinal bleeding?,"GI bleeding may be due to conditions that are not serious, including:
Anal fissure Hemorrhoids
However, GI bleeding may also be a sign of more serious diseases and conditions, such as the following cancers of the GI tract:
Cancer of the colon Cancer of the small intestine Cancer of the stomach Intestinal polyps (a pre-cancerous condition)
Other possible causes of GI bleeding include:
Abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the intestines (also called angiodysplasias) Bleeding diverticulum, or diverticulosis Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Esophageal varices Esophagitis Gastric (stomach) ulcer Intussusception (bowel telescoped on itself) Mallory-Weiss tear Meckel's diverticulum Radiation injury to the bowel"
4482,Who is at highest risk for Gastrointestinal bleeding ?,"Call for an appointment with your doctor if:
You have black, tarry stools (this may be a sign of GI bleeding) You have blood in your stool You vomit blood or you vomit material that looks like coffee grounds"
4483,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gastrointestinal bleeding ?,"Call for an appointment with your doctor if:
You have black, tarry stools (this may be a sign of GI bleeding) You have blood in your stool You vomit blood or you vomit material that looks like coffee grounds"
4484,What are the symptoms of Gastrointestinal stromal tumor?,"Common symptoms of GIST include:
Blood (either bright red or very dark) in the stool or vomit. Pain in the abdomen, which may be severe. Feeling very tired. Trouble or pain when swallowing. Feeling full after only a little food is eaten. Sometimes GISTs are smaller than the eraser on top of a pencil. GIST tumors may be found during a procedure that is done for another reason, such as an x-ray or surgery. Some of these small tumors will not grow and cause signs or symptoms or spread to the abdomen or other parts of the body. Doctors do not agree on whether these small tumors should be removed or whether they should be watched to see if they begin to grow."
4485,What causes Gastrointestinal stromal tumor?,"Genetic mutations are considered the most identifiable cause of GIST. Around 95% of these mutations are sporadic (isolated) with less than 5% occur as part of hereditary, familial, or idiopathic multi tumor syndromes. Common causes of GIST include mutation in proto-oncogenes such as c-Kit gene and PDGFRA gene. These proto-oncogenes control cell multiplication and mutations in them can lead to excessive and uncontrolled cell multiplication leading to tumor formation. In other cases where the patient do not exhibit the typical mutation in c-Kit and PDGFRA gene, mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene have been reported. Rare genes involved include mutation in BRAF kinase and protein kinase C."
4486,Who is at highest risk for Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ?,"Age and genetic factors can increase the risk of having a GIST. Individuals in the age group of 50-80 years are believed to be at the highest risk. The risk of GIST is also increased in people with certain genetic syndromes such as Neurofibromatosis type 1, Carney-Stratakis syndrome and Familial gastrointestinal stromal tumor syndrome. In rare cases, GISTs can be found in several members of the same family."
4487,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ?,"If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible.
Severe abdominal pain - The reason a person with GIST appears to have severe abdominal pain is mostly because of gastric wall perforation. This is the result of cancer invading and perforating the gastric wall. Surgical intervention needs to be done urgently. Vomiting a lot of blood- This is the result of the cancer invading the vessels of the gastric wall. An abundant amount of blood loss may lead to shock and death."
4488,What to expect if I have Gastrointestinal stromal tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:
How quickly the cancer cells are growing and dividing. The size of the tumor. Where the tumor is in the body. Whether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery. Whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body."
4489,What are the symptoms of Gastroparesis?,"Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis include:
Heartburn Pain in the upper abdomen Nausea Vomiting of undigested food—sometimes several hours after a meal Early feeling of fullness after only a few bites of food Weight loss due to poor absorption of nutrients or low calorie intake Abdominal bloating High and low blood glucose levels Lack of appetite Gastroesophageal reflux Spasms in the stomach area
Eating solid foods, high-fiber foods such as raw fruits and vegetables, fatty foods, or drinks high in fat or carbonation may contribute to these symptoms.
The symptoms of gastroparesis may be mild or severe, depending on the person. Symptoms can happen frequently in some people and less often in others. Many people with gastroparesis experience a wide range of symptoms, and sometimes the disorder is difficult for the physician to diagnose."
4490,What are the causes of Gastroparesis?,"The most common cause of gastroparesis is diabetes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called blood sugar, which in turn causes chemical changes in nerves and damages the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the nerves. Over time, high blood glucose can damage the vagus nerve.
Some other causes of gastroparesis are:
Surgery on the stomach or vagus nerve Viral infections Anorexia nervosa or bulimia Medications(anticholinergics and narcotics)that slow contractions in the intestine Gastroesophageal reflux disease Smooth muscle disorders, such as amyloidosis and scleroderma Nervous system diseases, including abdominal migraine and Parkinson’s disease Metabolic disorders, including hypothyroidism
Many people have what is called idiopathic gastroparesis, meaning the cause is unknown and cannot be found even after medical tests."
4491,Who is at risk for Gastroparesis?,"Risk factors for gastroparesis include:
Diabetes Gastrectomy Systemic sclerosis Use of medication that inhibits certain nerve signals (anticholinergic medication)"
4492,How to know you have Gastroparesis (Diagnosis)?,"After performing a full physical exam and taking your medical history, your doctor may order several blood tests to check blood counts and chemical and electrolyte levels. To rule out an obstruction or other conditions, the doctor may perform the following tests:
Upper endoscopy. After giving you a sedative to help you become drowsy, the doctor passes a long, thin tube called an endoscope through your mouth and gently guides it down the throat, also called the esophagus, into the stomach. Through the endoscope, the doctor can look at the lining of the stomach to check for any abnormalities. Ultrasound. To rule out gallbladder disease and pancreatitis as sources of the problem, you may have an ultrasound test, which uses harmless sound waves to outline and define the shape of the gallbladder and pancreas. Barium x ray. After fasting for 12 hours, you will drink a thick liquid called barium, which coats the stomach, making it show up on the x ray. If you have diabetes, your doctor may have special instructions about fasting. Normally, the stomach will be empty of all food after 12 hours of fasting. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach. Because a person with gastroparesis can sometimes have normal emptying, the doctor may repeat the test another day if gastroparesis is suspected.
Once other causes have been ruled out, the doctor will perform one of the following gastric emptying tests to confirm a diagnosis of gastroparesis.
Gastric emptying scintigraphy. This test involves eating a bland meal, such as eggs or egg substitute, that contains a small amount of a radioactive substance, called radioisotope, that shows up on scans. The dose of radiation from the radioisotope is not dangerous. The scan measures the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. When more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. Breath test. After ingestion of a meal containing a small amount of isotope, breath samples are taken to measure the presence of the isotope in carbon dioxide, which is expelled when a person exhales. The results reveal how fast the stomach is emptying. SmartPill. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, the SmartPill is a small device in capsule form that can be swallowed.The device then moves through the digestive tract and collects information about its progress that is sent to a cell phone-sized receiver worn around your waist or neck. When the capsule is passed from the body with the stool in a couple of days, you take the receiver back to the doctor, who enters the information into a computer."
4493,What are the symptoms of Glucagonoma?,"Usual symptoms of glucagonoma involve a series of signs of hyperglucagonemia and hypoaminoacidemia:
Diarrhea
Excess thirst
Frequent urination and nighttime urination
Increased appetite
Inflamed mouth and tongue
Skin rash
Weight loss
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4494,Who is at highest risk for Glucagonoma ?,The cause of glucagonoma is not clear.
4495,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Glucagonoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of glucagonoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe diarrhea"
4496,What to expect if I have Glucagonoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Approximately 60% of these tumors are cancerous, therefore prognosis of glucagonoma depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery
The stage of the tumor: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the pancreas
The patient’s general
Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
4497,What causes Heartburn?,"Almost everyone has heartburn sometimes. If you have heartburn very often, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Normally when food or liquid enters your stomach, a band of muscle at the end of your esophagus closes off the esophagus. This band is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If this band does not close tightly enough, contents from the stomach can back up (reflux) into the esophagus. This partly digested material can irritate the esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms.
Heartburn is more likely if you have a hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia is when the top part of the stomach sticks up into the chest cavity. This weakens the LES and makes it easier for acid to back up from the stomach into the esophagus.
Pregnancy and many medications can bring on heartburn or make it worse."
4498,Who is at highest risk for Heartburn ?,"Drugs that can cause heartburn include:
Anticholinergics (e.g., for sea sickness) Beta-blockers for high blood pressure or heart disease Calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure Dopamine -like drugs for Parkinson's disease Progestin for abnormal menstrual bleeding or birth control Sedatives for anxiety, or if you can't sleep (insomnia) Theophylline (for asthma or other lung diseases) Tricyclic antidepressants
If you think one of your medicines may be causing heartburn, talk to your doctor. NEVER change or stop taking medicine without talking to your doctor."
4499,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Heartburn ?,"Get urgent medical care if:
You vomit material that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds Your stools are black (like tar) or maroon You have a burning feeling and a squeezing, crushing, or pressure in your chest. Sometimes people who think they have heartburn are having a heart attack
Call your doctor if:
You have heartburn often or it doesn't go away with a few weeks of self-care You lose weight that you didn't want to lose You have trouble swallowing (food feels stuck as it goes down) You have a cough or wheezing that does not go away Your symptoms get worse with antacids or H2 blockers You think one of your medicines may be causing heartburn. DO NOT change or stop taking your medicine on your own, without talking to your doctor first"
4500,What to expect if I have Heartburn  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Heartburn is usually easy to diagnose from the symptoms you describe to your doctor. Sometimes, heartburn can be confused with another stomach problem called dyspepsia. If the diagnosis is unclear, you may be sent to a doctor called a gastroenterologist for more testing.
First, your doctor will do a physical examination and ask questions about your heartburn, such as:
When did it begin? How long does each episode last? Is this the first time you have had heartburn? What do you usually eat at each meal? Before you feel heartburn, have you eaten a spicy or fatty meal? Do you drink a lot of coffee, other drinks with caffeine, or alcohol? Do you smoke?

A cough that produces more than a few teaspoons of blood Blood in your urine or stool Chest pain Dizziness Fever Light-headedness Severe shortness of breath"
4507,What are the symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma?,"In its earliest stages, hepatocellular carcinoma does not cause any symptoms. When the tumors grow larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Abdominal pain and vague abdominal fullness: At first the location of the abdominal pain you are experiencing may be isolated on the upper-right part of your abdomen. It is usually relatively mild pain or no pain at all that is present with this life-threatening condition. With the development of cancer, abdominal pain is usually persistent. Abdominal lump: People cannot find any lump at the beginning of the disease. When the tumor begins to enlarge, the lump may be obvious in the abdominal region. Jaundice and itching: This is caused by hepatocellular necrosis and obstruction of bile in the bile ducts. Nausea and vomiting: Hepatocellular carcinoma disturbs the normal functions of digestion. Vomiting blood: This symptom is attributed to many factors such as dysfunction of the liver and spleen. Loss of appetite General decline in health Weakness or fatigue Fever
Infections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4508,Who is at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma?,"There are some factors that may increase your risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. These risk factors include:

Sudden severe abdominal pain and a decrease in blood pressure: The reason a person with hepatocellular carcinoma has sudden severe abdominal pain is sometimes due to a ruptured carcinoma. This is the result of cancer developing very fast. Sometimes if the carcinoma invades the main vessel it results in a hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity and the patients may feel sudden abdominal pain. Vomiting a lot of blood: This is the result of complications such as dysfunction of the liver or synthetic blood coagulation factors and esophagogastric fundus vein rupture. An abundant amount of blood loss due to vomiting may lead to shock and even death."
4510,What to expect if I have Hepatocellular carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is poor and it depends on the following:

Many other diseases of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. They include the following:
Pre-renal failure: Pre-renal failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and the excretion of sodium.  Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): This can be difficult to confidently diagnose. It may be an inability to concentrate the urine, if any is being produced. The urine sediment should be bland, microscopy may show hyaline casts. ATN may recover with supportive treatment only or progress to end-stage renal failure. In cirrhosis, urinary sodium is not a reliable guide to the development of ATN, as fractional sodium excretion may stay below 1 percent, due to the gradual worsening of renal ischaemia. Other causes may include glomerular disease secondary to Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C,  drug toxicity (notably gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy."
4514,What causes Hepatorenal syndrome?,"Hepatorenal syndrome occurs when there is a decrease in kidney function in a person with a liver disorder. Because less urine is removed from the body, nitrogen-containing waste products build up in the bloodstream (azotemia)."
4515,Who is at highest risk for Hepatorenal syndrome ?,"The disorder occurs in up to 10% of patients hospitalized with liver failure. It is caused by the built-up effects of liver damage and kidney failure in people with:

Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: Clinical surveys has show the close relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.
Family history of colorectal cancer: The reasons are not clear in all cases. Inherited genes, shared environmental factors and some combination of these may contribute to the development of colorectal cancer.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): FAP is caused by changes (mutations) in the APC gene that a person inherits from his or her parents. About 1% of all colorectal cancers are due to FAP.
Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC): Clinical survey suggest that the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer in people with this condition may be as high as 70% to 80%.

Lifestyle-related factors such as diets high in red meats and poor in vegetables and fruits, physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol abuse, obesity and so on.
Racial and ethnic background: Among all racial groups in the United States, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates to develope colorectal cancer. The reason is not yet clear.
Age: Both youth and aged can develop colorectal cancer. But the chances increase markedly after age 50."
4520,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of colorectal cancer develop. If one emerges the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe abdominal pain, severe abdominal distension, and stopping defecation: The reason of a person with colorectal cancer appears these symptoms is mostly because of intestinal obstruction caused by lumps. This is the results of lumps growth on rectum wall. A surgery will be done urgently.
Defecation with a lot of blood: This is the result of cancer invading the vessels of rectum or colon walls. An abundant of blood loss may lead to shock and death. You need to go to hospital as soon as possible."
4521,What to expect if I have Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of colorectal cancer varies widely. For patients whose tumor is caught early may often be curable. It depends on the following:

Many other factors such as a person's age, overall health, location of the cancer in the body, and the cancer response to treatment can also affect a person’s outlook. The outlook for each person is specific to their circumstances. Throat cancers may be cured in most patients if they are detected early. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, some patients may be cured. If the cancer has spread (metastasized) to parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable and treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life. Patients generally need therapy to help with speech and swallowing after the treatment. If the person is not able to swallow, a feeding tube will be needed. The recurrence risk in throat cancer is highest during the first 2 to 3 years of diagnosis. Regular follow-up after the diagnosis and treatment is very important to increase the chances of survival."

Other causes of indigestion are:
Gallstones Gastritis (when the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed or swollen) Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Ulcers (stomach or intestinal ulcer) Use of certain drugs such as antibiotics, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
4544,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Indigestion ?,"Indigestion is a common problem, usually not a sign of a more serious health problem, unless other symptoms also occur, such as weight loss or trouble swallowing. Rarely, the discomfort of a heart attack is mistaken for indigestion.
Seek immediate medical help if your symptoms include jaw pain, chest pain, back pain, profuse sweating, anxiety, or a feeling of impending doom. These are possible heart attack symptoms.
Call your health care provider if:

Epididymitis (patient information) can also present with similar symptoms."
4547,What causes Indirect inguinal hernia?,"Indirect inguinal hernia's are congenital and is caused by failure of the inguinal ring to close just after birth, leadving a weakness in the abdominal wall."
4548,Who is at highest risk for Indirect inguinal hernia ?,Premature infants are especially at risk for indirect inguinal hernias because there is less time for the inguinal canal to close. Males are also at a higher risk for developing indirect inguinal hernias because of the way they develop in the womb.
4549,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Indirect inguinal hernia ?,Contact your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms associated with an indirect inguinal hernia.
4550,What to expect if I have Indirect inguinal hernia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Surgery for inguinal hernia is usually done on an outpatient basis.

Complications from inguinal hernia surgery are rare and can include general anesthesia complications, hernia recurrence, bleeding, wound infection, painful scar, and injury to internal organs."
4551,What are the symptoms of Intussusception?,"The first sign of intussusception is usually sudden, loud crying caused by abdominal pain. The pain is colicky and not continuous (intermittent), but it comes back often, increasing in both intensity and duration. An infant with severe abdominal pain may draw the knees to the chest while crying.
Other symptoms include:
Bloody, mucus-like bowel movement, sometimes called a ""currant jelly"" stool Fever Shock (pale color, lethargy, sweating) Stool mixed with blood and mucus Vomiting"
4552,What are the causes of Intussusception?,"Intussusception is caused by part of the intestine being pulled inward into itself. This can block the passage of food through the intestine. If the blood supply is cut off, the segment of intestine pulled inside can die.
The pressure created by the walls of the intestine pressing together causes: Decreased blood flow Irritation Swelling
The intestine can die, and the patient can have significant bleeding. If a hole occurs, infection, shock, and dehydration can take place very rapidly.
The cause of intussusception is not known, although viral infections may be responsible in some cases. Sometimes a lymph node, polyp, or tumor can trigger the problem. The older the child, the more likely such a trigger will be found."
4553,Who is at risk for Intussusception?,"Risk factors:
Age: Intussusception can affect both children and adults, although most cases occur in children ages 6 months - 2 years Gender: It affects boys four times as often as girls"
4554,How to know you have Intussusception (Diagnosis)?,"Your doctor will perform a thorough examination, which may reveal a mass in the abdomen. There may also be signs of dehydration or shock.
Tests may include:
Abdominal x-ray Air or contrast enema"
4555,What are the symptoms of Irritable bowel syndrome ?,"Symptoms range from mild to severe, however most people have mild symptoms. IBS symptoms may be worse in patients with underlying stress or mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, but it is important to understand that these conditions do not cause IBS. Symptoms may include:
Abdominal distention Abdominal fullness, gas, bloating Abdominal pain or tenderness that:
Comes and goes Goes away after a bowel movement Occurs after meals
Chronic and frequent constipation, usually accompanied by pain Chronic and frequent diarrhea, usually accompanied by pain Emotional distress Depression Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting"
4556,What are the causes of Irritable bowel syndrome ?,"Researchers have yet to discover any specific cause for IBS. One theory is that people who suffer from IBS have a colon, or large intestine, that is particularly sensitive and reactive to certain foods and stress. The immune system, which fights infection, may also be involved.
Normal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a person who has IBS. It can be spasmodic or can even stop working temporarily. Spasms are sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go. The lining of the colon called the epithelium, which is affected by the immune and nervous systems, regulates the flow of fluids in and out of the colon. In IBS, the epithelium appears to work properly. However, when the contents inside the colon move too quickly, the colon loses its ability to absorb fluids. The result is too much fluid in the stool. In other people, the movement inside the colon is too slow, which causes extra fluid to be absorbed. As a result, a person develops constipation. A person’s colon may respond strongly to stimuli such as certain foods or stress that would not bother most people. Recent research has reported that serotonin is linked with normal gastrointestinal (GI) functioning. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or chemical, that delivers messages from one part of your body to another. Ninety-five percent of the serotonin in your body is located in the GI tract, and the other 5 percent is found in the brain. Cells that line the inside of the bowel work as transporters and carry the serotonin out of the GI tract. People with IBS, however, have diminished receptor activity, causing abnormal levels of serotonin to exist in the GI tract. As a result, they experience problems with bowel movement, motility, and sensation—having more sensitive pain receptors in their GI tract. Researchers have reported that IBS may be caused by a bacterial infection in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies show that people who have had gastroenteritis sometimes develop IBS, otherwise called post-infectious IBS. Researchers have also found very mild celiac disease in some people with symptoms similar to IBS. People with celiac disease cannot digest gluten, a substance found in wheat, rye, and barley. People with celiac disease cannot eat these foods without becoming very sick because their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. A blood test can determine whether celiac disease may be present."
4557,Who is at highest risk for Irritable bowel syndrome ?,"Risk factors for IBS:
Gender: females are at higher risk than males Age: people younger than 35 are at greater risk"
4558,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Irritable bowel syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome or if you notice a persistent change in your bowel habits.
4559,What to expect if I have Irritable bowel syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Irritable bowel syndrome may be a life-long condition, but symptoms can often be improved or relieved through treatment."
4560,What are the symptoms of Lactose intolerance?,"Symptoms often occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after having milk products. Symptoms may be worse when you consume large amounts.
Symptoms include:
Abdominal bloating Abdominal cramps Diarrhea Gas (flatulence) Nausea"
4561,What causes Lactose intolerance?,".Babies' bodies make the lactase enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk.
Babies born too early (premature) sometimes have lactose intolerance. Children who were born at full term often do not show signs of the problem before they are 3 years old.
Lactose intolerance is very common in adults. It is rarely dangerous. About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20.
In white people, lactose intolerance often develops in children older than age 5. This is the age when our bodies may stop making lactase. In African Americans, the problem can occur as early as age 2. The condition is very common among adults with Asian, African, or Native American heritage. It is less common in people of northern or western European background, but still may occur.
An illness that involves or injures your small intestine may cause less of the lactase enzyme to be made. Treatment of these illnesses may improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance. These may include:
Surgery of the small intestine Infections in the small intestine (this is most often seen in children) Diseases that damage the small intestines, such as celiac sprue or crohn disease
Babies may be born with a genetic defect and are not able to make any of the lactase enzyme."
4562,Who is at highest risk for Lactose intolerance ?,"Between 30 and 50 million Americans are lactose intolerant and certain ethnic and racial populations are more affected than others. Up to 80 percent of African Americans, 80 to 100 percent of American Indians, and 90 to 100 percent of Asian Americans are lactose intolerant. The condition is least common among people of northern European descent.
Babies that are born prematurely are also more likely to be lactose intolerant, because lactase levels do not increase until the third trimester of a woman’s pregnancy."
4563,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Lactose intolerance ?,"Lactose intolerance is not serious.
Call your provider if:
You have an infant younger than 2 or 3 years old who has symptoms of lactose intolerance. Your child is growing slowly or not gaining weight. You or your child has symptoms of lactose intolerance and you need information about food substitutes. Your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment. You develop new symptoms."
4564,What to expect if I have Lactose intolerance  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Symptoms most often go away when you remove milk, other dairy products, and other sources of lactose from your diet. Without dietary changes, infants or children may have growth problems."

4571,What causes nausea and vomiting?,"Many common problems may cause nausea and vomiting:
Food allergies Infections of the stomach or bowels, such as the ""stomach flu"" or food poisoning Leaking of stomach contents (food or liquid) upwards (also called gastroesophageal reflux or GERD) Medications or medical treatments, such as cancer chemotherapy or radiation treatment Migraine headaches Morning sickness during pregnancy Seasickness or motion sickness Severe pain, such as with kidney stones
Nausea and vomiting may also be early warning signs of more serious medical problems, such as:
Appendicitis Blockage in the intestines Cancer or a tumor Ingesting a drug or poison, especially by children Ulcers in the lining of the stomach or small intestine"
4572,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nausea and vomiting ?,"Call 911 or go to an emergency room if:
You think vomiting is from poisoning. You notice blood or dark, coffee-colored material in the vomit.
Call a health care provider right away or seek medical care if you or another person has:
Been vomiting for longer than 24 hours. Been unable to keep any fluids down for 12 hours or more. Headache or stiff neck. Not urinated for 8 or more hours. Severe stomach or belly pain. Vomited three or more times in 1 day.
Signs of dehydration include:
Crying without tears. Dry mouth. Increased thirst. Eyes that appear sunken. Skin changes -- for example, if you touch or squeeze the skin, it doesn't bounce back the way it usually does. Urinating less often or having dark yellow urine."
4573,What are the symptoms of Neonatal jaundice?,"The main symptom is a yellow color of the skin.
The yellow color is best seen right after gently pressing a finger onto the skin. The color sometimes begins on the face and then moves down to the chest, belly area, legs, and soles of the feet.
Sometimes, infants with significant jaundice have extreme tiredness and poor feeding."
4574,What causes Neonatal jaundice?,"Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is created in the body during the normal recycling of old red blood cells. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.
Before birth, the placenta (the organ that nourishes the developing baby) removes the bilirubin from the infant so that it can be processed by the mother's liver. Immediately after birth, the baby's own liver begins to take over the job, but this can take time. Therefore, bilirubin levels in an infant are normally a little higher after birth.
High levels of bilirubin in the body can cause the skin to look yellow. This is called jaundice."
4575,What are the types of neonatal jaundice?,"Jaundice is present to some degree in most newborns, and is called physiological jaundice. It usually appears between day 2 and 3, peaks between days 2 and 4, and clears by 2 weeks. Physiological jaundice usually causes no problems.
Other types of jaundice that usually cause no harm include:
Breast milk jaundice is probably caused by factors in the breast milk that slow the rate at which the liver breaks down bilirubin. Such jaundice appears in some healthy, breastfed babies after day 7 of life, and usually peaks during weeks 2 and 3. It may last at low levels for a month or more. Breastfeeding jaundice is seen in breastfed babies in the first week of life, especially in babies who are not nursing often enough. Breastfeeding jaundice is different than breast milk jaundice.
Babies who are born too early (premature) are more likely to develop jaundice than full-term babies.
Conditions that increase the number of red blood cells that need to be broken down, and can cause more severe newborn jaundice:
Abnormal blood cell shapes Blood type mismatch between the mother and the baby Bleeding underneath the scalp (cephalohematoma) caused by a difficult delivery Higher levels of red blood cells, which is more common in small-for-gestational-age babies and some twins Infection Lack (deficiency) of certain important enzymes
Conditions that make it harder for the baby's body to remove bilirubin may also lead to more severe jaundice:
Certain medications Congenital infections, such as rubella, syphilis, and others Diseases that affect the liver or biliary tract, such as cystic fibrosis or hepatitis Hypoxia Infections (such as sepsis) Many different genetic or inherited disorders"
4576,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neonatal jaundice ?,"All babies should be seen by a health care provider in the first 5 days of life to check for jaundice.
Those who spend less than 24 hours in a hospital should be seen by age 72 hours. Infants sent home between 24 and 48 hours should be seen again by age 96 hours. Infants sent home between 48 and 72 hours should be seen again by age 120 hours.
Jaundice is an emergency if the baby has a fever, has become listless, or is not feeding well. Jaundice may be dangerous in high-risk newborns.
Jaundice is generally NOT dangerous in term, otherwise healthy newborns. Call the infant's health care provider if:
Jaundice is severe (the skin is bright yellow) Jaundice continues to increase after the newborn visit, lasts longer than 2 weeks, or other symptoms develop The feet, especially the soles, are yellow"
4577,What to expect if I have Neonatal jaundice  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Usually newborn jaundice is not harmful. For most babies, jaundice usually gets better without treatment within 1 to 2 weeks.
Very high levels of bilirubin can damage the brain. This is called kernicterus. However, the condition is almost always diagnosed before levels become high enough to cause this damage.
For babies who need treatment, the treatment is usually effective."
4578,What are the symptoms of Odynophagia?,"“Odynophagia” is the medical term for painful swallowing. Pain can be felt in your mouth, throat, or esophagus. You may experience painful swallowing when drinking or eating food. Sometimes swallowing difficulties, known as dysphagia, can accompany the pain, but odynophagia is often a condition of its own."
4579,What causes Odynophagia?,"Odynophagia may sometimes be related to a minor condition, such as the common cold. In such cases, painful swallowing will resolve on its own with time.
Chronic painful swallowing may be related to another underlying cause. There are several medical conditions that can cause odynophagia. Among the possibilities are:
Cancer: Sometimes chronic painful swallowing is an early sign of esophageal cancer. This is caused by tumors that develop in your esophagus. Esophageal cancer may develop from long-term smoking, alcohol abuse, or persistent heartburn. It can also be hereditary. Candida infection: This is a type of fungal (yeast) infection that may occur in your mouth. It can spread and cause esophageal symptoms like painful swallowing. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): This develops from the lower sphincter in the esophagus not closing properly. As a result, stomach acid leaks back into the esophagus. You might have GERD if you experience painful swallowing along with other symptoms, such as heartburn or chest pain. HIV: Esophagus problems occur often in people with HIV. According to the AIDS Education and Treatment Center Program, Candida infection is the most common cause. Sometimes antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV result in acid reflux. This can then lead to other symptoms like odynophagia. Ulcers: These are sores that can occur in your mouth, throat, or esophagus, as well as your stomach. Ulcers may also be caused by untreated GERD. The long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), can increase your risk of ulcers.
Odynophagia can also be caused by medical treatments, such as radiation therapy for cancer. Some prescription medications may also lead to painful swallowing."
4580,Who is at highest risk for Odynophagia ?,"The following are risk factors for dysphagia: Aging. Due to natural aging and normal wear and tear on the esophagus and a greater risk of certain conditions, such as stroke or Parkinson's disease, older adults are at higher risk of swallowing difficulties."
4581,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Odynophagia ?,"If your doctor doesn’t detect any underlying medical issue, painful swallowing might resolve on its own with time. This is common after having a cold or severe allergies. Talk to your doctor if you have recurring discomfort with swallowing."
4582,What to expect if I have Odynophagia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When caught and treated early, many underlying health conditions can improve, along with painful swallowing. The key is to call your doctor if you experience prolonged symptoms.
Left untreated, odynophagia and its underlying cause can lead to further complications. Weight loss may also occur with odynophagia. You may eat less due to the discomforts associated with swallowing. This can lead to other health concerns, such as anemia, dehydration, and malnutrition. If you find this is the case, see your doctor right away."
4583,What are the symptoms of Pancreatic pseudocyst?,"Symptoms can occur within days to months after an attack of pancreatitis, and include:
Bloating of the abdomen Constant pain or deep ache in the abdomen, which may also be felt in the back Difficulty eating and digesting food"
4584,What are the causes of Pancreatic pseudocyst?,"Pancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of severe, acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is sudden swelling (inflammation) of the pancreas. The cyst happens when the ducts (tubes) in the pancreas are damaged by the inflammation or swelling that occurs during pancreatitis.
A pancreatic pseudocyst may also occur after trauma to the abdomen, and in someone with chronic pancreatitis."
4585,Who is at risk for Pancreatic pseudocyst?,"Patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis Patients who endure some type of trauma to the abdomen, especially small children"
4586,How to know you have Pancreatic pseudocyst?,"The health care provider may palpate your abdomen to feel for a pseudocyst, which feels like a mass in the middle or left upper abdomen.
Tests that may help diagnose pancreatic pseudocyst include:
Abdominal CT scan Abdominal MRI Abdominal ultrasound"
4587,What are the symptoms of Peritonitis?,"Abdominal distention Abdominal pain or tenderness Fever Fluid in the abdomen Inability to pass feces or gas Low urine output Nausea and vomiting Point tenderness Thirst
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease include:
Cloudy dialysis fluid (if undergoing peritoneal dialysis) Nausea and vomiting Shaking chills Signs of shock"
4588,What causes Peritonitis?,"A collection of pus in the abdomen, called an intra-abdominal abscess, may cause peritonitis."
4589,Who is at highest risk for Peritonitis ?,"Risk factors for liver disease include alcoholic cirrhosis and other diseases that lead to cirrhosis, such as viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B or C). Spontaneous peritonitis also occurs in patients who are on dialysis for kidney failure."
4590,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Peritonitis ?,Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of peritonitis.
4591,What to expect if I have Peritonitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, patients usually do well. Without treatment, the outcome is usually poor. However, in some cases, patients do poorly even with prompt and appropriate treatment. If properly treated, typical cases of surgically correctable peritonitis (e.g. perforated peptic ulcer, appendicitis, and diverticulitis) have a mortality rate of about <10% in otherwise healthy patients, which rises to about 40% in the elderly, and/or in those with significant underlying illness, as well as in cases that present late (after 48h). If untreated, generalized peritonitis is almost always fatal."
4592,What are the symptoms of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome?,"Symptoms of PJS are:
Brownish or bluish-gray spots on the lips, gums, inner lining of the mouth, and skin Clubbed fingers or toes Cramping pain in the belly area Dark freckles on and around the lips of a newborn Blood in the stool that can be seen with the naked eye (sometimes) Vomiting"
4593,What causes Peutz-Jeghers syndrome?,"It is not known how many people are affected by PJS. The National Institutes of Health estimates that it affects about 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 births.
There are 2 types of PJS:
Familial PJS may be due to a mutation in a gene called STK11. The genetic defect can be inherited through families as an autosomal dominant trait. That means if 1 of your parents has this type of PJS, you have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and having the disease. Sporadic PJS is not passed down through families and appears unrelated to an STK11 gene mutation."
4594,Who is at highest risk for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ?,People with genetic mutations are at highest risk such as BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations
4595,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ?,Call for an appointment with your provider if you or your baby has symptoms of this condition. Severe abdominal pain may be a sign of an emergency condition such as intussusception.
4596,What to expect if I have Peutz-Jeghers syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"There may be a high risk for these polyps becoming cancerous. Some studies link PJS with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast, uterus, and ovaries."
4597,What are the symptoms of Primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"The main symptoms of PSC include
itching fatigue yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes
An infection in the bile ducts can cause chills and fever. PSC progresses slowly, so a person can have the disease for years before symptoms develop.
Other symptoms may include:
Enlarged liver Enlarged spleen General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) Indigestion Loss of appetite"
4598,What causes Primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"The causes of PSC are not known. Genes, immune system problems, bacteria, and viruses may play roles in the development of the disease."
4599,Who is at highest risk for Primary sclerosing cholangitis ?,PSC is linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). About three out of four people with PSC have a type of IBD called ulcerative colitis. Most people with PSC are adults but the disease also occurs in children. The average age at diagnosis is 40. PSC is more common in men than women. Having family members with PSC may increase a person’s risk for developing PSC.
4600,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Primary sclerosing cholangitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have jaundice and itching that do not go away.
4601,What to expect if I have Primary sclerosing cholangitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well patients do varies. The disease tends to get worse over time and most patients develop:
Biliary cirrhosis Liver failure Persistent jaundice
Some patients develop recurrent infections of the bile ducts. Some patients have worsening chronic liver disease with ascites and varices.
Patients with this condition have an increased risk of developing cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma), and should be checked on a regular basis (usually each year) with liver scans and blood tests."
4602,What are the symptoms of Pseudomyxoma peritonei?,"Symptoms of pseudomyxoma peritonei include:
Increase in abdominal girth Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Bloating"
4603,What causes Pseudomyxoma peritonei?,"There are no established causes for pseudomyxoma peritonei, it is shown in studies that pseudomyxoma mostly arises from the tumor of the appendix, and less commonly from ovary and colon."
4604,Who is at highest risk for Pseudomyxoma peritonei ?,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.1 person per 100,000 people and slightly is seen more in female and the average age at diagnosis is 50 years old."
4605,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pseudomyxoma peritonei ?,"Patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei usually are asymptomatic at the beginning but any increase in abdominal girth, bloating, the sensation of fullness, abdominal pain warrants further evaluation and primary care visit is necessary."
4606,What to expect if I have Pseudomyxoma peritonei  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Majority of patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei experience good prognosis with exception of those having high-grade neoplasm.
4607,What are the symptoms of Rectal prolapse?,"The main symptom is a reddish-colored mass that sticks out from the opening of the anus, especially following a bowel movement. The lining of the rectal tissue may be visible and may bleed slightly."
4608,What causes Rectal prolapse?,"Rectal Prolapse is often associated with the following conditions:
Anatomical abnormalities Perineal nerve injury (due to descent of the pelvic floor, vaginal delivery and excessive straining during defection) Altered colonic motility"
4609,Who is at highest risk for Rectal prolapse ?,"Elderly patients Female gender
Increase intra-abdominal pressure such as straining, constipation or chronic coughing Obstetrical history (vaginal delivery, previous obstetrical trauma) Hormonal status (onset of menopause) Patients with any of the associated conditions listed above"
4610,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rectal prolapse ?,Call your health care provider promptly if there is a rectal prolapse.
4611,What to expect if I have Rectal prolapse  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treating the underlying condition usually cures the problem. In otherwise-healthy elderly patients with recurrent rectal prolapse, surgery can repair anatomic problems that predispose them to prolapse."
4612,What are the symptoms of Reye's syndrome?,"Reye syndrome often begins with vomiting, which lasts for many hours. The vomiting is quickly followed by irritable and aggressive behavior. As the condition gets worse, the child may be unable to stay awake and alert.
Other symptoms of Reye syndrome:
Confusion Lethargy Loss of consciousness or coma Mental changes Nausea and vomiting Seizures Unusual placement of arms and legs (decerebrate posture) -- the arms are extended straight and turned toward the body, the legs are held straight, and the toes are pointed downward
Other symptoms that can occur with this disorder include:
Double vision Hearing loss Muscle function loss or paralysis of the arms or legs Speech difficulties Weakness in the arms or legs"
4613,What causes Reye's syndrome?,"Reye's syndrome is of unknown cause.
Causes for similar symptoms include
Various inborn metabolic disorders Viral encephalitis Drug overdose or poisoning Head trauma Hepatic failure due to other causes Meningitis Renal failure"
4614,Who is at highest risk for Reye%27s syndrome ?,"Reye syndrome is most often seen in children ages 4 - 12. Most cases that occur with chickenpox are in children ages 5 - 9. Cases that occur with the flu (influenzae type B) are usually in children ages 10 - 14.
Children with Reye syndrome get sick very suddenly. Reye syndrome usually follows an upper respiratory infection (URI) or chickenpox by about 1 week."
4615,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Reye%27s syndrome ?,"Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) immediately if your child has confusion, lethargy, or other mental changes."
4616,What to expect if I have Reye%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Documented cases of Reye’s syndrome in adults are rare. The recovery of adults with the syndrome is generally complete, with liver and brain function returning to normal within two weeks of the illness. In children, however, mild to severe permanent brain damage is possible, especially in infants. Over thirty percent of the cases reported in the United States from 1981 through 1997 resulted in fatality."
4617,What are the symptoms of short bowel syndrome?,"Diarrhea Fatigue Pale, greasy stools Swelling (edema), especially of the legs Very foul-smelling stools Weight loss"
4618,What causes short bowel syndrome?,"When areas of the small intestine are removed by surgery, or they are missing due to a birth defect (congenital defect), there may not be enough surface area left in the remaining bowel to absorb enough nutrients from food.
This condition is likely to develop when one-half or more of the bowel is removed during surgery."
4619,Who is at highest risk for Short bowel syndrome ?,"Risk factors include diseases of the small intestine that may require surgery, such as Crohn's disease. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a common cause of short bowel syndrome in infants."
4620,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Short bowel syndrome ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of short bowel syndrome, especially if you recently had bowel surgery."
4621,What to expect if I have Short bowel syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The condition may improve over time if it occurs as a result of surgery. There may be a gradual improvement in nutrient absorption.
4622,What are the symptoms of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?,"The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. These include red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues; white blood cells, which fight infection; and platelets, which are necessary for normal blood clotting. In Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, the bone marrow malfunctions and does not make some or all types of white blood cells. A shortage of neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell, causes a condition called neutropenia. Most people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome have at least occasional episodes of neutropenia, which makes them more vulnerable to infections such as pneumonia, recurrent ear infections (otitis media), and skin infections. Less commonly, bone marrow abnormalities lead to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which causes fatigue and weakness, or a reduction in the amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can result in easy bruising and abnormal bleeding.
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome also affects the pancreas, which is an organ that plays an essential role in digestion. One of this organ's main functions is to produce enzymes that help break down and use the nutrients from food. In most infants with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, the pancreas does not produce enough of these enzymes. This condition is known as pancreatic insufficiency. Infants with pancreatic insufficiency have trouble digesting food and absorbing nutrients that are needed for growth. As a result, they often have fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea); are slow to grow and gain weight (failure to thrive); and experience malnutrition. Pancreatic insufficiency often improves with age in people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.
Skeletal abnormalities are another common feature of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Many affected individuals have problems with bone formation and growth, most often affecting the hips and knees. Low bone density is also frequently associated with this condition. Some infants are born with a narrow rib cage and short ribs, which can cause life-threatening problems with breathing. The combination of skeletal abnormalities and slow growth results in short stature in most people with this disorder.
The complications of this condition can affect several other parts of the body, including the liver, heart, endocrine system (which produces hormones), eyes, teeth, and skin. Additionally, studies suggest that Shwachman-Diamond syndrome may be associated with delayed speech and the delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking."
4623,What causes Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome occurs when the bone marrow malfunctions and does not make some or all types of white blood cells.
The disorder has also been associated with pancreatic insufficiency, where the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes."
4624,Who is at risk for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is a genetic disorder, so a person with a family history of the syndrome is at risk."
4625,How do people inherit Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?,"This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."
4626,How common is Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?,Researchers are not sure how common Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is. Several hundred cases have been reported in scientific studies.
4627,What genes are related to Shwachman-Diamond syndrome?,"Mutations in the SBDS gene have been identified in about 90 percent of people with the characteristic features of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown, although it is active in cells throughout the body. Researchers suspect that the SBDS protein may play a role in processing RNA (a molecule that is a chemical cousin of DNA). This protein may also be involved in building ribosomes, which are cellular structures that process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins. It is unclear how SBDS mutations lead to the major signs and symptoms of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.
In cases where no SBDS mutation is found, the cause of this disorder is unknown."
4628,What are the symptoms of Splenomegaly?,"Symptoms of splenomegaly include:
Hiccups Inability to eat a large meal Pain on the upper left side of the abdomen"
4629,What causes Splenomegaly?,"Infections Bacterial infections (subacute bacterial endocarditis) Cat scratch disease Infectious mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus) Other viral infections (Hepatitis) Parasitic infections (Malaria, Kala Azar)
Diseases involving the liver Biliary atresia Cirrhosis (alcoholic cirrhosis) Cystic fibrosis Portal hypertension Portal vein obstruction Sclerosing cholangitis
Blood diseases Hemoglobinopathies Hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency Idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia Hereditary spherocytosis Immune hemolytic anemia Myelodysplastic syndrome Polycythemia vera Thalassemia
Cancer Hodgkin's disease Leukemia Lymphoma
Autoimmune causes Felty syndrome (Rheumatoid Arthritis with splenomegaly and neutropenia) Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus) Sarcoidosis Sickle cell splenic crisis"
4630,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Splenomegaly ?,"There are usually no symptoms from an enlarged spleen. However, some people have pain in the left upper section of the belly area. You should seek medical help right away if it is severe or gets worse when you take a deep breath."
4631,What are the symptoms of Ulcerative colitis?,"The most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis are abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Patients also may experience:
Anemia Fatigue Weight loss Loss of appetite Rectal bleeding Loss of body fluids and nutrients Skin lesions Joint pain Growth failure (specifically in children)
About half of the people diagnosed with ulcerative colitis have mild symptoms. Others suffer frequent fevers, bloody diarrhea, nausea, and severe abdominal cramps. Ulcerative colitis may also cause problems such as arthritis, inflammation of the eye, liver disease, and osteoporosis. It is not known why these problems occur outside the colon. Scientists think these complications may be the result of inflammation triggered by the immune system. Some of these problems go away when the colitis is treated."
4632,What causes Ulcerative colitis?,"Many theories exist about what causes ulcerative colitis. People with ulcerative colitis have abnormalities of the immune system, but doctors do not know whether these abnormalities are a cause or a result of the disease. The body’s immune system is believed to react abnormally to the bacteria in the digestive tract.
Ulcerative colitis is not caused by emotional distress or sensitivity to certain foods or food products, but these factors may trigger symptoms in some people. The stress of living with ulcerative colitis may also contribute to a worsening of symptoms."
4633,Who is at highest risk for Ulcerative colitis ?,"Risk factors include a family history of ulcerative colitis, or Jewish ancestry. The incidence is 10 to 15 out of 100,000 people. It may affect any age group, although there are peaks at ages 15 - 30 and then again at ages 50 - 70. It affects men and women equally and appears to run in families, with reports of up to 20 percent of people with ulcerative colitis having a family member or relative with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A higher incidence of ulcerative colitis is seen in caucasians and people of Jewish descent."
4634,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ulcerative colitis ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop persistent abdominal pain, new or increased bleeding, persistent fever, or other symptoms of ulcerative colitis.
Call your health care provider if you have ulcerative colitis and your symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms develop."
4635,What to expect if I have Ulcerative colitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The course of the disease generally varies. Ulcerative colitis may be inactive and then get worse over a period of years. Sometimes ulcerative colitis can progress quickly. A permanent and complete cure is unusual.
The risk of colon cancer increases in each decade after ulcerative colitis is diagnosed."
4636,What are the symptoms of Umbilical hernia?,"A hernia can vary in width from less than 1 centimeter to more than 5 centimeters.
There is a soft swelling over the belly button that often bulges when the baby sits up, cries, or strains. The bulge may be flat when the infant lies on the back and is quiet."
4637,What are the causes of Umbilical hernia?,An umbilical hernia in an infant occurs when the muscle through which blood vessels pass to feed the developing fetus doesn't close completely.
4638,Who is at risk for Umbilical hernia?,Infants African Americans Patients with the following pre-existing diseases: Mucopolysaccharide storage disease Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Down syndrome
4639,How to know you have Umbilical hernia?,The doctor can find the hernia during a physical exam.
4640,What are the symptoms of VIPoma ?,"Abdominal pain and cramping Diarrhea (watery, and often in large amounts) Flushing or redness of the face Nausea Weight loss"
4641,What causes VIPoma ?,"VIPoma causes cells in the pancreas to produce high levels of a hormone called vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). This hormone increases secretions from the intestines and relaxes some of the smooth muscles in the GI system.
The cause is not known."
4642,Who is at highest risk for VIPoma ?,"VIPomas are usually diagnosed in adults, most commonly at age 50. Women are more likely to be affected than men. This cancer is rare, affecting an estimated 1 in 10 million people per year."
4643,When to seek urgent medical care when I have VIPoma ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of VIPoma"
4644,What to expect if I have VIPoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Surgery can usually cure VIPomas. However, in one-third to one-half of patients, the tumor has spread by the time of diagnosis and cannot be cured."
4645,What are the symptoms of Whipple's disease?,"Symptoms usually start slowly. Joint pain is the most common initial symptom. After that, often several years later, symptoms of gastrointestinal infection develop. Other symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain Diarrhea Fever Gray to brown skin color Joint pain in the ankles, knees, elbows, fingers, or other areas Memory loss Personality changes Weight loss"
4646,What causes Whipple's disease?,"Whipple's disease is caused by bacteria named Tropheryma whipplei. It can affect any system of the body, but occurs most often in the small intestine. Lesions appear on the wall of the small intestine and thicken the tissue. The villi —tiny, finger-like protrusions from the wall that help absorb nutrients —are damaged."
4647,Who is at highest risk for Whipple%27s disease ?,"Although risk factors for Whipple's disease are unknown, the disorder mainly affects middle-aged white men."
4648,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Whipple%27s disease ?,"Call your healthcare provider if you have persistent abdominal pain and diarrhea.
If you are being treated for Whipple's disease, call your healthcare provider if:
Symptoms worsen or do not improve Symptoms reappear New symptoms develop"
4649,What are the symptoms of Wilson%27s disease ?,"Abnormal posture of arms and legs Confusion or delirium Dementia Difficulty moving arms and legs, stiffness Difficulty walking (ataxia) Emotional or behavioral changes Enlargement of the abdomen (abdominal distention) Personality changes Phobias, distress (neuroses) Slow movements Slow or decreased movement and expressions of the face Speech impairment Tremors of the arms or hands Uncontrollable movement Unpredictable and jerky movement Vomiting blood Weakness Yellow skin (jaundice) or yellow color of the white of the eye (icterus)"
4650,Who is at highest risk for Wilson%27s disease ?,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder. If both parents carry an abnormal gene for Wilson's disease, there is a 25% chance in each pregnancy that the child will have the disorder.
Wilson's disease causes the body to take in and keep too much copper. The copper deposits in the liver, brain, kidneys, and the eyes. The deposits of copper cause tissue damage, death of the tissues, and scarring, which causes the affected organs to stop working correctly.
This condition is most common in eastern Europeans, Sicilians, and southern Italians, but may occur in any group. Wilson's disease typically appears in people under 40 years old. In children, the symptoms begin to show by age 4."
4651,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Wilson%27s disease ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of Wilson's disease. Call a genetic counselor if you have a history of Wilson's disease in your family and you are planning to have children.
4652,What to expect if I have Wilson%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Lifelong treatment is needed to control Wilson's disease. The disorder may cause fatal effects, especially loss of liver function and toxic effects of copper on the nervous system. In cases where the disorder is not fatal, symptoms may be disabling."
4653,What are the symptoms of Aarskog-Scott syndrome?,"Symptoms of Aarksog-Scott syndrome:
Distinct facial features such as: a downward slant to the eyes, hairline with a "" widow's peak, a long area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), poorly developed midportion of the face and overall rounding of the face, small nose with nostrils tipped forward, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism) with droopy eyelids, and a wide groove above the upper lip, crease below the lower lip Other body features: belly button that sticks out, bulge in the groin or scrotum (inguinal hernia) or soft out-pouching around the belly button (umbilical hernia), delayed dental development, mildly sunken chest (pectus excavatum), mild to moderate short stature which may not be obvious until the child is 1 - 3 years old, short fingers and toes with mild webbing (syndactyly), single crease in palm of hand (simian crease), small, broad hands and feet with short fingers (brachydactyly) and curved-in 5th finger (fifth finger clinodactyly), and top portion of the ear folded over slightly of the ear folded over slightly Reproductive development issues: delayed sexual maturation, shawl scrotum in which the scrotum surrounds the penis; less often, males have undescended testiles (cryptorchidism) Mild to moderate neurological delay
Some people with Aarskog-Scott syndrome are born with more serious abnormalities, such as heart defects or a cleft lip with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)."
4654,What causes Aarskog-Scott syndrome?,"Aarskog syndrome is a genetic disorder. It affects mainly males, but females may have a milder form. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in a gene called "" faciogenital dysplasia "" (FGDY1). Only about 20 percent of people with this disorder have identifiable mutations in the FGD1 gene. The cause of Aarskog-Scott syndrome in other affected individuals is unknown."
4655,Who is at highest risk for Aarskog-Scott syndrome?,"Aarskog-Scott syndrome is a genetic disorder. Anyone with a family history of Aarskog-Scott syndrome is at risk. Aarskog-Scott syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause Aarskog-Scott syndrome. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. Females who carry one altered copy of the FGD1 gene may show mild signs of the condition, such as hypertelorism, short stature, or a widow's peak hairline. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons."
4656,How to know you have Aarskog-Scott syndrome?,Genetic testing for mutations in the FGDY1 gene X-rays
4657,What are the symptoms of Achondroplasia?,"All people with achondroplasia have short stature. The average height of an adult male with achondroplasia is 131 centimeters (4 feet, 4 inches), and the average height for adult females is 124 centimeters (4 feet, 1 inch).
Characteristic features of achondroplasia include:
Bowed legs Diminished stature A trunk of average size Arms of diminished length, particuarly the upper arms (termed rhizomelic shortening) Thighs of diminished length (termed rhizomelic shortening) The range of motion of the elbows is limited The head is enlarged, and the forehead is prominent The fingers and toes are of diminished in length Spinal stenosis may be present Kyphosis (convex curvature of the spine) may be present Lordosis (concave curvature of the spine) may be present Normal intelligence is generally present"
4658,What causes Achondroplasia?,"Mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause achondroplasia. The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Two specific mutations in the FGFR3 gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia. Researchers believe that these mutations cause the protein to be overly active, which interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth seen with this disorder.
Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern so one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In the majority of cases, the parents do not carry the mutation, and the mutation occurs spontaneously in the child.
Individuals who inherit two altered copies of this gene typically have very severe problems with bone growth, and are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure."
4659,Who is at highest risk for Achondroplasia ?,"A person is most likely to be affected by achondroplasia if one or both of his parents are affected by it. In so far as achondroplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder (if either parent transmits a copy of the gene, then the child will develop the disease), there is 50 % chance that the child will develop achondroplasia if one parent has achondroplasia. The risk of the child developing the diseases rises to 75% if both parents have achondroplasia."
4660,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Achondroplasia ?,"If there is a family history of achondroplasia and you plan to have children, you may find it helpful to speak to your health care provider."
4661,What to expect if I have Achondroplasia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"People with achondroplasia seldom reach 5 feet in height. Intelligence is in the normal range.
Dwarfism itself is not a disease. However, there is a greater risk of some health problems for people affected by Dwarfism. With proper medical care, most people with dwarfism have active lives and live as long as other people.
Infants who receives the abnormal gene from both parents do not often live beyond a few months."
4662,What are the symptoms of Ataxia?,"Symptoms may include:
Inability to stand without swaying A uneven gait that may look like the person is drunk Involuntary shifting of the eyes (nystagmus) Unusual speech patterns such as: Monotonous tone Either rushing words or placing large gaps between syllables Impaired motions Tremors in the limbs, particularly towards the end of movements
A patient with ataxia may also experience other neurological symptoms such as dementia, seizures, or a wide array of other disorders."
4663,What causes Ataxia?,"When there is a problem in the communication between parts of the brain that control movement, ataxia results. Some forms of ataxia are inherited. Such forms include:
Friedreich ataxia Type 1 and Type 2 Episodic ataxia Fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome Types 1-28 of Spinocerebellar ataxia
Other inherited causes of ataxia include:
Metabolic disorders Dentatorubro-palidoluysian atrophy Wilson's disease Vitamin E dificiency
Other causes of ataxia that are not inherited include:
Multiple sclerosis Malabsorption of Vitamin E Brain tumor Brain lesion Toxins Infection such as HIV, syphilis, or prion disease Paraneoplastic syndrome Cerebellar form of multiple system atrophy"
4664,Who is at highest risk for Ataxia ?,Those who have a family history of inherited ataxia may be at higher risk for developing ataxia. Genetic testing may be recommended in these cases.
4665,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ataxia ?,"Many neurological disorders have ataxia as a symptom. Therefore, if you think you might be experiencing ataxia, you should make an appointment with your medical care professional."
4666,What to expect if I have Ataxia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Outlook varies widely depending on the cause of the ataxia and whether or not a serious condition is the underlying cause of the ataxia.
4667,What are the symptoms of Down syndrome?,"Down syndrome symptoms vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. However, children with Down syndrome have a widely recognized appearance. The head may be smaller than normal and abnormally shaped. For example, the head may be round with a flat area on the back. The inner corner of the eyes may be rounded instead of pointed. Common physical signs include:
Decreased muscle tone at birth Excess skin at the nape of the neck Flattened nose Separated joints between the bones of the skull (sutures) Single crease in the palm of the hand Small ears Small mouth Upward slanting eyes Wide, short hands with short fingers White spots on the colored part of the eye (Brushfield spots)
Physical development is often slower than normal. Most children with Down syndrome never reach their average adult height.
Children may also have delayed mental and social development. Common problems may include:
Impulsive behavior Poor judgment Short attention span Slow learning
As children with Down syndrome grow and become aware of their limitations, they may also feel frustration and anger.
Many different medical conditions are seen in people with Down syndrome, including:
Birth defects involving the heart, such as an atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect Dementia may be seen Eye problems, such as cataracts (most children with Down syndrome need glasses) Early and massive vomiting, which may be a sign of a gastrointestinal blockage, such as esophageal atresia and duodenal atresia Hearing problems, probably caused by regular ear infections Hip problems and risk of dislocation Long-term (chronic) constipation problems Sleep apnea (because the mouth, throat, and airway are narrowed in children with Down syndrome) Teeth that appear later than normal and in a location that may cause problems with chewing Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)"
4668,Who is at highest risk for Down syndrome ?,"Experts recommend genetic counseling for persons with a family history of Down syndrome who wish to have a baby. A woman's risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases as she gets older. The risk is significantly higher among women age 35 and older. Couples who already have a baby with Down syndrome have an increased risk of having another baby with the condition. Tests such as nuchal translucency ultrasound, amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling can be done on a fetus during the first few months of pregnancy to check for Down syndrome. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering Down syndrome screening tests to all pregnant women, regardless of age."
4669,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Down syndrome ?,A health care provider should be consulted to determine if the child needs special education and training. It is important for the child to have regular check ups with his or her doctor.
4670,What are the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome?,"The physical features of Fragile X syndrome is prominent around the time of puberty. Physical features include:
Large and protruding ears Elongated face Macroorchidism (large testicles in men after puberty) Flat foot High Arched palate Hyperflexible finger joints Low muscle tone
The common features in child with Fragile X Syndrome include low IQ with learning difficulties (intellectual disabilities). Behavioral abnormalities includes stereotypic movements (e.g., hand- flapping) hyperactivity, i nattention, poor social interaction, limited eye contact and poor memory. Child with Fragile X syndrome often presents with developmental delay (including delayed attainment of motor and language milestones). Approximately, 20% of boy with Fragile X syndrome develops seizures (mostly simple or complex partial seizures)"
4671,What are the causes of Fragile X syndrome?,"Fragile x Syndrome is a genetic disease which is caused by mutation in the Fragile x Mental Retardation 1(FMR1) gene in X chromosome. Generally, these mutation (>200 repeats of CGG) occurs at in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1. In around 2% of cases, Fragile X syndrome can occur as a result of point mutation in FMR1 gene.
Normally, the FMR1 gene makes a protein you need for your brain to grow properly. A defect in this gene makes your body produce too little of the protein, or none at all.
Boys and girls can both be affected, but because boys have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X is likely to affect them more severely. You can have Fragile X syndrome even if your parents do not have it."
4672,Who is at highest risk for Fragile X syndrome ?,"There are no established risk factors for Fragile X syndrome. However, the child with family history of Fragile x Syndrome, autism disorder of unknown cause, developmental delay, adult onset ataxia/tremor or any intellectual disabilities are at greater risk of developing the disorder."
4673,How to know you have Fragile X syndrome?,"The diagnosis of Fragile X Syndrome is based upon detection of an alteration in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Clinically, mentally retarded child with family history of Fragile X syndrome (especially a male relative) have higher chance of inheriting the disease. There are very few outward signs of Fragile X syndrome in babies. Babies may have a large head circumference. Measurement of oversized testes in males who have reached puberty may also suggest the diagnosis. An experienced geneticist may note subtle differences in facial characteristics. Mental retardation is the hallmark of this condition and, in females, this may be the only sign of the disease. A specific genetic test called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to diagnose this disease. This test looks for an expanded mutation (called a triplet repea t) in the FMR1 gene."
4674,What are the possible complications?,Complications in Fragile X syndrome patient may include scoliosis or mitral valve prolapse (most frequently encountered cardiac defect).
4675,What are the symptoms of Gaucher's disease?,"Symptoms vary depending on the type of disease, but may include:
Bone pain and fractures Cognitive impairment Easy bruising Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) Fatigue Heart valve problems Lung disease Seizures Severe swelling (edema) at birth Skin changes"
4676,What causes Gaucher's disease?,"The lack of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme causes harmful substances to build up in the liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow. The substances prevent cells and organs from working properly.
There are three main subtypes of Gaucher disease:
Type 1 disease is most common. It involves bone disease, anemia, an enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. Type I affects both children and adults. It is most common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Type 2 disease usually begins in infancy with severe neurologic involvement. This form can lead to rapid, early death. Type 3 disease may cause liver, spleen, and brain problems. Patients may live into adulthood."
4677,Who is at highest risk for Gaucher%27s disease ?,"Gaucher disease affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 people in the general population. Persons of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage are at highest risk for the disease.
It is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that the mother and father must both pass one abnormal copy of the gene to the child in order for the child to develop the disease. A parent who silently carries an abnormal copy of the gene is called a carrier."
4678,What to expect if I have Gaucher%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well a person does depends on the subtype of the disease. The infantile form of Gaucher disease may lead to early death. Most affected children die before age 5.
Adults with the type 1 form of the disease can expect normal life expectancy with enzyme replacement therapy."
4679,Who provides it?,"Genetic counseling is usually provided by genetic counselors. Genetic counselors are present at high risk or specialty prenatal clinics that offer prenatal diagnosis, pediatric care centers, and adult genetic centers.
A genetic counselor is a medical genetics expert with a master of science degree. In the USA they are certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling . Most enter the field from a variety of disciplines, including biology, genetics, nursing, psychology, public health and social work.
Genetic counselors work as members of a health care team and act as a patient advocate as well as a genetic resource to physicians. Genetic counselors provide information and support to families who have members with birth defects or genetic disorders, and to families who may be at risk for a variety of inherited conditions. They identify families at risk, investigate the problems present in the family, interpret information about the disorder, analyze inheritance patterns and risks of recurrence and review available testing options with the family."
4680,What are the symptoms of Macrocephaly?,"Increased pressure in the head (increased intracranial pressure) often occurs with increased head circumference. Symptoms of this condition include:
Eyes moving downward Irritability Vomiting"
4681,What causes Macrocephaly?,"Benign familial macrocephaly (family tendency toward large head size)
Canavan disease Hurler syndrome Hydrocephalus (congenital, post-traumatic, or obstructive) Intracranial bleeding Morquio syndrome"
4682,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Macrocephaly ?,"The health care provider usually finds macrocephaly during a routine well-baby exam.
The health care provider will take a medical history and will perform a physical examination.
Medical history questions may include: Time pattern When did you first notice that the baby's head seemed large? Does the baby's head size seem to be increasing faster compared to the growth of the body? Location Does the head seem larger all over? Is the head growing more in a front-to-back pattern or in a side-to-side pattern? Other What other symptoms are present (especially changes in brain or nervous system functions)?
The distance is measured in centimeters or inches and compared with: Past measurments of a child's head circumference Normal ranges for a child's sex and age (weeks, months) -- based on normal growth rates of infants' and children's heads
A careful physical exam will be done. Other milestones for growth and development will be checked.
In some cases, a single measurement is enough to confirm that there is a size increase that needs to be tested further. More often, repeated measurements of the head circumference over a period of time are needed to confirm that the head circumference is increased and the problem is getting worse.
Diagnostic tests vary depending on the cause, but often include: Head CT scan MRI of the head"
4683,What are the symptoms of Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses?,Abnormally increased muscle tone or spasm (myoclonus) Blindness or vision problems Dementia Lack of muscle coordination Mental retardation with decreasing mental function Movement disorder (choreoathetosis) Seizures Unsteady gait (ataxia)
4684,What causes Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses?,NCLS is a type of neurodegenerative disorder. It involves the buildup of an abnormal material called lipofuscin in the brain. Evidence suggests that NCLS is caused by problems with the brain's ability to remove and recycle proteins.
4685,Who is at highest risk for Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ?,"Lipofuscinoses are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. That means if both parents carry the trait, each child has:
A 1 in 4 chance of having the disease A 2 in 4 chance of not having the disease but carrying the trait A 1 in 4 chance of not having the disease and not being a carrier"
4686,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ?,Call your health care provider if your child shows symptoms of blindness or retardation.
4687,What to expect if I have Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The younger the person is when the disease appears, the greater the risk for disability and early death. Those who develop the disease early can have vision problems that progress to blindness, and problems with mental function that get worse. If the disease emerges in the first year of life, death by age 10 is likely.
If the disease occurs in adulthood, symptoms will be milder with no vision loss and a normal life expectancy."
4688,What are the symptoms of Phenylketonuria?,"Phenylalanine plays a role in the body's production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair color. Therefore, infants with the condition often have lighter skin, hair, and eyes than brothers or sisters without the disease.
Other symptoms may include:
Delayed mental and social skills Head size significantly below normal Hyperactivity Jerking movements of the arms or legs Mental retardation Seizures Skin rashes Tremors Unusual positioning of hands
If the condition is untreated or foods containing phenylalanine are not avoided, a ""mousy"" or ""musty"" odor may be detected on the breath and skin and in urine. The unusual odor is due to a build up of phenylalanine substances in the body."
4689,What causes Phenylketonuria?,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. Both parents must pass on the defective gene in order for a baby to have the condition. This is called an autosomal recessive trait.
Babies with PKU are missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is needed to break down an essential amino acid called phenylalanine. The substance is found in foods that contain protein.
Without the enzyme, levels of phenylalanine and two closely-related substances build up in the body. These substances are harmful to the central nervous system and cause brain damage."
4690,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Phenylketonuria ?,Call your health care provider if your infant has not been tested for PKU. This is particularly important if anyone in your family has the disorder.
4691,What to expect if I have Phenylketonuria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is expected to be very good if the diet is closely followed, starting shortly after the child's birth. If treatment is delayed or the condition remains untreated, brain damage will occur. School functioning may be mildly impaired.
If proteins containing phenylalanine are not avoided, PKU can lead to mental retardation by the end of the first year of life."
4692,What are the symptoms of Polycystic kidney disease?,"Abdominal pain or tenderness Blood in the urine Excessive urination at night Flank pain on one or both sides
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease include the following:
Drowsiness High blood pressure Joint pain Nail abnormalities Painful menstruation"
4693,What causes Polycystic kidney disease?,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is passed down through families (inherited), usually as an autosomal dominant trait. If one parent carries the gene, the children have a 50% chance of developing the disorder.
Autosomal dominant PKD occurs in both children and adults, but it is much more common in adults, with symptoms often not showing up until middle age. It affects nearly 1 in 1,000 Americans. The actual number may be more, as some people do not have symptoms. The disorder may not be discovered unless tests revealing the disease are performed for other reasons.
An autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease also exists and appears in infancy or childhood. This type tends to be very serious and progresses rapidly, resulting in end-stage kidney failure and generally causing death in infancy or childhood.
Persons with PKD have multiple clusters of cysts form on the kidneys. The exact action that triggers cyst formation is unknown. In early stages of the disease, the cysts cause the kidney to swell, disrupting kidney function and leading to chronic high blood pressure and kidney infections. The cysts may cause the kidneys to increase production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. This leads to too many red blood cells, rather than the anemia seen in chronic kidney disease.
Bleeding in a cyst can cause flank pain. Kidney stones are more common in people with PKD.
PKD is associated with the following conditions:
Brain aneurysms Cysts in the liver, pancreas, and testes Diverticula of the colon
As many as half of people with PKD have cysts on the liver."
4694,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Polycystic kidney disease ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms indicate polycystic kidney disease may be present.
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if there is a family history of polycystic kidney disease or associated disorders and children are planned. Genetic counseling may be offered."
4695,Who is at highest risk for Polycystic kidney disease ?,"A personal or family history of PKD increases your risk for the condition. In a family with several members with PKD, genetic tests can be done to determine whether a person at risk carries the PKD gene."
4696,What to expect if I have Polycystic kidney disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The disease gets worse slowly, eventually resulting in end-stage kidney failure. It is also associated with liver disease, including infection of liver cysts.
Medical treatment may provide relief of symptoms for many years.
The absence of systemic disease or autoimmune disease makes people with polycystic kidney disease good candidates for kidney transplantation."
4697,What are the symptoms of progeria?,"Children with progeria usually look normal at birth and in early infancy. However, within a year, affected children grow slowly and become much shorter and weigh much less than peers. They appear a characteristic facial appearance, including the following:
Prominent eyes, a thin nose with a beaked tip, thin lips, a small chin, and protruding ears. Bald, aged-looking skin, a loss of fat under the skin Hair loss Joint abnormalities
Also, they suffer from symptoms typically seen in much older people, such as coronary artery disease, cataracts, osteoarthritis and stroke. Death occurs on average at age 13, usually from heart attack or stroke."
4698,Who is at highest risk for Progeria ?,"Progeria is a very rare disease in the world. The cause is not clear. Researchers found that mutations in the LMNA gene may be associated with progeria. The LMNA gene provides instructions for making lamin A protein, which is the structural scaffolding that holds the nucleus of a cell together. Researches demonstrate that the defective Lamin A protein makes the nucleus unstable."
4699,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Progeria ?,"Some children with progeria suffer from symptoms of coronary artery disease and stroke, which often appear in old people. These diseases may be severe and fatal. If your child experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Chest pain Shortness of breath Palpitation Diaphoresis Headache Hemiplegia and muscle weakness of the face Numbness Reduction in sensory or vibratory sensation Loss of consciousness"
4700,What to expect if I have Progeria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis of children with progeria is very poor. They may suffer from diseases such as coronary artery disease, cataracts, osteoarthritis and stroke. Death occurs on average at age 13, usually from heart attack or stroke."
4701,What are the symptoms of Spinal muscular atrophy?,"Infants with SMA type I (the most severe form of SMA) are born with very decreased muscle tone, weak muscles, and feeding and breathing problems. With SMA type III (the mildest form), symptoms may not appear until the second year of life.
Often, weakness is first noted in the shoulder muscles and proximal leg muscles. Weakness gets worse over time and will eventually become severe.
Symptoms in an infant:
Breathing difficulty Feeding difficulty Floppy infant (poor muscle tone) Lack of head control Little spontaneous movement Progressive weakness (older infant to toddler) Very weak infant
Symptoms in a child:
Frequent, increasingly severe respiratory infections Nasal speech Worsening posture"
4702,What causes Spinal muscular atrophy?,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a collection of different muscle diseases. Grouped together, it is the second leading cause of neuromuscular disease. Most of the time, a person must get the defective gene from both parents to be affected. Approximately, 4 out of every 100,000 people have the condition.
The most severe form is SMA type I, also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Infants with SMA type II have less severe symptoms during early infancy, but they become progressively weaker with time. SMA type III is the least severe form of the disease.
Rarely, SMA may begin in adulthood. This is usually a milder form of the disease.
A family history of spinal muscular atrophy is a risk factor for all types of the disorder."
4703,Possible Complications?,Aspiration Contractions of muscles and tendons Respiratory infections Scoliosis
4704,When to Contact a Medical Professional?,"Call your health care provider if your child:
Appears weak Develops any other symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy Has difficulty feeding
Breathing difficulty can rapidly become an emergency condition."
4705,What are the symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease?,"The most common form of Tay-Sachs disease becomes apparent in infancy. Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when their development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling. They also develop an exaggerated startle reaction to loud noises. As the disease progresses, children with Tay-Sachs disease experience seizures, vision and hearing loss, intellectual disability, and paralysis. An eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. Children with this severe infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease usually live only into early childhood.
Other forms of Tay-Sachs disease are very rare. Signs and symptoms can appear in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood and are usually milder than those seen with the infantile form. Characteristic features include muscle weakness, loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) and other problems with movement, speech problems, and mental illness. These signs and symptoms vary widely among people with late-onset forms of Tay-Sachs disease."
4706,Who is at risk for Tay-Sachs disease?,"Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive condition, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
Tay-Sachs disease is very rare in the general population. The genetic mutations that cause this disease are more common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage than in those with other backgrounds. The mutations responsible for this disease are also more common in certain French-Canadian communities of Quebec, the Old Order Amish community in Pennsylvania, and the Cajun population of Louisiana."
4707,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tay-Sachs disease ?,See your doctor immediately if your child displays any of the symptoms listed above
4708,What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?,"Dementia symptoms involve difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:
Language Memory Perception Emotional behavior or personality Cognitive skills (such as calculation, abstract thinking, or judgment)
Dementia usually first manifests as forgetfulness.
Mild cognitive impairment is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of AD. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with everyday activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops AD.
Symptoms of mild cognitive impairment include:
Forgetting recent events or conversations Difficulty performing more than one task at a time Difficulty solving problems Taking longer than normal to perform more difficult activities
The early symptoms of AD can include:
Language problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects Misplacing items Getting lost on familiar routes Personality changes and loss of social skills Losing interest in things previously enjoyed; flat mood Difficulty performing tasks that require some thought, but which used to come easily (e.g., balancing a checkbook, playing complex games such as bridge, and learning new information or routines)
As the AD becomes worse, symptoms become more obvious and interfere with the patient's ability to take care of himself/herself. Symptoms can include:
Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you are Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Difficulty reading or writing Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and exhibiting violent behavior Having delusions; experiencing depression and/or agitation Difficulty carrying out basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving
People with severe AD can no longer:
Understand language Recognize family members Perform the basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing
Other symptoms that may occur with AD:
Incontinence Swallowing problems"
4709,What causes Alzheimer's disease?,"Scientists do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer’s disease, but it is clear that it develops because of a complex series of events that take place in the brain over a long period of time. It is likely that the causes include genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Because people differ in their genetic make-up and lifestyle, the importance of these factors in preventing or delaying Alzheimer’s differs from person to person. In a very small number of families, people develop Alzheimer’s disease in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Many of these people have a mutation, or permanent change, in one of three genes that they inherited from a parent. We know that these gene mutations cause Alzheimer’s in these “early-onset” familial cases. Not all early-onset cases are caused by such mutations. Most people with Alzheimer’s disease have “late-onset” Alzheimer’s, which usually develops after age 60. Many studies have linked a gene called APOE to late-onset Alzheimer’s. This gene has several forms. One of them, APOE ε4, increases a person’s risk of getting the disease. About 40 percent of all people who develop late-onset Alzheimer’s carry this gene. However, carrying the APOE ε4 form of the gene does not necessarily mean that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease, and people carrying no APOE ε4 forms can also develop the disease. Most experts believe that additional genes may influence the development of late-onset Alzheimer’s in some way. Scientists around the world are searching for these genes. Researchers have identified variants of the SORL1, CLU, PICALM, and CR1 genes that may play a role in risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s.
A nutritious diet, physical activity, social engagement, and mentally stimulating pursuits can all help people stay healthy. New research suggests the possibility that these factors also might help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists are investigating associations between cognitive decline and vascular and metabolic conditions such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Understanding these relationships and testing them in clinical trials will help us understand whether reducing risk factors for these diseases may help with Alzheimer’s as well."
4710,Who is at highest risk for Alzheimer%27s disease ?,"Age and family history are the best-understood risk factors for AD.
As you get older, your risk of developing AD increases. Nonetheless, developing Alzheimer's disease is not a normal aspect of the aging process. Having a close blood relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent who developed AD increases your risk for developing AD. Having certain combination of genes for proteins that appear to be abnormal in Alzheimer's disease also increases your risk.
Other risk factors that are not as well understood include:
Longstanding high blood pressure History of head trauma Female gender"
4711,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alzheimer%27s disease ?,"Call your health care provider if someone close to you experiences symptoms of senile dementia / Alzheimer's disease.
Call your health care provider if a person with this disorder experiences a sudden change in mental status. (A rapid change may indicate the presence of another illness.)
Discuss the situation with your health care provider if you are caring for a person with this disorder and the condition deteriorates to the point where you can no longer care for the person in your home."
4712,What to expect if I have Alzheimer%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The trajectory of AD is different for each person. If AD develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly. Patients with AD often die earlier than normal, although a patient may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after being diagnosed. The final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the patient becomes immobile and totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or a failure of other body systems."
4713,Centenarians—What Makes Them the Anti-Aging All Stars?,"One way to find what helps people live long healthy lives is to study those who have succeeded. Centenarians have written best selling books, excelled in sports, piloted airplanes, practiced medicine, danced, sculpted, taught in universities, graduated from universities, run for Congress, and even fathered children.
The current documented record holder for longevity was Jeanne Calment, a French woman who lived 122 years and died in 1997. There are reports of older people in some remote villages but there is no documentation to verify the claims (and they live in cultures that give great status to the oldest). Centenarians have become so common, the newest category is “Super Centenarians,” those 110+ years old.
The most definitive research on centenarians is Thomas Perls, MD and Margery’s Living to 100 study of New England centenarians. Interviews with centenarians include Lynn Adler ’s Centenarians: The Bonus Years and photographer Liane Enkelis ’ incredible photographs and stories in On Being 100. There are quite a few autobiographies and biographies including Jeanne Calment: From Van Gough’s Time to Ours.
Research suggests that centenarians have little in common physically. They are physically active people, most don’t smoke, and they typically maintained about the same body weight through their adult life.
The role of genetics in longevity is complex. A genetic vulnerability to a life threatening disease, e.g., malaria, reduces life expectancy. If a vaccine or cure is developed, the same genes no longer present a problem. With Alzheimer’s disease, for example, those with the certain apo-E gene patterns have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s. When scientists develop a cure, Alzheimer’s will no longer compromise the quality and length of life for those who are at risk.
There appear to be genes that foster living longer. Researchers have extended the life of fruit flies by 30% by giving them an extra copy of a gene. Other researchers extended the life of nematodes (microscopic worms) by 500% by removing a gene. It isn’t clear yet why the genetic engineering is extending the lives, but the results are promising.
Danish researchers compared identical and fraternal twins and extrapolated that only 30% of longevity is genetic. That means that 70% is lifestyle and the choices people make. George Valliant, Ph.D., and subsequent researchers have followed Harvard freshman in the classes from 1939-1949 periodically to the present. One especially notable finding was that men who had traits such as optimism and humor as freshmen were less likely to develop chronic illness or die by age 45. The difference was even more pronounced at age 60."
4714,What are the symptoms of Hearing impairment?,"Symptoms of hearing loss may include:
Certain sounds seem too loud Difficulty following conversations when two or more people are talking Difficulty hearing in noisy areas Hard to tell high-pitched sounds (such as ""s"" or ""th"") from one another Less trouble hearing men's voices than women's voices Problems hearing when there is background noise Voices that sound mumbled or slurred
Other symptoms include:
Feeling of being off-balance or dizzy (more common with Meniere's disease and acoustic neuroma) Pressure in the ear (in fluid behind the eardrum) Ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus)"
4715,What are the causes of Hearing impairment?,"Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear. The three tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) may not conduct sound properly or the eardrum may not vibrate in response to sound.
Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. They include:
Buildup of wax in the ear canal Damage to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum Fluid that stays in the ear after an ear infection Foreign object that is stuck in the ear canal Hole in the eardrum Scar on the eardrum from repeat infections
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed.
Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by:
Acoustic neuroma Age-related hearing loss Childhood infections, such as meningitis, mumps, scarlet fever, and measles Meniere's disease Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation) Use of certain medicines
Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to:
Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures Genetic conditions (more than 400 are known) Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, or herpes)
The ear can also be injured by:
Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum, often from scuba diving Skull fractures (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear) Trauma from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones"
4716,What are the symptoms of Neuralgia?,"Increased sensitivity of the skin along the path of the damaged nerve, so that any touch or pressure is felt as pain Numbness along the path of the nerve In the same location each episode Sharp, stabbing May come and go (intermittent), or be constant, burning pain May get worse when the area is moved Weakness or complete paralysis of muscles supplied by the same nerve"
4717,What causes Neuralgia?,"Causes of neuralgia include:
Chemical irritation Chronic renal insufficiency Diabetes Infections, such as herpes zoster (shingles), HIV, Lyme disease, and syphilis Medications such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, or vincristine Porphyria Pressure on nerves by nearby bones, ligaments, blood vessels, or tumors Trauma (including surgery)
In many cases, the cause is unknown.
Postherpetic neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia are the two most common forms of neuralgia. A related but less common neuralgia affects the glossopharyngeal nerve, which provides feeling to the throat."
4718,Who is at highest risk for Neuralgia ?,"Neuralgia is more common in elderly people, but it may occur at any age."
4719,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Neuralgia ?,"Contact your health care provider if:
You develop shingles You have symptoms of neuralgia, especially if over-the-counter pain medications do not relieve your pain You have severe pain (see a pain specialist)"
4720,What to expect if I have Neuralgia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most neuralgias are not life-threatening and are not signs of other life-threatening disorders. However, pain can be severe. For severe pain that does not improve, see a pain specialist so that you can explore all treatment options.
Most neuralgias will respond to treatment. Attacks of pain usually come and go. However, attacks may become more frequent in some patients as they get older."
4721,What causes Nocturia?,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia Certain drugs including diuretics, demeclocycline, lithium, methoxyflurane, phenytoin, and propoxyphene Chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection Chronic renal failure Congestive heart failure Cystitis Diabetes Drinking too much fluid before bedtime, particularly coffee, caffeinated beverages, or alcohol High blood calcium level Obstructive sleep apnea and other sleeping disorders"
4722,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nocturia ?,"Make an appointment with your health care provider if:
Excessive nighttime urination continues over several days, and is not explained by medications or increase of fluids before bedtime You are bothered by the number of times you must urinate during the night"
4723,What are the symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"Symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary with each individual and the stage of Parkinson's disease. In the early course, Parkinson's disease does not have any symptoms. As the disease developes, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Tremor: Tremor is one of the most common signs of Parkinson's disease. It often affects in a hand, arm, or leg. It occurs when the person is awake and sitting or standing still, and subsides when the person moves the affected body part. Rigidity: Muscle stiffness often occurs in the limbs and neck. Later, the patient can not move an arm or leg normally and feel pain in the limb. Masked face: This appearance is cause by loss of movement in the muscles in the face. Patients with Parkinson's disease may feel it difficult to speak and swallow. Slowness of movement (bradykinesia) and impaired balance: In the later course of the disease, patients with Parkinson's disease are likely to take small steps and shuffle with the feet close together. They also have trouble in turning around and keeping balance. These abnormities may result in frequent falls. Freezing Constipation Dementia: Patients may appear progressively memory loss, losing interest in things they previously enjoyed, difficulty communicating, reading or writing, difficulty with performing tasks. With time goes on, more signs such as withdrawing from social contact, personality changes and inappropriate behavior may be observed."
4724,Who is at highest risk for Parkinson%27s disease ?,"The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown. Many researchers believe that a combination of several factors is involved in the development of this disease.
Free radicals Aging Environmental toxins Genetic predisposition"
4725,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Parkinson%27s disease ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of Parkinson's disaese develop.
4726,What to expect if I have Parkinson%27s disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of Parkinson's disease varies from person to person. It depends on:
Whether the patient can be treated early Whether the patient can get a good care or not Whether the patient is accompanied with complications, such as pneumonia, dementia, falling injury or fracture."
4727,What are the symptoms of Adenomyosis?,"Long-term or heavy menstrual bleeding Painful menstruation, which gets increasing worse Pelvic pain during intercourse
Note: In many cases, the woman may not have any symptoms."
4728,What causes Adenomyosis?,"The cause is unknown. Sometimes adenomyosis may cause a mass or growth within the uterus, which is called an adenomyoma."
4729,Who is at highest risk for Adenomyosis ?,The disease usually occurs in women older than 30 who have had children. It is more likely in women with previous cesarean section or other uterine surgery.
4730,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Adenomyosis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of adenomyosis.
4731,What to expect if I have Adenomyosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Symptoms usually go away after menopause. A hysterectomy completely relieves symptoms.
4732,What are the symptoms of Bartholin's abscess?,A tender lump on either side of the vaginal opening Fever Pain with sexual intercourse
4733,What causes Bartholin's abscess?,"A Bartholin's abscess forms when a small opening (duct) from the gland gets blocked. Fluid in the gland builds up and may become infected. Fluid may build up over many years before an abscess occurs.
Often the abscess appears quickly over several days and become very hot and swollen. Activity that puts pressure on the vulva, and walking and sitting, may cause excruciating pain."
4734,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bartholin%27s abscess ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if a painful, swollen lump is noted on the labia near the vaginal opening and does not improve with 2 - 3 days of home treatment. Call if pain is severe and interferes with normal activity.
Call your health care provider if you have one of these cysts and develop a fever higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit."
4735,What to expect if I have Bartholin%27s abscess  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The chance of full recovery is excellent. About 10% of the time, abscesses recur.
It is important to treat any vaginal infection that may be diagnosed at the same time as the abscess."
4736,How is the Colposcopic biopsy done?,"You will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups to position your pelvis for examination. The health care provider will insert an instrument (speculum) into your vagina to open the vaginal walls and examine the cervix.
The cervix and vagina are gently swabbed with dilute vinegar (acetic acid). This removes the mucus that covers the surface and highlights abnormal areas. Sometime an iodine-based solution (Lugol's) similar to solutions used for cleaning skin may also be swabbed on the cervix and vagina.
The health care provider will place the colposcope at the opening of the vagina and examine the area. Photographs may be taken. The colposcope does not touch you.
If any areas look abnormal, a small sample of the tissue will be removed (biopsy) using small biopsy forceps. Many samples may be taken, depending on the size and location of the area. Sometimes a tissue sample from inside the cervix is removed. This is called endocervical curettage (ECC)."
4737,Who needs Colposcopic biopsy?,"Colposcopy is done to detect either cancer of the cervix or changes that may lead to cancer at an early stage.
This procedure is most often done when you have had an abnormal Pap smear. It may also be recommended if you have bleeding after sexual intercourse.
Colposcopy may also be done when your health care provider sees abnormal areas on your cervix during a pelvic exam. These may include:
Any abnormal growth on the cervix, or elsewhere in the vagina Genital warts or HPV Irritation or inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis)
The colposcopy may be used to keep track of HPV, and to look for abnormal changes that can come back after treatment."
4738,How to prepare for Colposcopic biopsy?,"There is no special preparation. You may be more comfortable if you empty your bladder and bowel before the procedure.
You should not douche, place any products into the vagina, or have sexual intercourse for 24 hours before the exam. You should not be menstruating heavily. However, if you are at the very end or beginning of your regular period or you are having abnormal bleeding, you should still keep your appointment.
You may be able to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) before the colposcopy. Ask your doctor if this is okay, and when and how much you should take.
Tell your doctor before the test if you are pregnant or could be pregnant."
4739,What do I experience during the procedure?,"The placement of the instrument (speculum) to better see the cervix may be more uncomfortable than for a regular Pap smear.
Some women feel a slight sting from the vinegar or Lugol's solution.
The biopsy or curettage may feel like a pinch or cramp each time a tissue sample is taken. You may have some cramping or slight bleeding after the biopsy. Heavy bleeding is unusual; if you have bleeding that soaks a pad in an hour, call your doctor. Do not use tampons or put anything in the vagina for several days after a biopsy.
It is typical for women to hold their breath during pelvic procedures because they expect pain. Concentrating on slow, regular breathing will help you relax and relieve pain. Ask your doctor or nurse about bringing a support person with you if that will help."
4740,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Colposcopic biopsy ?,"After biopsy, call your health care provider if:
Bleeding is very heavy or lasts for longer than 2 weeks. You have pain in your belly or in the pelvic area. You notice any signs of infection (fever, foul odor, or discharge)."
4741,Where to find centers that perform Colposcopic biopsy?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Colposcopic biopsy
4742,What to expect if I have Colposcopic biopsy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After the biopsy, you may have some bleeding for up to a week. You may have mild cramping, your vagina may feel sore, and you may have a dark discharge for 1 - 3 days.
A colposcopy and biopsy will not make it more difficult for you to become pregnant, or cause problems during pregnancy.
You may have some bleeding after the biopsy for up to 1 week.
You should not douche, place tampons or creams into the vagina, or have sex for up to a week afterward. Ask your doctor or nurse how long you should wait. You can use sanitary pads.
If the colposcopy or biopsy does not show why the Pap smear was abnormal, your health care provider may suggest that you have a more extensive biopsy."
4743,What are the symptoms of Cystocele?,"A bladder that has dropped from its normal position may cause two kinds of problems-unwanted urine leakage and incomplete emptying of the bladder. In some women, a fallen bladder stretches the opening into the urethra, causing urine leakage when the woman coughs, sneezes, laughs, or moves in any way that puts pressure on the bladder."
4744,What causes Cystocele?,"A cystocele may result from muscle straining while giving birth. Other kinds of straining-such as heavy lifting or repeated straining during bowel movements-may also cause the bladder to fall. The hormone estrogen helps keep the muscles around the vagina strong. When women go through menopause-that is, when they stop having menstrual periods-their bodies stop making estrogen, so the muscles around the vagina and bladder may grow weak.
A cystocele is mild-grade 1-when the bladder droops only a short way into the vagina. With a more severe-grade 2-cystocele, the bladder sinks far enough to reach the opening of the vagina. The most advanced-grade 3-cystocele occurs when the bladder bulges out through the opening of the vagina."
4745,Who is at highest risk for Cystocele ?,"Following factors increases the risk for developing cyslocele:
Vaginal delivery of a child Risk increases with age and is seen more frequently in postmenopausal women. Hysterectomy - surgical removal of uterus Connective tissue disorders which occur in genetically predisposed women."
4746,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cystocele ?,Consult your health care provider if you experience the above mentioned symptoms.
4747,How is the Dilation and curettage done?,"D and C, also called uterine scraping, may be performed in the hospital or in a clinic while you are under general or local anesthesia.
The health care provider will insert an instrument called a speculum into the vagina. This holds open the vaginal canal. Numbing medicine may be applied to the opening to the uterus (cervix).
The cervical canal is widened using a metal rod, and a curette (a metal loop on the end of a long, thin handle) is passed through the opening into the uterus cavity. The doctor gently scrapes the inner layer of tissue, called the endometrium. The tissue is collected for examination."
4748,Who needs Dilation and curettage?,"This procedure may be done to:
Diagnose conditions such as uterine cancer Remove tissue after a miscarriage Treat heavy menstrual bleeding or irregular periods Perform a therapeutic or elective abortion
Your doctor may also recommend a D and C if you have:
Abnormal bleeding while on hormone replacement therapy An embedded intrauterine device (IUD) Bleeding after menopause Endometrial polyps Thickening of the uterus
This list may not be all-inclusive."
4749,Where to find centers that perform Dilation and curettage?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Dilation and curettage
4750,What to expect if I have Dilation and curettage  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"You may return to normal activities as soon as you feel better, possibly even the same day. There may be vaginal bleeding, as well as pelvic cramps and back pain for a few days after the procedure.
You can usually manage pain well with medications. Tampon use and sexual intercourse are not recommended for 1 - 2 weeks after this procedure."
4751,What causes Dyspareunia?,"A diaphragm that does not fit properly Endometriosis Genital irritation from soaps, detergents, douches, or feminine hygiene products Hemorrhoids Herpes sores, genital warts, or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Intercourse too soon after surgery or childbirth Menopause Ovarian cysts Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) Reaction to the latex of a diaphragm or condom Sexual abuse or rape Urinary tract infections Use of certain medications Vaginal dryness Vaginal infection Vaginismus"
4752,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dyspareunia ?,"Call your doctor if:
Home remedies are not working. You have other symptoms with painful intercourse, like bleeding, genital lesions, irregular periods, discharge from penis or vagina, or involuntary vaginal muscle contraction.
If you have been sexually assaulted, report the crime to the police and go to the emergency room immediately. Get a trusted friend to accompany you. Do NOT change, bathe, shower or even wash your hands before the ER evaluation. The temptation to do so will be great, but it is important to not lose any evidence in order to help find, charge, and convict the suspect."
4753,How is the Endometrial biopsy done?,"This procedure may be done with or without anesthesia. You will lie on your back with your feet in stirrups.
The health care provider will do a pelvic examination, and will insert an instrument (speculum) into the vagina to hold it open and see the cervix.
The cervix is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid and then grasped with an instrument (tenaculum) to hold the uterus steady. A device called a cervical dilator may be needed to stretch the cervical canal if there is tightness (stenosis). Then a small, hollow plastic tube is gently passed into the uterine cavity.
Gentle suction removes a sample of the lining. The tissue sample and instruments are removed. A specialist called a pathologist examines the sample under a microscope."
4754,Who needs Endometrial biopsy?,"The test is done to find the cause of:
Abnormal menstrual periods (heavy, prolonged, or irregular bleeding) Bleeding after menopause Bleeding from taking hormone therapy medications Thickened uterine lining seen on ultrasound The test is usually done in women over age 35.
This test can also be used to test for endometrial cancer. Sometimes, it is used as part of the diagnosis in women who have been unable to become pregnant (see infertility)."
4755,How to prepare for Endometrial biopsy?,"There is no special preparation for the biopsy. You may want to take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) 1 hour before the procedure to reduce cramping."
4756,What do I experience during the procedure?,The instruments may feel cold. You may feel some pain when the cervix is grasped. You may have some cramping as the instruments enter the uterus and the sample is collected.
4757,Where to find centers that perform Endometrial biopsy?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Endometrial biopsy
4758,What are the symptoms of Germ cell tumor?,"The symptoms of germ cell tumor depend on the location of the cancer. Early cancer does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, patients may feel the following symptoms.
Pain in the affected area
Constipation
Urinary retention
Cough and/or difficulty breathing
Headache
Vaginal bleeding
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4759,Who is at highest risk for Germ cell tumor ?,"At present, the risk factors for the development of a germ cell tumor are not known."
4760,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Germ cell tumor ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of germ cell tumor develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe pain
Severe constipation
Urinary retention
Severe difficulty breathing
Severe headache
Large vaginal bleeding"
4761,What to expect if I have Germ cell tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of germ cell tumor depends on the following:
Whether the tumor is benign or cancerous
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery
The stage of the cancer: the size and location of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the tumor
Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred
The patient’s general health"
4762,What are the Symptoms of Gonadoblastoma?,"Gonadoblastoma has no specific signs and symptoms. It is a tumor usually arising from a maldeveloped gonad and it can manifest with non-specific symptoms such as:
Excess hair overgrowth Delayed onset of menstrual bleeding Abnormal shape of genitalia
It may also present as a lower abdominal mass in women or growing mass in the testicles causing discomfort in men."
4763,What Causes gonadoblastoma?,"The exact cause of gonadoblastoma is not clear, but it usually arises in the setting of maldeveloped sex organs. There is also a hypothesis regarding the presence of a putative gene called TSPY gene. Although the exact mechanism of its role in the pathogenesis of the disease is not clear, it has been observed that the product of this gene increased in the gonadoblastoma."
4764,Who is at highest risk for Gonadoblastoma ?,"Individuals with sex organ maldevelopment disorders are at highest risk of developing gonadoblastoma. Sex organ maldevelopment disorders are referred to disorders manifesting with an abnormal shape of genitalia during infancy or sexual organ developmental disorders during puberty such as delayed onset of menstruation, excess hair overgrowth."
4765,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gonadoblastoma ?,"Individuals with a known diagnosis of sexual maldevelopment disorders such as:
Androgen insensitivity syndrome Swyer syndrome Turner syndrome Frasier syndrome Denys-Drash syndrome 9p partial monosomy
should be screened for the presence of gonadoblastoma."
4766,Where to find Medical Care for Gonadoblastoma?,Medical care for gonadoblastoma can be found here.
4767,What to expect if I have Gonadoblastoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Gonadoblastoma prognosis is excellent after the surgical removal of the tumor. In the case of a coexisting malignant tumor, the prognosis depends on the staging of that tumor."
4768,What are the symptoms of Granulosa cell tumour?,"Ovarian cancer symptoms are often vague. Women and their doctors often blame the symptoms on other, more common conditions. By the time the cancer is diagnosed, the tumor has often spread beyond the ovaries.
You should see your doctor if you have the following symptoms on a daily basis for more than a few weeks:
Bloating Difficulty eating or feeling full quickly Pelvic or abdominal pain
Other symptoms are also seen with ovarian cancer. However, these symptoms are also common in women who do not have cancer:
Abnormal menstrual cycles Digestive symptoms: Constipation Increased gas Indigestion Lack of appetite Nausea and vomiting Sense of pelvic heaviness Swollen abdomen or belly Unexplained back pain that worsens over time Vaginal bleeding Vague lower abdominal discomfort Weight gain or loss
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Excessive hair growth Increased urinary frequency or urgency"
4769,What causes Granulosa cell tumour?,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer among women, and it causes more deaths than any other type of female reproductive cancer.
The cause is unknown."
4770,Who is at highest risk for Granulosa cell tumour ?,"The risk for developing ovarian cancer appears to be affected by several factors. The more children a woman has and the earlier in life she gives birth, the lower her risk for ovarian cancer. Certain genes defects (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are responsible for a small number of ovarian cancer cases. Women with a personal history of breast cancer or a family history of breast or ovarian cancer have an increased risk for ovarian cancer.
Women who take estrogen replacement only (not with progesterone) for 5 years or more seem to have a higher risk of ovarian cancer. Birth control pills, however, decrease the risk of ovarian cancer.
Studies suggest that fertility drugs do not increase the risk for ovarian cancer.
Older women are at highest risk for developing ovarian cancer. Most deaths from ovarian cancer occur in women age 55 and older."
4771,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Granulosa cell tumour ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are a woman over 40 years old who has not recently had a pelvic examination. Routine pelvic examinations are recommended for all women over 20 years old.
Call for an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of ovarian cancer."
4772,What to expect if I have Granulosa cell tumour  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Ovarian cancer is rarely diagnosed in its early stages. It is usually quite advanced by the time diagnosis is made
About 3 out of 4 women with ovarian cancer survive 1 year after diagnosis. Nearly half of women live longer than 5 years after diagnosis. If diagnosis is made early in the disease and treatment is received before the cancer spreads outside the ovary, the 5-year survival rate is very high"
4773,What Causes Hirsutism?,"All women normally produce low levels of male hormones (androgens). Unwanted hair growth (hirsutism) in women may occur when the body makes too much male hormones.
In most cases, the exact cause is never identified. It tends to run in families. In general, hirsutism is a harmless condition. But many women find it bothersome, or even embarrassing.
A common cause is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS and other hormonal conditions that cause unwanted hair growth may also have acne, problems with menstrual periods, trouble losing weight, a deeper voice similar to that of men, and diabetes. If these symptoms start suddenly, there may be a tumor that releases male hormones.
The following other causes of unwanted hair growth are rare:
Tumor or cancer of the adrenal gland Tumor or cancer of the ovary Cushing's syndrome Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hyperthecosis (a condition in which the ovaries produce too much male hormones) Medications (testosterone, danazol, anabolic steroids, glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, minoxidil, phenytoin)
Rarely, a woman with hirsutism will have normal levels of male hormones, and the specific cause of the unwanted hair growth cannot be identified."
4774,When To Seek Urgent Medical Care?,"Call your doctor if:
The hair grows rapidly. The hair growth is associated with male features such as acne, deepening of voice, increased muscle mass, and decreased breast size. You are concerned that a medication may be worsening unwanted hair growth."
4775,Where To Find Medical Care For Hirsutism?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Hirsutism)
4776,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hormone replacement therapy for menopause ?,"It is important to have regular checkups with your health care provider when taking hormone therapy.
If you have vaginal bleeding or other unusual symptoms during hormone therapy, call your health care provider."
4777,What diseases are caused by HPV?,"HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many different types of HPV, and many do not cause problems. However, certain types of HPV can lead to:
Cervical cancer in women Genital warts in men and women Cancer of the penis or anus in men"
4778,Who needs HPV vaccine?,"Gardasil is approved for:
Females ages 9-26 to protect against cervical cancer and to prevent genital warts Males ages 9 - 26 to prevent genital warts
Cervarix is approved for:
Females age 10 - 26 to help protect against cervical cancer
Girls ages 11 and 12 should receive the HPV vaccine series:
The vaccine is given in three shots over a 6-month period. (The second and third doses are given 2 and 6 months after the first dose.) One brand of vaccine can be substituted for another in the 3-dose series. The HPV vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. Girls as young as age 9 can receive the vaccine if their doctor recommends it.
Girls and women ages 13 - 26:
Those who have not received the HPV vaccine in the past should get a series of three vaccines. Those who have not completed the full vaccine series should catch up on missed doses. (Note: Some experts do not recommend that women between ages 19 and 26 receive catch-up doses of this vaccine. Talk with your provider if you are in this age group.)
Boys and men ages 9 - 26:
May receive Gardasil to reduce the chance of becoming infected with genital and anal warts. The vaccine is not yet being recommended for all boys and men up to age 26. The vaccine can prevent genital warts in men and decrease the risk for cancer of the penis and anus.
Pregnant women should not receive this vaccine. However, there have been no problems found in women who received the vaccine during pregnancy, before they knew they were pregnant."
4779,When to seek urgent medical care when I have HPV vaccine ?,You aren't sure whether you or your child should receive the HPV vaccine You or your child develops complications or severe symptoms after getting an HPV vaccine You have other questions or concerns about the HPV vaccine
4780,What to expect if I have HPV vaccine  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The HPV vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV that lead to cervical cancer. Girls and women should still receive regular screening (Pap tests) to look for any early signs of cervical cancer.
The HPV vaccine does not protect against other infections that can be spread during sexual contact."
4781,What diseases are caused by HPV?,"HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many different types of HPV, and many do not cause problems. However, certain types of HPV can lead to:
Cervical cancer in women Genital warts in men and women Cancer of the penis or anus in men"
4782,Who needs HPV vaccine?,"Gardasil is approved for:
Females ages 9-26 to protect against cervical cancer and to prevent genital warts Males ages 9 - 26 to prevent genital warts
Cervarix is approved for:
Females age 10 - 26 to help protect against cervical cancer
Girls ages 11 and 12 should receive the HPV vaccine series:
The vaccine is given in three shots over a 6-month period. (The second and third doses are given 2 and 6 months after the first dose.) One brand of vaccine can be substituted for another in the 3-dose series. The HPV vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. Girls as young as age 9 can receive the vaccine if their doctor recommends it.
Girls and women ages 13 - 26:
Those who have not received the HPV vaccine in the past should get a series of three vaccines. Those who have not completed the full vaccine series should catch up on missed doses. (Note: Some experts do not recommend that women between ages 19 and 26 receive catch-up doses of this vaccine. Talk with your provider if you are in this age group.)
Boys and men ages 9 - 26:
May receive Gardasil to reduce the chance of becoming infected with genital and anal warts. The vaccine is not yet being recommended for all boys and men up to age 26. The vaccine can prevent genital warts in men and decrease the risk for cancer of the penis and anus.

4785,How is the Hysterectomy done?,"During a hysterectomy, your doctor may remove the entire uterus or just part of it. The fallopian tubes (the tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus) and ovaries may also be removed.
Types of hysterectomy:
Partial (or supracervical) hysterectomy: The upper part of the uterus is removed. The cervix is left in place. Total hysterectomy: The entire uterus and cervix are removed. Radical hysterectomy: The uterus, upper part of the vagina, and tissue on both sides of the cervix are removed. This is most often done if you have cancer.
There are many different ways to perform a hysterectomy. It may be done through a surgical cut in either the belly (abdomen) or vagina.
Your doctor will help you decide which type of hysterectomy is best for you. The specific procedure depends on your medical history and reason for the surgery."
4786,Who needs Hysterectomy?,"There are many reasons a woman may need a hysterectomy. The procedure may be recommended if you have:
Cancer of the uterus, most often endometrial cancer Cancer of the cervix or a precancerous condition of the cervix called cervical dysplasia Cancer of the ovary Childbirth complications, such as uncontrolled bleeding Long-term (chronic) pelvic pain Severe endometriosis that does not get better with other treatments Severe, long-term vaginal bleeding that cannot be controlled by medicines or other surgeries Slipping of the uterus into the vagina (uterine prolapse) Tumors in the uterus, such as uterine fibroids Adenomyosis, which causes heavy, painful periods
Hysterectomy is a major surgery. It is possible that your condition may be treated without this major surgery. Talk with your doctor about all your treatment options. Less invasive procedures include:
Uterine artery embolization Pelvic laparoscopy Endometrial ablation"
4787,Where to find centers that perform Hysterectomy?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Hysterectomy
4788,What to expect if I have Hysterectomy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How long it takes you to recover depends on the type of hysterectomy. Recovery may take anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks. Average recovery times are:
Abdominal hysterectomy: 4 - 6 weeks Vaginal hysterectomy: 3 - 4 weeks Robot-assisted hysterectomy: 2 - 4 weeks
A hysterectomy will cause menopause if you also have your ovaries removed. Removal of the ovaries can also lead to a decreased sex drive. Your doctor may recommend estrogen replacement therapy."
4789,What causes Mastalgia?,"Some amount of breast tenderness is normal. The discomfort may be caused by hormone changes from:
Menopause (unless a woman is taking hormone replacement therapy) Menstruation and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) Pregnancy -- breast tenderness tends to be more common during the first trimester and in women who become pregnant at a young age Puberty in both girls and boys
Soon after having a baby, a woman's breasts may become swollen with milk. This can be very painful. If you also have an area of redness, call your health care provider.
Breastfeeding itself may also cause breast pain.
Fibrocystic breast changes are a common cause of breast pain. Fibrocystic breast tissue contains lumps that tend to be more tender just before your menstrual period.
Certain medications may also cause breast pain, including:
Anadrol Chlorpromazine Diuretics Digitalis preparations Methyldopa (Aldomet) Spironolactone (Aldactone)
Shingles can lead to pain in the breast if the painful blistering rash appears on the skin over one of your breasts."
4790,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mastalgia ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
Bloody or clear discharge from your nipple Given birth within the last week and your breasts are swollen or hard Noticed a new lump with the pain that does not go away after your menstrual period Persistent, unexplained breast pain Signs of a breast infection, including local redness, pus, or fever"
4791,What are the symptoms of Miscarriage?,"Low back pain or abdominal pain that is dull, sharp, or cramping Tissue or clot-like material that passes from the vagina Vaginal bleeding, with or without abdominal cramps"
4792,What causes Miscarriage?,"Most miscarriages are caused by chromosome problems that make it impossible for the baby to develop. Usually, these problems are unrelated to the mother or father's genes.
Other possible causes for miscarriage include:
Drug and alcohol abuse Exposure to environmental toxins Hormone problems Infection Obesity Physical problems with the mother's reproductive organs Problem with the body's immune response Serious body-wide (systemic) diseases in the mother (such as uncontrolled diabetes) Smoking
It is estimated that up to half of all fertilized eggs die and are lost (aborted) spontaneously, usually before the woman knows she is pregnant.
Among those women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is about 15-20%. Most miscarriages occur during the first 7 weeks of pregnancy. The rate of miscarriage drops after the baby's heart beat is detected."
4793,Who is at highest risk for Miscarriage ?,"The risk for miscarriage is higher in women:
Older age, with increases beginning by 30, becoming greater between 35 and 40, and highest after 40 Who have had previous miscarriages?"
4794,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Miscarriage ?,"Call your health care provider if vaginal bleeding with or without cramping occurs during pregnancy.
Call your health care provider if you are pregnant and notice tissue or clot-like material passed vaginally (any such material should be collected and brought in for examination)."
4795,How is the Pap smear done?,"You will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups. The health care provider will insert an instrument (called a speculum) into the vagina and open it slightly to see inside the vaginal canal. Cells are gently scraped from the cervix area, and sent to a lab for examination."
4796,Who needs Pap smear?,"The Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. Most cervical cancers can be detected early if women has routine Pap smears and pelvic examinations.
Screening should start at age 21. After the first test:
Woman should have a Pap smear ever 2 years to check for cervical cancer. If you are over age 30 or your Pap smears have been negative for 3 times in a row, your doctor may tell you that you only need a Pap smear every 3 years. If you or your sexual partner have other new partners, then you should have a Pap smear every 2 years. After age 65-70, most women can stop having Pap smears as long as they have had three negative tests within the past 10 years. If you have a new sexual partner after age 65, you should begin having Pap smear screening again.
You may not need to have a Pap smear if you have had a total hysterectomy (uterus and cervix removed) and do not have a history of cervical dysplasia (abnormal cells), cervical cancer, or other pelvic cancer."
4797,How to prepare for Pap smear?,"Tell your health care provider if you:
Are taking any medications or birth control pills Have had an abnormal Pap smear Might be pregnant
Avoid the following for 24 hours before the test:
Douching Having intercourse Taking a bath Using tampons
Avoid scheduling your Pap smear while you have your period (are menstruating), because it may affect the accuracy of the Pap smear. If you are having abnormal bleeding, your doctor may still recommend you have the test done.
Empty your bladder just before the test."
4798,What do I experience during the procedure?,"A Pap smear may cause some discomfort, similar to menstrual cramps. You may also feel some pressure during the exam.
You may bleed a little bit after the test."
4799,Where to find centers that perform Pap smear?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Pap smear
4800,What to expect if I have Pap smear  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The Pap smear test is not 100% accurate. Cervical cancer may be missed in a small number of cases. Fortunately, cervical cancer develops very slowly in most women and follow-up Pap smears should identify worrisome changes in time for treatment.
Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines you are taking. Some, including estrogen and progestins, may affect the result of your Pap smear."
4801,What are the symptoms of Uterine prolapse?,"A feeling as if sitting on a small ball Difficult or painful sexual intercourse Frequent urination or a sudden, urgent need to empty the bladder Low backache Pain during intercourse Protruding of the uterus and cervix through the vaginal opening Repeated bladder infections Sensation of heaviness or pulling in the pelvis Vaginal bleeding or increased vaginal discharge
Many of the symptoms are worse when standing or sitting for long periods of time."
4802,What causes Uterine prolapse?,"The uterus is held in position in the pelvis by muscles, special ligaments, and other tissue,. The uterus drops into the vaginal canal (prolapses) when these muscles and connective tissues weaken."
4803,Who is at highest risk for Uterine prolapse ?,"Uterine prolapse usually happens in women who have had one or more vaginal births. Normal aging and lack of estrogen hormone after menopause may also cause uterine prolapse Chronic cough and obesity increase the pressure on the pelvic floor and may contribute to the prolapse. Uterine prolapse can also be caused by a pelvic tumor, although this is rare. Chronic constipation and the pushing associated with it can worsen uterine prolapse."
4804,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Uterine prolapse ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of uterine prolapse.
4805,What to expect if I have Uterine prolapse  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most women with mild uterine prolapse do not have bothersome symptoms and don't need treatment.
Vaginal pessaries can be effective for many women with uterine prolapse.
Surgery usually provides excellent results, however, some women may require treatment again in the future."
4806,What are the symptoms of Vaginal cysts?,"Vaginal cysts usually do not cause symptoms, although there may be a soft lump felt in the vaginal wall or protruding from the vagina. Some women with vaginal cysts may have discomfort during sexual intercourse or difficulty inserting tampons."
4807,What causes Vaginal cysts?,"There are several types of vaginal cysts, which can range in size from the size of a pea to that of an orange. Vaginal inclusion cysts are the most common. These may form as a result of trauma sustained by the vaginal walls or following an obstetric or gynecologic procedure, when the lining of the vagina doesn't heal to its normal smoothness.
Gartner's duct cysts develop in the space occupied by the Gartner's duct, usually on the side walls of the vagina. This duct is active during fetal development but ordinarily disappears after birth. In some cases, however, portions of the duct may collect fluid and develop into a vaginal wall cyst later in life.
Benign tumors of the vagina are uncommon and are usually made up of cysts."
4808,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vaginal cysts ?,Call your health care provider if a lump is felt inside the vagina or protruding from the vagina.
4809,What to expect if I have Vaginal cysts  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is generally good. Frequently cysts remain small and require no treatment. When surgically removed, the cysts usually do not return."
4810,What causes Vaginal discharge?,"The following situations can increase the amount of normal vaginal discharge:
Emotional stress Ovulation (the production and release of an egg from your ovary in the middle of your menstrual cycle) Pregnancy Sexual excitement
Abnormal vaginal discharge may be due to:
Atrophic vaginitis: seen in women who have gone through menopause and have low estrogen levels Bacterial vaginosis (BV): Bacteria that normally live in the vagina overgrow, causing a grey discharge and fishy odor that worsen after sexual intercourse. BV is usually not sexually transmitted. Cervical or vaginal cancer: rarely a cause of excess discharge Chlamydia Desquamative vaginitis and lichen planus Forgotten tampon or foreign body Gonorrhea Other infections and sexually transmitted diseases Trichomoniasis Vaginal yeast infection"
4811,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vaginal discharge ?,"Call your doctor right away if:
Your discharge is associated with fever or pain in your pelvis or abdomen. You have been exposed to a sexual partner with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or other sexually transmitted disease. You have increased thirst or appetite, unexplained weight loss, increased urinary frequency, or fatigue: these may be signs of diabetes.
Also call if:
A child who has not reached puberty has vaginal discharge. You think that your discharge may be related to a medication. You are concerned that you may have a sexually transmitted disease or you are unsure of possible exposure. Your symptoms worsen or last longer than 1 week despite home care measures. You have blisters or other lesions on your vagina or vulva (exterior genitalia). You have burning with urination or other urinary symptoms. You may have a urinary tract infection."

Don't skip levels (for example, second-level followed by fourth-level). A Table of Contents will automatically be added to an article that has four or more sections. If appropriate, place subsections in an appropriate order. If listing countries, place them in alphabetical order rather than, say, relative to population of OECD countries, or some random order. ==New section== ===Subsection=== ====Sub-subsection==== A single newline generally has no effect on the layout. These can be used to separate sentences within a paragraph. Some editors find that this aids editing and improves the function diff (used internally to compare different versions of a page).

4821,What are the symptoms of Bronchiolitis obliterans?,"Bronchiolitis obliterans usually causes a dry cough and shortness of breath, especially on exertion, two to eight weeks after toxic fume exposure or a respiratory illness. It may be several months or years until it presents itself after a transplant.
Fatigue and wheezing in the absence of a cold or asthma are other symptoms of this lung disease."
4822,What causes Bronchiolitis obliterans?,"The disease can be caused by breathing in irritant fumes, such as chlorine, ammonia, oxides of nitrogen or sulfur dioxide. Diacetyl, a chemical used to provide butter flavor in many foods, has also been suspected of causing bronchiolitis obliterans in workers who manufacture it or mix it into foods, such as butter-flavored popcorn. Bronchiolitis obliterans also can result from respiratory infections, a connective tissue disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, a medication reaction, and after a bone marrow, lung or heart-lung transplant. Also, the disease may be idiopathic (without a known cause).
Another similarly named disease, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, is a completely different disease."
4823,How Can WikiDoc Meet These Needs?,"The WikiDoc team has come up with the'calculator project' intended to solve these problems. The calculator project is focused on creating calculators for the risk assessment tools. With the use of calculators, a health care provider can rapidly determine the prognosis and treatment goals of a specific medical condition and institute appropriate actions based on the interpretation. This project is intended for interns, residents, attending physicians, hospitalists, specialists, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to contribute their knowledge and clinical experience. This project aims at improving the quality of making diagnoses and treating medical conditions, reducing the variability in treatment, and to improve the overall quality of patient care. WikiDoc welcomes your involvement in contributing to this project."
4824,How Can You Help WikiDoc Meet These Needs?,"Your participation as an Assistant Editor-in-Chief in this project is very important to us at WikiDoc. You are welcome to apply if you are an intern, resident, attending physician, specialist, nurse or a nurse practitioner. It is required of you to have a strong grasp of medical knowledge, and preferably, a prior residency training and experience in order to apply."
4825,Why put an article in a category?,"At some point it becomes useful to classify the information according to categories. For instance, you might want to add an article on acute MI to the category of cardiology. Acute MI would then be included with all the other articles related to the subject of cardiology in this category. All the articles in a category can come together to forming a living textbook of a given topic. Categories are also used to list all the articles that need work for instance, like the addition of an overview statement."
4826,Where do I type in the references?,"Usually you would type a number in the text like this (1) or this 1 which refers to a reference you would like to cite. You would then type in the reference at the end of the article. This is not the preferred method in WikiDoc.
WikiDoc features an automated reference manager. The advantages of this reference manager are that:
The references are numbered automatically! When you move the text, the reference moves with it! You can click on the reference and go directly to the article!
Unlike the usual format where you type in the references at the end of the article, when you use the WikiDoc reference manager, you insert code for the reference right after the material you want to add a reference to. You use a software program to add in the references. The next section describes how to use the software program."
4827,What if I don't want to use the reference manager? What if I just want to type the references in myself?,"You are not required to use the reference manager. You can do the following:
Step 1: Place a <ref>... </ref> immediately after the sentence where you want a footnote number to appear.
Step 2: Type the text of the note between the ref tags. For example if I typed this
It would appear as this
Note: If you intend on using the same manual reference more than once, you will need to assign a name to the reference. You can do this by writing <ref name=""anythingyouwanthere"">... </ref>. Your name can be anything you want. Without a name, every manual reference will be viewed as a unique reference. This means that a reference used multiple times will show up as multiple references instead of just the one."
4828,How do I make the references appear at the bottom of the article?,"Put the following code in:
This will generate your references in small font, in two columns, with links to the original article and abstract. It will return text that looks like this:"
4829,What are the symptoms of cyanotic congenital heart disease?,"Some heart defects cause major problems right after birth. Others cause few, if any, problems until adulthood.
One symptom is cyanosis, which usually seen as a bluish color of the lips, fingers, and toes. It may occur while the child is resting, or only when the child is active.
Some children have breathing problems (dyspnea). They may get into a squatting position after physical activity to relieve breathlessness.
Others have spells, in which their bodies are suddenly starved of oxygen. During these spells, symptoms may include:
Anxiety Breathing too quickly (hyperventilation) Sudden increase in bluish color to the skin
Infants may get tired or sweat while feeding and may not gain as much weight as they should.
Fainting (syncope) and chest pain may occur.
Other symptoms depend on the type of cyanotic heart disease, and may include:
Feeding problems or reduced appetite, leading to poor growth Grayish skin Puffy eyes or face Tiredness all the time"
4830,What causes cyanotic congenital heart disease?,"Normally, blood returns from the body and flows through the heart and lungs
Blood that is low in oxygen (blue blood) returns from the body to the right side of the heart. The right side of the heart then pumps the blood to the lungs, where it picks up more oxygen and becomes red. The oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the left side of the heart. From there, it is pumped to the rest of the body.
Heart defects that children are born with can change the way blood flows through the heart and lungs. This abnormal blood flow is called shunting.
The blood that is pumped out to the body is lower in oxygen. Less oxygen delivered to the body can make the skin look blue (cyanosis)
Many of these heart defects involve the heart valves. Heart valves are found between the heart and the large blood vessels that bring blood to and from the heart. These valves open up enough for blood to flow through. Then they close, keeping blood from flowing backward.
Heart valve defects that can cause cyanosis include:
Tricuspid valve (the valve between the two chambers on the right side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. Pulmonary valve (the valve between the heart and the lungs) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. Aortic valve (the valve between the heart and the blood vessel to the rest of the body) is unable to open wide enough.
Other heart defects that may cause cyanosis include:
Coarctation or complete interruption of the aorta Ebstein's anomaly Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Tetralogy of Fallot Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection Transposition of the great arteries Truncus arteriosus
Cyanotic heart diseases may be caused by:
Chemical exposure Genetic and chromosomal syndromes, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Noonan syndrome Infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy Poorly controlled blood sugar levels in women who have diabetes during pregnancy Medications prescribed by your doctor or bought on your own and used during pregnancy Street drugs used during pregnancy"
4831,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Congenital heart disease cyanotic ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby has:
Bluish skin (cyanosis) or grayish skin Breathing difficulty Chest pain or other pain Dizziness, fainting, or heart palpitations Feeding problems or reduced appetite Fever, nausea, or vomiting Puffy eyes or face Tiredness all the time"
4832,What to expect if I have Congenital heart disease cyanotic  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outlook depends on the specific disorder.
4833,How Can WikiDoc Meet These Needs?,"The WikiDoc team has come up with the'critical pathways project' intended to solve these problems. The critical pathways project is focused on creating standardized treatment protocols for the management of medical conditions by applying evidence-based medical approaches to patient care. With the use of critical pathways, a health care provider can rapidly determine the treatment goals of a specific medical condition and institute appropriate actions in a chronological sequence with optimal efficiency. This project is intended for interns, residents, attending physicians, hospitalists, specialists, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to contribute their knowledge and clinical experience.

4838,What are the symptoms of fibroadenoma?,"Most people with fibroadenoma do not present with any symptoms. Majority of the time, people visit their health care provider due to a mass felt in the breast. But, some patients may present with breast pain and may notice a difference in the size of one breast compared to the other."
4839,What causes fibroadenoma?,The exact cause of fibroadenoma is unknown. It is believed that it may be related to the tissues in the breast being extra sensitive to the hormone estrogen.
4840,Who is at highest risk for Fibroadenoma ?,"Certain factors can predispose to the development of fibroadenoma. They include:
Women younger than 35 years Being overweight People who have had benign breast disease in the past A family history of multiple fibroadenomas. This risk factor predisposes patients to developing multiple fibroadenomas. Taking oral contraceptives before the age of 20."
4841,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Fibroadenoma ?,"If you notice any changes in size of the breast mass, pain or change in the pain pattern, you should contact your health care provider."
4842,What to expect if I have Fibroadenoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome of fibroadenoma is excellent with the survival rate being equal to that of the general population. Most fibroadenomas resolve completely. This is very common in the adolescent population. There is a slight chance of developing breast cancer.

4844,Where do I type in the references?,"Usually you would type a number in the text like this (1) or this 1 which refers to a reference you would like to cite. You would then type in the reference at the end of the article. This is not the preferred method in WikiDoc.
WikiDoc features an automated reference manager. The advantages of this reference manager are that:
The references are numbered automatically! When you move the text, the reference moves with it! You can click on the reference and go directly to the article!
Unlike the usual format where you type in the references at the end of the article, when you use the WikiDoc reference manager, you insert code for the reference right after the material you want to add a reference to. You use a software program to add in the references. The next section describes how to use the software program."
4845,What if I don't want to use the reference manager? What if I just want to type the references in myself?,"You are not required to use the reference manager. You can do the following:
Step 1: Place a <ref>... </ref> immediately after the sentence where you want a footnote number to appear.
Step 2: Type the text of the note between the ref tags. For example if I typed this
It would appear as this
Note: If you intend on using the same manual reference more than once, you will need to assign a name to the reference. You can do this by writing <ref name=""anythingyouwanthere"">... </ref>. Your name can be anything you want. Without a name, every manual reference will be viewed as a unique reference. This means that a reference used multiple times will show up as multiple references instead of just the one."
4846,How do I make the references appear at the bottom of the article?,"Put the following code in:
This will generate your references in small font, in two columns, with links to the original article and abstract. It will return text that looks like this:"
4847,How Do I Search For The Page I Want to Create?,"First you need to search for the disease name of the page you are creating to see if the page already exists. For more information on searching, click here. You should also search for synonyms or other names of the disease, so you do not duplicate content. If the page already exists, but is not microchaptered, you may create a new microchaptered page for the disease and then re-organize the old contents into a microchaptered page. Only microchapter the page if it is over one-and-a-half pages in length, and there is enough or will be enough content to be put into microchapters. This can be done by following the instructions below to create a microchapter template, and then simply copying and pasting the information you are re-organizing into the standardized microchapters."
4848,How Do I Create A Microchapter Template?,"If the disease page does not exist, you will create a new microchaptered page using the following directions. For example, if you were creating a page on jaundice that did not exist: First you need to go to the page WikiDoc Disease Microchapter Template which is listed on the home page under ""Advanced Editing"". Click on the edit tab, and copy all of the text in the edit box. Type into the main wikidoc search box ""Template:Jaundice"" (without the quotation marks). Click on where it says ""create the page Template:Jaundice on this Wiki"". Click on the edit box, and paste all of the microchapter template information into the edit box. The top of the edit box has two blank boxes, the top one with binocular icons next to it, and the bottom one with red arrows next to it. In the top box put ""type page name here"", and in the bottom box type the name of the disease page you are creating. Click on the red arrows at the right side of the bottom box, and continue to click on it until you get to end of the edit box. This will put the disease name in all the microchapter navigation boxes, so that they link to the appropriate pages. Remove cells that are not relevant to the disease that you are working on. Click save at the bottom of the edit box. You now have a microchapter navigation template which will be inserted in all of the microchapter pages you create."
4849,How Do I Create the Microchaptered Home Page?,"Search in the Wikidoc search box for the disease name. It is a good idea to search for synonyms of the disease name, so that if someone has already created a similar page, you can add new content, or incorporate the old content into a new page. For example, for jaundice, search for ""Jaundice"", then click on where it says ""Create the page Jaundice on this Wiki"". You would then type in the edit box {{Jaundice}}. Click save at the bottom of the edit box, and the main page should show the microchapters listed on the right side of the main page. You will use the microchapter template in all of the subsequent microchapter pages you eventually make by typing into the edit box {{jaundice}}. This leads to ease of navigation, as regardless of which microchapter page you are viewing, you can easily click back to the home page or to other microchapter pages.
The home page also contains links to the individual microchapter pages, in the appropriate order, as seen here. For this you would type into the edit box of the home page ==Jaundice historical perspective|Historical Perspective==. On the left side of the vertical line in the brackets is the link to the page, and on the right side is how we want the link to appear on the page. It would look like this on the main page Historical Perspective. You can use the template found here. Copy all the template information in the edit box. Paste it into the home page of the microchaptered you are creating. Use search and replace; so put ""Type page name here"" in the top window, and the name of the disease (ie; Jaundice) in the lower box. Click the red button on the right side of these boxes to replace the terms. Remove links that are not relevant to the disease that you are creating. The links on the home page should match, and be in the same order, as the cells in the microchapter navigation template.
For more information on creating links, click here. As you can see, although the microchapter pages only have the first letter of the heading capitalized, the way that the links appear on the home page is different. It is important to maintain consistency, so as an example to reference capitalizations and correct nomenclature, click here."
4850,How Do I Create the Individual Pages Within a Microchaptered Page?,"The home page will show the microchapter navigation template on the right of the screen, and the headings of the microchapters in the middle section of the page, which will also link to the microchapters. To view this on a home page, and practice navigating a microchaptered page, click here. As you create new microchapter pages, you will create a link on the home page. To create a new microchapter page, click on the appropriate section within the microchapter navigation template on the home page. Click on ""Create the page _____"" on this wiki!"" Create the page using the appropriate template listed on the main page. Be sure to include the microchapter navigation template {{jaundice}} on each microchapter page."
4851,What is a user page?,"Every user account on WikiDoc has an identity page called the user page. This page serves as a way to introduce individual users to the editing community. Unlike most pages that have standard convention, this page is the one place you can express your creativity."
4852,How do I find my user page?,"Your user page can be accessed at the top right corner of every page.
Your user page will have to be created by you. It is your choice what information you would like displayed. You have the ability to delete any information you do not want shared with the editing community."
4853,How can I personalize my user page?,"There are lots of ways you can personalize your page!
Below is a template for how to code a user page for all of these. If you copy the code below and paste it to your page, you can replace the information with your own.

4854,When do I need to redirect a page?,"Sometimes a topic will have multiple names or abbreviations, and you will want to direct them all to one page.
For example take the page ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction. The names STEMI, MI, Acute MI, Myocardial Infarction, AMI all are redirected to the page ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction.
To redirect a page A to a different page B (also called target page), enter the following redirecting command at the top of redirecting page.
For example, to redirect the MI page (redirecting page) to the ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction page (target page), edit the MI page and enter:
To redirect a page A to a section C(target section) in page B, enter the following redirecting command at the top of redirecting page.
For example, to redirect the Holosystolic Murmur page (redirecting page) to the Holosystolic (Pansystolic) Murmurs section (target section) in page Heart murmur, edit the Holosystolic Murmur page and enter:
If a spelling mistake occurs in a title such as STElevation Myocardial Infarction, it is not possible for a regular user to move the page with all its history. It is however possible to create a redirect. A new page ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction must be created first, and the contents from the old page must be copied manually. Then the old page STElevation Myocardial Infarction must be edited and its source code replaced by:
Don't make (a redirect that points to another redirect); they don't work, they create slow, unpleasant experiences for the reader, and they make the navigational structure of the site confusing.

4869,What About More Sophisticated Tools for Editing?,"To access a more sophisticated tools set for editing, create a page called User:USERNAME/monobook.js. If your username was Johndoe the name of the page would be User:Johndoe/monobook.js
On this page type or paste the following text (it's a template and activates an editing compute program): {{subst:wikEd}}
If you are logged in, you can also access it here: Special:Mypage/monobook.js
Template:WikiDoc Sources"
4870,Why log in?,"You don't have to log in to read any MediaWiki wiki. You don't even have to log in to edit a MediaWiki wiki - anyone can edit almost anypage, even without logging in.
However, it's still a good idea to log in, for these reasons:
Other users will be able to recognise you by your username when you make changes to pages. As a ""name"" an IP address is somewhat clumsy. Also, if you use computers at different locations (home, office, internet cafe, etc.) you have a different IP-address in each case; even in the same location, depending on the Internet connection, the IP-address may be different each time. Therefore a username is better to maintain an identity. You will have your own user page where you can write a bit about yourself, and a user talk page which you can use to communicate with other users. You will be able to mark an edit as minor, which avoids inconvenience for other users. You will be able to keep track of changes to pages you are interested in using a watch list. If you choose to give an email address, other users will be able to contact you by email. This feature is anonymous - the user who emails you will not know your email address. You don't have to give your email address if you don't want to. Check the privacy policy of the individual site you're visiting, if any (for example, Wikipedia's draft privacy policy) You will be able to rename pages. You will be able to set your own preferences, to change things such as: The number of pages displayed in Recent changes The fonts, colours and layout of the site, by using different skins."

Compared to normal arterioles on the left, the arterioles from a patient with hyertension (middle) show moderate periarteriolar thickening and fibrosis. Shown on the right is a patient with HCM in which there is even more signficant periarteriolar thickening and fibrosis. This thickening of the wall of the intramyocardial arterioles leads to an increased wall/lumen ratio, subendocardial ischemia and impaired coronary flow reserve.
Use this code:"
4874,Who can contribute to the Incidence and Prevalence Project?,"The Incidence and Prevalence Project is intended for editors at an Assistant Editor-in-Chief level or higher. It is specifically designed for students of all levels (high school, college, medical school, and doctoral programs) to help hone their quantitative research skills."
4875,Why Are Some Links Black Instead of Blue?,"WikiDoc automatically checks to see if the target of a wikilink exists. If the page doesn't exist, the link is black and the link leads to the editing screen so that the page can be created/edited."
4876,What is the Educational Level of the Audience?,Content on the patient information page should be pitched at the 5th or 6th grade educational level.
4877,How Should the Page be Structured?,"In order to promote consistency, there is a standard structure to the patient pages. We will use the pericarditis page as an example how to structure pages throughout this tutorial.
At the top of each patient page there is what is known as a ""template"". This template is essentially a computer program. It allows navigation to and from selected physician pages. The template is surrounded by brackets and looks like this:
{{Pericarditis}}
The next line of code indicates that the physician page of WikiDoc can be found ""here"". Again using the pericaridits page as an example, the code would look like this:
'''For the WikiDoc page for this topic, click Pericarditis|here'''
In order to promote consistency, the following topics are generally covered on each patient information page. Again we use the example from pericarditis to show the coding that you would use to create these traditional sections:
==What is pericarditis?== ==What are the symptoms of pericarditis?== ==What causes Pericarditis?== ==Who is at highest risk?== ==When to seek urgent medical care== ==Treatment options== ==Where to find medical care for Pericarditis== http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q={{urlencode:{{#if:{{{1|}}}|{{{1}}}|Pericarditis}}}}&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=65.008093,112.148438&ie=UTF8&ll=37.0625,-95.677068&spn=91.690419,149.414063&z=2&source=embed Directions to Hospitals Treating Pericarditis that the specter. ==What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis)== ==Possible complications== ==Sources=="

4883,What are the symptoms of pleomorphic adenoma?,"Patients usually present with a history of swelling, which is gradual in onset and painless. The majority of patients with pleomorphic adenoma are asymptomatic. The symptoms mainly depend upon the size, location and the potential to undergo malignant transformation. When pleomorphic adenoma arises from the parotid gland patients present with: Dry mouth Difficulty in swallowing Hoarseness Dyspnea Difficulty in chewing When the tumor arises from the lacrimal glands patients presents with: Diplopia Proptosis Slight fullness in the temporal upper eyelid Visual impairment"
4884,What causes (disease name)?,There are no established causes for the development of pleomorphic adenoma. However some clonal chromosomal abnormalities with aberrations involving 8q12 and 12q15 have been described. Oncogenic simian virus (SV40) may play a role in the onset or progression of pleomorphic adenoma.
4885,Who is at highest risk for Pleomorphic adenoma ?,"The risk factors for the development of Pleomorphic adenoma are as follows:
Prior head and neck irradiation is a risk factor for the development of Pleomorphic adenoma. Environmental factors Occupations associated with increased risk include: Rubber products manufacturing Asbestos mining Plumbing Some types of wood working Hair dressing"

4887,What to expect if I have Pleomorphic adenoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prognosis is generally excellent for most of the patients after surgical resection. Depending on the extent of the tumor at the time of diagnosis, the prognosis may vary sometimes. Recurrence can be a problem if the tumor arises from the parotid gland. 2-7% of cases can go into malignant transformation if left untreated."
4888,Who can contribute to the (project name) project?,"A quick statement about the intended specialty this applies to. Please indicate if this is an Assistant, Associate or Editor-in-Chief level project.
Example: ""This project is intended for editors at an Assistant Editor-in-Chief level or higher. This may be the right project for you if you are a (choose all that apply: college student, medical student, intern, resident, attending physician, hospitalist, specialist, medical faculty, researcher, nurse, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and allied health professional)."""
4889,Why redirect a page?,"Sometimes a topic will have multiple names or abbreviations, and you will want to direct them all to one page
For example take the page ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction. The names STEMI, MI, Acute MI, Myocardial Infarction, AMI all are redirected to the page ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction."
4890,How Do I Redirect To A Subheading of the Page Instead of the Page in General?,"Say you want to redirect the page ""Alcohol septal ablation"" to a section of the parent page entitled Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy interventional cardiology. You can redirect to a specific subheading within a page by putting the name of the page followed by the hatch mark of the subheading you want to direct to. The example for alcohol septal ablation is shown below:
If a spelling mistake occurs in a title such as STElevation Myocardial Infarction, it is not possible for a regular user to move the page with all its history. It is however possible to create a redirect. A new page ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction must be created first, and the contents from the old page must be copied manually. Then the old page STElevation Myocardial Infarction must be edited and its source code replaced by:
Don't make a redirect that points to another redirect. This is called a double redirect. These redirects don't work, and they can create a slow, unpleasant experience for the reader.

4895,What is an .SVG?,"A Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) is an vector image which is constructed through mathematical expressions rather than a bitmap of RBG colors corresponding to each pixel. Because vector images are mathematically defined, they retain their quality no matter the resolution of the monitor on which they are displayed. This means an.SVG image that is displayed at a size of 2 inches will have lines that are just as crisp as an image that is displayed at 4 inches in size. This makes.SVG images ideal for things like text that will be displayed at various sizes. However, because each element of a.SVG image is represented as a mathematical expression, these images are often larger in size than corresponding raster images."
4896,When Should I Use an .SVG Image?,"Vector images, such as an.SVG, are not always appropriate, especially for certain web applications. The following is a list of times when a.SVG may be more appropriate than a.JPG,.GIF, or.PNG:
High image quality is required for monitors in a large range of resoltion, such as both on an mobile device and a TV display The file size is not critical. E.g., for uses where the user is expected to have a strong internet connection. The image involves text and will be viewed on various types of displays The text within the image needs to be searchable"

4899,Where Do I Find Synonyms?,"Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
MedlinePlus
Google Search
Diseases Database
Whonamedit"
4900,Where Is The Content Located On The Page?,"Synonyms and keywords are listed at the top of the page, as seen here."
4901,What Is The Syntax Of The Content?,"Type {{SK}} into the edit box. On the page it will appear like this: Synonyms and keywords: List the synonyms. The general method of listing is to capitalize the first letter of the first synonym, and thereafter only capitalize letters of proper nouns. Separate each synonym with a semicolon and a space. Note the use of abbreviated terms, the plural version of the terms, and alternative order of the words in the term. If there is a British spelling or version of the word, this should also be included under synonyms and keywords. The list of synonyms and keywords appear as outlined below, and should be complete and exhaustive. A good example of a complete, exhaustive list of synonyms and keywords is for Premature Ventricular Complex:
Synonyms and keywords: Premature ventricular beat; premature ventricular beats; premature ventricular complex; premature ventricular complexes; premature ventricular contraction; premature ventricular contractions; PVB; PVBs; PVC; PVCs; VEA; VEB; VEBs; VES; ventricular ectopic activity; ventricular ectopic beat; ventricular ectopic beats; ventricular extrasystole; ventricular premature beat; ventricular premature beats; ventricular premature complex; ventricular premature complexes; ventricular premature contraction; ventricular premature contractions; VPB; VPBs; VPC; VPCs"
4902,What If Someone Searches For The Synonym?,"The synonyms should be created into redirects, so that anyone searching for the synonym will be automatically directed to the disease page you are creating.
First check that the synonyms do not already have pages that exist. If duplicate pages exist, they should all be redirected to a single page. This is to avoid duplicating content for the same disease.
Creating a redirect: For example, to create a redirect so that someone searching for the synonym Alport syndrome would be directed to the hereditary nephritis page, type Alport syndrome into the main search box on Wikidoc. If the page has not been created, it will say ""There were no results matching this query"". Click where it says ""create the page Alport syndrome on this Wiki!"", which will take you directly to the edit box. Type in the edit box #redirectHereditary nephritis Click the save button at the bottom of the edit box.
After you have created the redirect, test it out by searching for the redirect you created.
You can also create redirects for alternate spellings or errors that could be made when searching for a disease. For example, you could create redirects for ""Alport's syndrome"", ""Alpert syndrome"", or ""Alpert's syndrome"". For more help on how to create redirects, click here.
Template:WikiDoc Sources"
4903,What is a template?,"A template is a computer program that generates the same content on multiple pages. For example, the help menu that appears at the bottom of the page is a template that appears on all pages. If you edited a page, at the bottom of that page, you would see the code {{WH}}. This tells the software to insert the help menu at the bottom of the page."
4904,What is WikiDoc?,"WikiDoc (<wee-kee doc> or <wick-ey doc>): WikiDoc is an open source website that allows an international community of healthcare professionals to add and edit medical content in a process termed co-creation. WikiDoc is designed to facilitate collaborative authoring.
WikiDoc allows a community of healthcare professionals to'co-create' webpages in a way that does not require knowledge of HTML language or computer programming. As a result, numerous people can collaborate in writing articles, textbook chapters or news stories. Prior versions of webpages are stored, and at any time, a page can be reverted to any of its previous states. The'Discussion' tab allows the community of users to discuss rapidly evolving issues so that a consensus can be reached regarding WikiDoc content. WikiDoc members can choose to be alerted by email when changes are made to a topic they are interested in by clicking on the'Watch' tab."

I grew up as an only child in Oklahoma. One of the only books I had was a single volume of a blue encyclopedia from the 1920s that I bought at a garage sale when I was in second grade. I remember reading as much of that one volume of the encyclopedia as I could, over and over again. I kept it right next to my bed and was mesmerized by it. Eventually Safeway grocery stores gave kids volumes from the Golden Book Encyclopdia once your mom bought enough groceries. If just one young person is inspired by our blue medical textbook/encyclopedia like I was by an outdated encyclopedia, it will have been worth the effort.
Please read ""The World is Flat"" by Thomas L. Friedman. One of the premises of this book is that information technology has leveled the playing field of knowledge workers. Silos of knowledge are coming down. Knowledge workers are sharing information freely. Copyright is out, copyleft is in. Those communities that share knowledge most freely, grow and innovate most rapidly. Distributed learning and collaboration are the keys to success in the future. Knowledge workers are demanding free access to shared knowledge.
The ""world is flat"", but ""medicine is flat"" as well. It is in the spirit of fostering collaboration among health care providers in sharing medical knowledge that WikiDoc was created. WikiDoc is a global textbook or encyclopedia of medicine that anyone can add to and edit. It is also a source of healthcare news stories. Launched by C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. of Harvard Medical School in 2006, WikiDoc is the first and largest wiki dedicated to medicine on the internet with an initial focus on cardiovascular disease.
As a student I struggled to find information for rounds in the morning. As a former Chief Resident at the Brigham and Womens' Hospital, I remember struggling daily to find the latest information for morning report. As a fellow, finding materials for cardiac cath conference was always a challenge at the end of a long, busy day. Learning is a life long struggle and journey. As long as you are learning about a disease state, why not share what you have learned with others?
WikiDoc is intended to be a shared resource for housestaff (in preparation for morning report), medical students (in preparation for morning rounds) and fellows (in preparation for conferences). Nurses and attending physicians may find it valuable to share and improve upon their fund of general medical knowledge."

4908,How Do I Sign Up For News Services to be Emailed to Me Automatically?,In general most newspapers and journals will email you with daily or weekly updates.
4909,What are the symptoms of Bleeding?,"Blood coming from an open wound Bruising Shock, which may cause any of the following symptoms: Confusion or decreasing alertness Clammy skin Dizziness or light-headedness after an injury Low blood pressure Paleness (pallor) Rapid pulse, increased heart rate Shortness of breath Weakness
Symptoms of internal bleeding may also include:
Abdominal pain and swelling Chest pain External bleeding through a natural opening Blood in the stool (appears black, maroon, or bright red) Blood in the urine (appears red, pink, or tea-colored) Blood in the vomit (looks bright red, or brown like coffee-grounds) Vaginal bleeding (heavier than usual or after menopause)
Skin color changes that occur several days after an injury (skin may black, blue, purple, yellowish green)"
4910,What causes Bleeding?,Bleeding can be caused by injuries or can occur spontaneously. Spontaneous bleeding is most commonly caused by problems with the joints or the gastrointestinal or urogenital tracts.
4911,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bleeding ?,"Seek medical help if:
Bleeding can't be controlled, required the use of a tourniquet, or was caused by a serious injury The wound might need stitches Gravel or dirt cannot be removed easily with gentle cleaning You think there may be internal bleeding or shock Signs of infection develop, including increased pain, redness, swelling, yellow or brown fluid, swollen lymph nodes, fever, or red streaks spreading from the site toward the heart The injury was due to an animal or human bite The patient has not had a tetanus shot in the last 5-10 years"
4912,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cancer ?,Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms of cancer.
4913,What to expect if I have Cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on the type of cancer and the stage of the cancer when diagnosed.
Some cancers can be cured. Other cancers that are not curable can still be treated effectively. Some patients can live for many years with cancer. Other tumors are quickly life threatening."
4914,How a differential blood count performed?,"The health care provider will take blood from your vein. The blood collects into an airtight container.
In infants or a young child, blood will be taken from a heel stick or finger stick. The blood is collected in a small glass tube or onto a slide or test strip.
Cotton or a bandage may be applied to stop any bleeding.
A laboratory specialist takes a drop of blood from your sample and smears it onto a glass slide. The smear is stained with a special dye, which helps tell the difference between various types of white blood cells.
Five types of white blood cells, also called leukocytes, normally appear in the blood:
Neutrophils Lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) Monocytes Eosinophils Basophils
A computer or the health care provider counts the number of each type of cell. The test shows if the number of cells are in proper proportion with one another, and if there is more or less of one cell type."
4915,How to prepare for a differential blood count?,No special preparation is necessary.
4916,How will a differential blood count feel?,"When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing."
4917,Why is a differential blood count performed?,"This test is done to diagnose an infection, anemia, and leukemia. It may also be used to see if treatment for any of these conditions is working."
4918,What are normal results?,Neutrophils: 40% to 60% Lymphocytes: 20% to 40% Monocytes: 2% to 8% Eosinophils: 1% to 4% Basophils: 0.5% to 1% Band (young neutrophil): 0% to 3%
4919,What do abnormal results mean?,"Any infection or acute stress increases your number of white blood cells. High white blood cell counts may be due to inflammation, an immune response, or blood diseases such as leukemia.
It is important to realize that an abnormal increase in one type of white blood cell can cause a decrease in the percentage of other types of white blood cells.
An increased percentage of neutrophils may be due to:
Acute infection Acute stress Eclampsia Gout Myelocytic leukemia Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatic fever Thyroiditis Trauma
A decreased percentage of neutrophils may be due to:
Aplastic anemia Chemotherapy Influenza or other viral infection Widespread bacterial infection Radiation therapy or exposure
An increased percentage of lymphocytes may be due to:
Chronic bacterial infection Infectious hepatitis Infectious mononucleosis Lymphocytic leukemia Multiple myeloma Viral infection (such as infectious mononucleosis, mumps, measles)
A decreased percentage of lymphocytes may be due to:
Chemotherapy HIV infection Leukemia Radiation therapy or exposure Sepsis
An increased percentage of monocytes may be due to:
Chronic inflammatory disease Parasitic infection Tuberculosis Viral infection (for example, infectious mononucleosis, mumps, measles)
An increased percentage of eosinophils may be due to:
Allergic reaction Cancer Collagen vascular disease Parasitic infection
A decreased percentage of basophils may be due to:
Acute allergic reaction"
4920,What are the risks?,"There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:
Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling light-headed Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)"
4921,What are the symptoms of leukemia?,"Like all blood cells, leukemia cells travel through the body. The symptoms of leukemia depend on the number of leukemia cells and where these cells collect in the body.
People with chronic leukemia may not have symptoms. The doctor may find the disease during a routine blood test.
People with acute leukemia usually go to their doctor because they feel sick. If the brain is affected, they may have headaches, vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, or seizures. Leukemia also can affect other parts of the body such as the digestive tract, kidneys, lungs, heart, or testes.
Common symptoms of chronic or acute leukemia may include:
Swollen lymph nodes that usually don't hurt (especially lymph nodes in the neck or armpit) Fever or night sweat Frequent infections Feeling weak or tired Bleeding and bruising easily (bleeding gums, purplish patches in the skin, or tiny red spots under the skin) Swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from a swollen spleen or liver) Weight loss for no known reason Pain in the bones or joints"
4922,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Leukemia ?,"If you have leukemia, and have received chemotherapy, you may develop a fever that may reflect the fact that your blood counts are low, and you should seek medical care for antibiotics."
4923,Where to get Medical Care for leukemia?,Directions to Hospitals Treating Leukemia
4924,What to expect if I have Leukemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Leukemia is a very serious disease that can result in many complications. Complications can come from the disease itself and the treatments. Acute leukemia has a much quicker and more dramatic onset but can occasionally be cured. Chronic Leukemia has a slower onset and can often be put off for years; however, chronic leukemia is very rarely cured."
4925,What are the symptoms of Multiple myeloma?,"Early multiple myeloma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Bone pain Broken bones Numbness and/or muscle weakness Confusion Dizziness Edema in legs
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4926,Who is at highest risk for Multiple myeloma ?,"While the exact cause of multiple myeloma is not known, clinical data has suggested that the development of multiple myeloma is related to several factors.
Age: Age is the biggest risk factor for multiple myeloma. Most cases are found in people older than 65. Plasma cell diseases: Studies show patients with other plasma cell diseases will develop multiple myeloma later. Radiation exposure: Cases reports demonstrate exposure to radiation may increase the risk of multiple myeloma. Exposure on oil-related industries: Some studies suggest that workers in some oil-related industries may be at a higher risk. Family history: Some data suggest multiple myeloma seems to run in some families. But most patients have no other relatives with the disease. Life-style: A study by the American Cancer Society found that being overweight increases a person's risk of developing multiple myeloma. Race: Epidemiological data show multiple myeloma is almost twice as common among black Americans as white Americans. Gender: Men are slightly more likely to get multiple myeloma than women."
4927,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Multiple myeloma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of multiple myeloma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Broken bones Numbness Muscle weakness Confusion Severe thirsty, oliguria and/or edema"
4928,What to expect if I have Multiple myeloma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Multiple myeloma is hard to cure. The prognosis depends on the following:
Cytogenetic analysis of myeloma cells The stage of the cancer The patient's general health"
4929,What are the symptoms of Polycythemia vera?,"Symptoms may include any of the following:
Trouble breathing when lying down Dizziness Excess bleeding Full feeling in the left upper abdomen (due to enlarged spleen) Headache Itchiness, especially after a warm bath Red skin coloring, especially of the face Shortness of breath Symptoms of blood clots in veins near the skin surface (phlebitis)
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Bluish skin color Fatigue Red skin spots Vision problems"
4930,What causes Polycythemia vera?,"Polycythemia vera is a disorder of the bone marrow. It mainly causes too many red blood cells to be produced. The numbers of white blood cells and platelets may also be higher than normal.
This is a rare disorder that occurs more often in men than in women. It is not usually seen in people under age 40. The problem is often linked to a gene defect called JAK2V617F. The cause of this gene defect is unknown."
4931,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Polycythemia vera ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of polycythemia vera develop.
4932,What to expect if I have Polycythemia vera  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The disease usually develops slowly. Most people do not have symptoms related to the disease at the time of diagnosis. The condition is often diagnosed before severe symptoms occur.
4933,What are the symptoms of Primary central nervous system lymphoma?,"Early brain tumor does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Epileptic seizures Decreased sensation of a body area Dysfunctional movement or uncontrollable movement Speech difficulties Double vision or decreased vision Hearing loss Personality and behavior changes Emotional instability Hiccups
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4934,What causes Primary central nervous system lymphoma?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of brain tumor is related to several factors.
Radiation exposure Family history Immune system disorders Cell phone use: There has been a great deal of debate in recent years."
4935,Who is at highest risk for Primary central nervous system lymphoma ?,"Clinical data has suggested that the development of brain tumor is related to several factors.
Radiation exposure Family history Immune system disorders Cell phone use: There has been a great deal of debate in recent years."
4936,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Primary central nervous system lymphoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of brain tumor develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
New, or suddenly develop stupor New, or suddenly develop vision changes New, or suddenly develop speech changes Consciousness disorders"
4937,What to expect if I have Primary central nervous system lymphoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of brain tumor depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The location of the tumor The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the brain Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred The patient’s general health"
4938,What are the symptoms of Thymoma?,"Early thymoma does not have any symptoms. As the tumor grows larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Chest pain Cough that does not go away Trouble breathing Hemoptysis Hoarseness
Other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
4939,Who is at highest risk for Thymoma ?,Not much is known about why thymoma develop in some people but not in others.
4940,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Thymoma ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of thymoma develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Severe shortness of breath A large amount of hemoptysis"
4941,What to expect if I have Thymoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of thymoma depends on the following:
The location of the tumor The stage of the tumor Whether the tumor can be removed completely by surgery The patient's general health Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
4942,What are the symptoms of Cryoglobulinemia?,"Symptoms vary depending on the type of cryoglobulinemia and the organs that are affected. In general, symptoms may include:
Difficulty breathing Fatigue Glomerulonephritis Joint pain Muscle pain Purpura Raynaud's phenomenon Skin death Skin ulceration"
4943,What causes Cryoglobulinemia?,"Cryoglobulins are antibodies. It is not yet known why they become solid at low temperatures. When they do thicken or become somewhat gel-like, they can block blood vessels throughout the body. This may lead to complications ranging from skin rashes to kidney failure.
Cryoglobulinemia is part of a group of diseases that cause vasculitis -- damage and inflammation of the blood vessels throughout the body. The disorder is grouped into three main types, depending on the type of antibody that is produced:
Cryoglobulinemia type I Cryoglobulinemia typeII Cryoglobulinemia type III
Types II and III are also referred to as mixed cryoglobulinemia."
4944,Who is at highest risk for Cryoglobulinemia ?,"Type I cryoglobulinemia is most often related to cancer of the blood or immune systems.
Types II and III are most often found in people who have a chronic (long-lasting) inflammatory condition, such as an autoimmune disease or hepatitis C. Most patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia have a chronic hepatitis C infection.
Other conditions that may be related to cryoglobulinemia include:
Leukemia Multiple myeloma Mycoplasma pneumonia Primary macroglobulinemia Rheumatoid arthritis Systemic lupus erythematosus"
4945,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cryoglobulinemia ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop symptoms of cryoglobulinemia You have hepatitis C and develop symptoms of cryoglobulinemia You have cryoglobulinemia and develop new or worsening symptoms"
4946,What to expect if I have Cryoglobulinemia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cryoglobulinemia is not usually deadly. However, if the kidneys are affected, the outlook is poor."
4947,How is the Coombs test done?,"Blood is typically drawn from a vein, usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.
Next, the health care provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.
In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding."
4948,Who needs Coombs test?,"There are two forms of the Coombs' test: direct and indirect.
The direct Coombs' test is used to detect antibodies that are already bound to the surface of red blood cells. Many diseases and drugs (quinidine, methyldopa, and procainamide) can lead to production of these antibodies. These antibodies sometimes destroy red blood cells and cause anemia. This test is sometimes performed to diagnose the cause of anemia or jaundice.
The indirect Coombs' test looks for unbound circulating antibodies against a series of standardized red blood cells. The indirect Coombs' test is only rarely used to diagnose a medical condition. More often, it is used to determine whether a person might have a reaction to a blood transfusion."
4949,Where to find centers that perform Coombs test?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Coombs test
4950,What to expect if I have Coombs test  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Normal Results No clumping of cells (agglutination), indicating that there are no antibodies to red blood cells, is normal.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal (positive) direct Coombs' test means you have antibodies that act against your red blood cells. This may be due to:
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia without another cause. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other lymphoproliferative disorder. Drug-induced hemolytic anemia (many drugs have been associated with this complication). Erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn). Infectious mononucleosis. Mycoplasmal infection. Syphilis. Systemic lupus erythematosus or another rheumatologic condition. Transfusion reaction, such as one due to improperly matched units of blood.
The test is also abnormal in some people without any clear cause, especially among the elderly. Up to 3% of people who are in the hospital without a known blood disorder will have an abnormal direct Coombs' test.
An abnormal (positive) indirect Coombs' test means you have antibodies that will act against red blood cells your body views as foreign. This may suggest:
Autoimmune or drug-induced hemolytic anemia. Erythroblastosis fetalis hemolytic disease. Incompatible blood match (when used in blood banks)."
4951,How is the ELISA done?,"Blood is typically drawn from a vein, usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.
Next, the health care provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.
Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.
In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.
The sample is sent to a laboratory where the targeted antibody (or antigen) is linked to an enzyme. If the target substance is in the sample, the test solution turns a different color. When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing."
4952,Who needs ELISA?,This test is often used to see if you have been exposed to viruses or other substances that cause infection. It is often used to screen for current or past infections.
4953,Where to find centers that perform ELISA?,Directions to Hospitals Performing ELISA
4954,What to expect if I have ELISA  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Normal Results Normal values depend on the type of substance being identified. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results
Abnormal Results Abnormal values depend on the type of substance being identified. In some people, a positive result may be normal."
4955,What are the symptoms of Lupus nephritis?,"Some patients may show no signs and symptoms of lupus nephritis. Usual symptoms include:
Blood in the urine Foamy appearance to urine Hypertension Swelling of any area of the body, especially around the eyes. Weight gain
Diseases with similar symptoms are
Chronic glomerulonephritis Polyarteritis nodosa Wegener granulomatosis"
4956,What causes Lupus nephritis?,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is an autoimmune disease. This means there is a problem with the body's immune system.
Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from harmful substances. But in patients with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissue.
SLE may damage different parts of the kidney, leading to interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous GN. It may rapidly worsen to kidney failure.
Lupus nephritis affects approximately 3 out of every 10,000 people. In children with SLE, about half will have some form or degree of kidney involvement.
More than half of patients have not had other symptoms of SLE when they are diagnosed with lupus nephritis.
SLE is most common in women ages 20 - 40."
4957,Who is at highest risk for Lupus nephritis ?,The underlying cause of this autoimmune disease is not clear.
4958,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Lupus nephritis ?,"Call your doctor if your symptoms of lupus nephritis develop. If you experience the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
Urine output decreases even anuria."
4959,What to expect if I have Lupus nephritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies, depending on:
The class of lupus nephritis: Focal lupus nephritis, minimal mesangial lupus nephritis and mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis have better prognosis than other classes. And, advanced sclerosis lupus nephritis carries a poor prognosis. Nephrotic syndrome carries worse prognosis. Creatinine level: Patients with elevated creatinine (>3 mg/dL) at presentation have worse outcomes. Patients with persistently elevated anti-dsDNA and low C3 and C4 levels have poorer outcomes. Renal biopsy findings showing diffuse lupus nephritis or high chronicity index suggest worse prognosis. Age onset of lupus nephritis: Young age onset carries worse prognosis. Male gender have poorer outcomes than female. Black race have worse outcomes than other races."
4960,What are the symptoms of Serum sickness?,"Fever. General ill feeling. Hives. Itching. Joint pain. Rash. Swollen lymph nodes.
Note: Symptoms usually do not develop until 7 - 21 days after the first dose of antiserum or exposure to the medication. However, some people may develop symptoms in 1 - 3 days if they have previously been exposed to the substance."
4961,What causes Serum sickness?,"Plasma is the clear fluid portion of blood. It does not contain blood cells, but it does contain many proteins, including antibodies, which are formed as part of the immune response to protect against infection.
Antiserum is produced from the plasma of a person or animal that has immunity against a particular infection or poisonous substance. Antiserum may be used to protect a person who has been exposed to a potentially dangerous microorganism against which the person has not been immunized. For example, you may receive a certain type of antiserum injection if you have been exposed to tetanus or rabies. This is called passive immunization. It gives you immediate, but temporary, protection while your body develops an active immune response against the toxin or microorganism.
During serum sickness, the immune system falsely identifies a protein in antiserum as a potentially harmful substance (antigen). The result is a faulty immune system response that attacks the antiserum. Immune system elements and the antiserum combine to form immune complexes, which cause inflammation and other symptoms.
Certain medications (such as penicillin, cefaclor, and sulfa) can cause a similar reaction. Unlike other drug allergies, which occur very soon after receiving the medication again, serum sickness develops 7 - 21 days after the first exposure to a medication.
Injected proteins such as antithymocyte globulin (used to treat organ transplant rejection) and rituximab (used to treat immune disorders and cancers) cause serum sickness reactions.
Blood products may also cause serum sickness."
4962,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Serum sickness ?,Call your health care provider if medication or antiserum has been given within the last 4 weeks and symptoms of serum sickness appear.
4963,What to expect if I have Serum sickness  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The symptoms usually go away within a few days.
4964,What are the symptoms of Pyelonephritis?,"Symptoms of pyelonephritis can vary depending on a person’s age and may include the following: Fever Vomiting Back, side, and groin pain Chills Nausea Frequent, painful urination Children younger than 2 years old may only have a high fever without symptoms related to the urinary tract. Older people may not have any symptoms related to the urinary tract either; instead, they may exhibit confusion, disordered speech, or hallucinations."
4965,What causes Pyelonephritis ?,"Pyelonephritis is caused by a bacterium or virus infecting the kidneys. Though many bacteria and viruses can cause pyelonephritis, the bacterium Escherichia coli is often the cause. Bacteria and viruses can move to the kidneys from the bladder or can be carried through the bloodstream from other parts of the body. A UTI in the bladder that does not move to the kidneys is called cystitis."
4966,Who is at highest risk for Pyelonephritis ?,"People most at risk for pyelonephritis are those who have a bladder infection and those with a structural, or anatomic, problem in the urinary tract. Urine normally flows only in one direction—from the kidneys to the bladder. However, the flow of urine may be blocked in people with a structural defect of the urinary tract, a kidney stone, or an enlarged prostate—the walnut-shaped gland in men that surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder and supplies fluid that goes into semen. Urine can also back up, or reflux, into one or both kidneys. This problem, which is called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), happens when the valve mechanism that normally prevents backward flow of urine is not working properly. VUR is most commonly diagnosed during childhood. Pregnant women and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system are also at increased risk of pyelonephritis."
4967,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pyelonephritis ?,"Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call right away if the following symptoms develop:
Back or side pain Chills Fever Vomiting
These may be signs of a possible kidney infection.
Also call if you have already been diagnosed with a UTI and the symptoms come back shortly after treatment with antibiotics."
4968,What to expect if I have Pyelonephritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A urinary tract infection is uncomfortable, but treatment is usually successful. If you have a kidney infection, it may take 1 week or longer for your symptoms to go away."
4969,What are the symptoms of urethritis?,"The symptoms vary among the different types of urethritis and may include-
Discharge from the penis or vagina Burning while urinating Itching and redness in the genital area Anal itching"
4970,What causes Sexually transmitted disease?,"Both bacteria and viruses may cause urethritis. The same bacteria that cause this condition are E. coli, chlamydia, gonorrhea. These bacteria also cause urinary tract infections and some sexually transmitted diseases. Viral causes are herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus.
Other causes include:
Injury Sensitivity to the chemicals used in spermicides or contraceptive jellies, or foams Sometimes the cause is unknown."
4971,Who is at highest risk for Urethritis ?,"Risks for urethritis include:
Being a female Being male, ages 20 to 35 Having many sexual partners High-risk sexual behavior (such as anal sex without a condom) History of sexually transmitted diseases"
4972,What to expect if I have Urethritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With the correct diagnosis and treatment, urethritis most often clears up without further problems.
However, urethritis can lead to long-term damage to the urethra and scar tissue called urethral stricture. It can also cause damage to other urinary organs in both men and women. In women, the infection could lead to fertility problems if it spreads to the pelvis."
4973,What are the symptoms of Acute renal failure?,"Bloody stools Breath odor Bruising easily Changes in mental status or mood Decreased appetite Decreased sensation, especially in the hands or feet Fatigue Flank pain (between the ribs and hips) Hand tremor High blood pressure Metallic taste in mouth Nausea or vomiting, may last for days Nosebleeds Persistent hiccups Prolonged bleeding Seizures Slow, sluggish movements Swelling - generalized (fluid retention) Swelling of the ankle, foot, and leg Urination changes:
Decrease in amount of urine Excessive urination at night Urination stops completely"
4974,What causes Acute renal failure?,"There are many possible causes of kidney damage. They include:
Acute tubular necrosis Autoimmune kidney disease Acute nephritic syndrome Interstitial nephritis
Decreased blood flow due to very low blood pressure, which can result from:
Burns Dehydration Hemorrhage Injury Septic shock Serious illness Surgery
Disorders that cause clotting within the kidney's blood vessels:
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome Idiopathic thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura (ITTP) Malignant hypertension Transfusion reaction Scleroderma
Infections that directly injure the kidney, such as:
Acute pyelonephritis Septicemia
Pregnancy complications, including:
Placenta abruptio Placenta previa Urinary tract obstruction"
4975,Who is at highest risk for Acute renal failure ?,"Factors that may increase your risk of Kidney failure include:
Diabetes High blood pressure. Heart disease Smoking Obesity High cholesterol African-American, American Indian or Asian-American race A family history of kidney disease Age 65 or older"
4976,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute renal failure ?,Call your health care provider if your urine output slows or stops or you have other symptoms of acute kidney failure.
4977,What to expect if I have Acute renal failure  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Acute kidney failure is potentially life-threatening and may require intensive treatment. However, the kidneys usually start working again within several weeks to months after the underlying cause has been treated.
In some cases, chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease may develop. Death is most common when kidney failure is caused by surgery, trauma, or severe infection in someone with heart disease, lung disease, or recent stroke. Old age, infection, loss of blood from the intestinal tract, and progression of kidney failure also increase the risk of death."

4979,What causes Brain stem death?,Severe brain swelling after a serious fall or traffic accident or trauma Massive cerebral hemorrhage Severe or long time of anoxia
4980,What are the symptoms of Coma?,"Coma is not a disease but a condition, which can be caused by many disorders.
Onset time: When a patient suffers a hemorrhage stroke or severe head trauma, coma may start suddenly. While for a person with alcohol abuse or some kind of drugs, the progress of unconsciousness may be slowly. Antecedent symptoms before coma, depending on the underlying disease: If the coma is caused by alcohol abuse or some kind of drugs, patients may experienced mildly confusion, drowsy or personality change in the beginning. If the underlying cause is a brain infection, patients may show signs including headache, fever, or dizziness before the actual coma develops. In some cases, coma may happen so quickly that patients or their families don't have time to notice. Signs of coma
Loss of consciousness Some spontaneously movements, including shaking, tremors, and jerking movements. Eyes' abnormal movement If the breathing muscles are affected, the patient may show irregular breathing. No response to external stimuli
Diseases with similar symptoms are:
Syncope Epilepsy Dizziness Hysteria"
4981,Who is at highest risk for Coma ?,"A hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke A severe head injury Seizures Brain tumor Brain infections Hypoxia for a long time Metabolic abnormalities, such as diabetic hyperosmolar coma, hypoglycemia Toxins, including poisons, alcohol and other drugs (barbiturates, sedatives, amphetamines, cocaine) Liver failure or kidney failure"
4982,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Coma ?,"When you find someone in coma, call 911 as soon as possible."
4983,What to expect if I have Coma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Some patients with coma can recover, while others may keep in a vegetative state. The prognosis depends on:
The underlying causes The severity The site of neurological damage"
4984,What are the symptoms of Foodborne illness?,"Symptoms range from mild to serious. They include:
Abdominal cramps Dehydration Diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Upset stomach"
4985,What causes Foodborne illness?,"Harmful bacteria are the most common cause of foodborne illness. Foods may have some bacteria on them when you buy them. Raw meat may become contaminated during slaughter. Fruits and vegetables may become contaminated when they are growing or when they are processed, but it can also happen in your kitchen if you leave food out for more than 2 hours at room temperature."
4986,What are the symptoms of gangrene?,Symptoms differ according to the type of gangrene present. Table 1 summarizes the symptoms observed in each type of gangrene.
4987,What causes gangrene?,Wound constriction that is followed by hemorrhage. Body part compression. Necrosis due to bandages.
4988,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gangrene ?,"If numbness is felt on the fingers or toes, a visit to the doctor should be done right away. Non- healing wounds or any skin changes on the foot in a patient with diabetes should be evaluated as soon as possible. After surgery, if the patient experiences worsening pain or skin color changes on the affected area, or if the patient starts to feel sick, an urgent visit to the doctor is needed."
4989,What to expect if I have Gangrene  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis will depend on the severity of the gangrene. In some cases, survival is still noted even if a certain body part has fallen off."
4990,What are the symptoms of Hyperchloremia?,"Often, hyperchloremia does not produce symptoms. Symptoms may include:
Excessive fluid loss (Diarrhea, Vomiting) Dyspnea (shortness of breath) Intense thirst Weakness Tachypnea (rapid breathing) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Pitting Edema (abnormal amount of fluid under the skin, causing swelling) Lowered cognitive ability Kussmaul's breathing (very deep and labored breathing at a normal or reduced rate) Coma
If the sufferer is a diabetic, hyperchloremia can cause high levels of blood sugar."
4991,What causes Hyperchloremia?,"Hyperchloremia is caused by:
Low Anion Gap (when the difference in positive and negative ions in the serum is low) Metabolic and Endocrine Diabetic coma Diabetes insipidus Hyperparathyroidism Metabolic Acidosis Type I and II Renal Tubular Acidosis Hypernatremia Gastorintestinal Dehydration Ileal conduits Kidney diseases Loss of pancreatic secretion Prolonged Diarrhea Ureteral colonic anastomosis Vomiting Brain stem injury causing neurogenic hyperventilation Medications Androgens Corticosteroids Diuretics Estrogens"
4992,Who is at highest risk for Hyperchloremia ?,People who are at risk are patients who have diabetes or kidney diseases.
4993,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperchloremia ?,"Consult a doctor immediately if you have any of these:
Drowsiness or confusion Extreme nausea that interferes with eating and not relieved by medicines Having diarrhea 4 to 6 times in a day that is not relieved by diet modification or anti-diarrhea drugs Irritability and muscle twitching Poor appetite and increased urination Severe constipation for 2 to 3 days, and not relieved by laxatives Vomiting more than 4 to 5 times in a day"
4994,What to expect if I have Hyperchloremia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When going to the doctor you will be asked some of these question and be administered a blood test to check for abnormalities, the questions might be:
How long have you had the symptoms? Do you have a history with diabetes, kidney disease or heart diseases? What medicines are you currently taking (including over-the-counter, vitamins or herbal remedies)?"
4995,What are the symptoms of Hyponatremia?,"Common symptoms include:
Abnormal mental status Confusion Decreased consciousness Hallucinations Possible coma Convulsions Fatigue Headache Irritability Loss of appetite Muscle spasms or cramps Muscle weakness Nausea Restlessness Vomiting"
4996,What causes Hyponatremia?,"Sodium is found mostly in the body fluids outside the cells. It is very important for maintaining blood pressure. Sodium is also needed for nerves and muscles to work properly.
When the amount of sodium in fluids outside cells drops, water moves into the cells to balance the levels. This causes the cells to swell with too much water. Although most cells can handle this swelling, brain cells cannot, because the skull bones confine them. Brain swelling causes most of the symptoms of hyponatremia.
In hyponatremia, the imbalance of water to salt is caused by one of three conditions:
Euvolemic hyponatremia -- total body water increases, but the body's sodium content stays the same Hypervolemic hyponatremia -- both sodium and water content in the body increase, but the water gain is greater Hypovolemic hyponatremia -- water and sodium are both lost from the body, but the sodium loss is greater
Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in the United States.
Causes of hyponatremia include:
Burns Congestive heart failure  Diarrhea Diuretic medications, which increase urine output Kidney diseases Liver cirrhosis Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Sweating Vomiting Anti-epileptic drugs -Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the most common AEDs which induce hyponatremia  Recently, other AEDs, such as eslicarbazepine ,valproic acid  have been found to cause hyponatremia."
4997,Who is at highest risk for Hyponatremia ?,"Although hyponatremia can develop in a variety of disease conditions or due to iatrogenic causes, certain patient cohorts like those with acute or chronic renal failure (inability to excrete water), congestive heart failure, cirrhosis (ADH release due to low effective circulatory volume) are very prone to develop hyponatremia. More recently, hyponatremia has seen to be occuring in nearly a third of coronavirus disease patients."
4998,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyponatremia ?,Hyponatremia can be a life-threatening emergency. Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of this condition.
4999,What to expect if I have Hyponatremia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on the condition that is causing the problem. In general, acute hyponatremia, which occurs in less than 48 hours, is more dangerous than hyponatremia that develops slowly over time. When sodium levels fall slowly over a period of days or weeks (chronic hyponatremia), the brain cells have time to adjust and swelling is minimal. In COVID 19 patients, hyponatremia was associated with increased risk of encephalopathy and mechanical ventilation."
5000,What are the symptoms of Hypothermia?,"As people develop hypothermia, their abilities to think and move are often lost slowly. In fact, they may even be unaware that they need emergency treatment. Someone with hypothermia also is likely to have frostbite.
The symptoms include:
Drowsiness Weakness and loss of coordination Pale and cold skin Confusion Uncontrollable shivering (although at extremely low body temperatures, shivering may stop) Slowed breathing or heart rate Lethargy, cardiac arrest, shock, and coma can set in without prompt treatment. Hypothermia can be fatal."
5001,What causes Hypothermia?,"Hypothermia occurs when more heat is lost than the body can generate. It is usually caused by extended exposure to the cold.
Common causes include:
Being outside without enough protective clothing in winter Falling overboard from a boat into cold water Wearing wet clothing in windy or cold weather Heavy exertion, not drinking enough fluids, or not eating enough in cold weather"
5002,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hypothermia ?,Call 911 anytime you suspect someone has hypothermia. Give first aid while awaiting emergency assistance.
5003,What are the symptoms of Lactic acidosis?,Nausea Weakness
5004,What causes Lactic acidosis?,"The most common cause of lactic acidosis is intense exercise. However, it can also be caused by certain diseases, such as:
AIDS Cancer Kidney failure Respiratory failure Sepsis
A common medicine used to treat diabetes called metformin can also cause lactic acidosis. If you take this medicine, have your electrolyte levels checked 1 - 2 weeks after starting it."
5005,What are the symptoms of Metabolic acidosis?,"Most symptoms are caused by the underlying disease or condition that is causing the metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis itself usually causes rapid breathing. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, chronic (ongoing) condition."
5006,What causes Metabolic acidosis?,"Metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. There are several types of metablic acidosis:
Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances known as ketone bodies, which are acidic, build up during uncontrolled diabetes Hyperchloremic acidosis results from excessive loss of sodium bicarbonate from the body, as can happen with severe diarrhea Lactic acidosis is a buildup of lactic acid. It can be caused by: Alcohol Cancer Exercising for a very long time Liver failure Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Medications such as salicylates Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemia Seizures
Other causes of metabolic acidosis include:
Kidney disease (distal tubular acidosis and proximal renal tubular acidosis) Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol Severe dehydration"
5007,Who is at highest risk for Metabolic acidosis ?,Patient suffering from any of the conditions mentioned above are at risk of metabolic acidosis.
5008,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Metabolic acidosis ?,Seek medical treatment if you develop symptoms of any disease that can cause metabolic acidosis.
5009,What to expect if I have Metabolic acidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,What can be expected will depend on the underlying disease causing the metabolic acidosis.
5010,What are the symptoms of Near drowning?,"Symptoms can vary, but may include:
Abdominal distention Bluish skin of the face, especially around the lips Chest pain Cold skin and pale appearance Confusion Cough with pink, frothy sputum Irritability Lethargy No breathing Restlessness Shallow or gasping respirations Unconsciousness Vomiting"
5011,What causes Near drowning ?,Attempted suicide Blows to the head or seizures while in the water Drinking alcohol while boating or swimming Falling through thin ice Inability to swim or panicking while swimming Leaving small children unattended around bathtubs and pools
5012,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Near drowning ?,"If you cannot rescue the drowning person without endangering yourself, call for emergency medical assistance immediately. If you are trained and able to rescue the person, do so and then call for medical help.
All near-drowning patients should be checked by a doctor. Even though the person may revive quickly at the scene, lung complications are common. Fluid and body chemical (electrolyte) imbalances may develop, and other traumatic injuries may be present."
5013,What are the symptoms of Renal tubular acidosis?,"Most symptoms are caused by the underlying disease or condition that is causing the renal tubular acidosis or inherited disorder of kidneys. Renal tubular acidosis itself usually causes rapid breathing. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, acidosis can be a mild, chronic (ongoing) condition."
5014,What causes Renal tubular acidosis?,"Renal tubular acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body.
Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances known as ketone bodies, which are acidic, build up during uncontrolled diabetes Hyperchloremic acidosis results from excessive loss of sodium bicarbonate from the body, as can happen with severe diarrhea Lactic acidosis is a buildup of lactic acid. It can be caused by: Alcohol Cancer Exercising for a very long time Liver failure Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Medications such as salicylates Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemia Seizures

5017,What to expect if I have Renal tubular acidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,What can be expected will depend on the underlying disease causing the renal tubular acidosis.
5018,What are the symptoms of Respiratory acidosis?,"Symptoms may include:
Confusion Easy fatigue Lethargy Shortness of breath Sleepiness"
5019,What causes Respiratory acidosis?,"Causes of respiratory acidosis include:
Airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease, which reduce sending air into and out of the lungs lung tissue diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis Diseases of the chest such as scoliosis, which make the lungs less efficient at filling and emptying Diseases involving the nerves and muscles that cause the lungs to fill or empty Medications that suppress breathing including pain drugs, such as narcotics and sedatives such as benzodiazepines), especially concomitant use with alcohol Severe obesity, which limits lungs expansion
Chronic respiratory acidosis occurs over a long duration. This is a mild stable situation because the kidneys have had enough time to compensate and restore the body's acid-base balance by rising body chemicals, such as bicarbonate.
Acute respiratory acidosis is a severe situation in which carbon dioxide levels increase very quickly and before the kidneys can restore the body to a proper acid-base balance."
5020,Who is at highest risk for Respiratory acidosis ?,Patients who are suffering from any condition listed above have the highest risk of developing respiratory acidosis.
5021,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Respiratory acidosis ?,"Severe respiratory acidosis is a medical emergency. Seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of this condition.
Call your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of lung disease."
5022,What to expect if I have Respiratory acidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,How well you do depends on the disease causing the respiratory acidosis.
5023,What causes Respiratory failure?,"Diseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. Examples include
Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and cystic fibrosis Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy and stroke Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage. Drug or alcohol overdose Injuries from inhaling smoke or harmful fumes"
5024,What are the symptoms of Rhabdomyolysis?,"Abnormal urine color (dark, red, or cola colored) General weakness Muscle stiffness or aching (myalgia) Muscle tenderness Weakness of the affected muscles
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease include the following:
Fatigue Joint pain Seizures Weight gain (unintentional)"
5025,What causes Rhabdomyolysis?,"When muscle is damaged, a protein pigment called myoglobin is released into the bloodstream and filtered out of the body by the kidneys. Myoglobin breaks down into potentially harmful compounds. It may block the structures of the kidney, causing damage such as rhabdomyolysis or kidney failure.
Dead muscle tissue may cause a large amount of fluid to move from the blood into the muscle, reducing the fluid volume of the body and leading to shock and reduced blood flow to the kidneys.
The disorder may be caused by any condition that results in damage to skeletal muscle, especially trauma."
5026,Who is at highest risk for Rhabdomyolysis ?,"Alcoholism (with subsequent muscle tremors) Certain inherited or genetic syndromes Crush Injuries Heat intolerance Heatstroke Ischemia or necrosis of the muscles (as may occur with arterial occlusion, deep venous thrombosis, or other conditions) Low phosphate levels Seizures Severe exertion such as marathon running or calisthenics Shaking chills Trauma Use or overdose of drugs, especially cocaine, amphetamines, statins, heroin, or PCP"
5027,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Rhabdomyolysis ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms indicate rhabdomyolysis may be present.
5028,What to expect if I have Rhabdomyolysis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies depending on the extent of kidney damage. Acute kidney failure occurs in many patients. Treatment soon after rhabdomyolysis begins will reduce the risk of chronic kidney damage.
People with milder cases may return to normal activity within a few weeks to a month or more. However, some continue to have problems with fatigue and muscle pain."
5029,What are the symptoms of Snakebites?,"Symptoms depend on the type of snake, but may include:
Bleeding from wound Blurred vision Burning of the skin Convulsions Diarrhea Dizziness Excessive sweating Fainting Fang marks in the skin Fever Increased thirst Loss of muscle coordination Nausea and vomiting Numbness and tingling Rapid pulse Tissue death Severe pain Skin discoloration Swelling at the site of the bite Weakness
Rattlesnake bites are painful when they occur. Symptoms usually begin right away and may include:
Bleeding Breathing difficulty Blurred vision Eyelid drooping Low blood pressure Nausea and vomiting Numbness Pain at site of bite Paralysis Rapid pulse Skin color changes Swelling Tingling Tissue damage Thirst Tiredness Weakness Weak pulse
Cottonmouth and copperhead bites are painful right when they occur. Symptoms, which usually begin right away, may include:
Bleeding Breathing difficulty Low blood pressure Nausea and vomiting Numbness and tingling Pain at site of bite Shock Skin color changes Swelling Thirst Tiredness Tissue damage Weakness Weak pulse
Coral snake bites may be painless at first. Major symptoms may not develop for hours. Do NOT make the mistake of thinking you will be fine if the bite area looks good and you are not in a lot of pain. Untreated coral snake bites can be deadly. Symptoms may include:
Blurred vision Breathing difficulty Convulsions Drowsiness Eyelid drooping Headache Low blood pressure Mouth watering (excessive salivation) Nausea and vomiting Numbness Pain and swelling at site of bite Paralysis Shock Slurred speech Swallowing difficulty Swelling of tongue and throat Weakness Skin color changes Skin tissue damage Stomach or abdominal pain Weak pulse"
5030,What causes Snakebites?,"Poisonous snake bites include bites by any of the following:
Cobra Copperhead Coral snake Cottonmouth (water moccasin) Rattlesnake Various snakes found at zoos
All snakes will bite when threatened or surprised, but most will usually avoid people if possible and only bite as a last resort.
Snakes found in and near water are often mistaken as being poisonous. Most species of snake are harmless and many bites are not life-threatening, but unless you are absolutely sure that you know the species, treat it seriously."
5031,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Snakebites (Patient information)?,"Call 911 or your local emergency number if someone has been bitten by a snake. If possible, call ahead to the emergency room so that antivenom can be ready when the person arrives.
You may also call the National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222). The center can be called from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."

5033,What causes Chronic renal failure?,"End-stage kidney disease (ESRD) occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to function at a level needed for day-to-day life. It usually occurs when chronic kidney disease has worsened to the point at which kidney function is less than 10% of normal.
ESRD almost always follows chronic kidney disease. A person may have gradual worsening of kidney function for 10 - 20 years or more before progressing to ESRD.
Patients who have reached this stage need dialysis or a kidney transplant.
The most common causes of ESRD in the U.S. are diabetes and high blood pressure."
5034,Who is at highest risk for Chronic renal failure ?,"Certain conditions increases your risk of chronic renal failure, which are as follows
Diabetes High blood pressure (hypertension) Heart disease Smoking Obesity High cholesterol African-American, American Indian or Asian-American race Family history of kidney disease Age 65 or older"
5035,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chronic renal failure ?,"You must make an appointment with the doctor, if you have any symptoms and sign listed above. If you have any chronic medical condition, your doctor might do a regular check of your Blood pressure and kidney functions."
5036,What to expect if I have Chronic renal failure  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Without dialysis or a kidney transplant, death will occur from the buildup of fluids and waste products in the body. Both of these treatments can have serious risks and consequences. The outcome is different for each person."
5037,What are the symptoms of Membranous glomerulonephritis?,"Symptoms often begin slowly over time, and may include:
Edema (swelling) in any area of the body Foamy appearance of urine Weight gain Poor appetite Urination, excessive at night Hypertension (patient information)| High blood pressure Fatigue"
5038,What causes Membranous glomerulonephritis?,"Membranous nephropathy is caused by thickening of part of the glomerular basement membrane. Glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. The exact reason for this thickening is not known.
It is one of the most common causes of nephritic syndrome. The condition may be a primary kidney disease of uncertain origin, or it may be associated with other conditions."
5039,Who is at highest risk for Membranous glomerulonephritis ?,"The following increase your risk for this condition:
Exposure to toxins, including gold and mercury. Use of certain medicines, including penicillamine, trimethadione, and skin-lightening creams. Infections, including hepatitis B, malaria, syphilis, and endocarditis. Blood cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Grave`s disease, and other autoimmune disorders.
The disorder occurs in approximately 2 out of 10,000 people. It may occur at any age but is more common after age 40."
5040,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Membranous glomerulonephritis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms indicate membranous nephropathy may be present. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms worsen or persist, if you experience a decreased urine output or other new symptom develops."
5041,What to expect if I have Membranous glomerulonephritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook varies. There may be symptom-free periods and acute flare ups. In some cases, the condition may go away with or without therapy.
The majority of patients will have some degree of irreversible kidney damage within 2-20 years. About 20% of those will progress to end-stage renal disease."
5042,What are the symptoms of Renal papillary necrosis?,"Necrosis (tissue death) of the renal papillae may make the kidney unable to concentrate the urine. Symptoms may include:
Back pain or flank pain Bloody urine Cloudy urine Dark, rust-colored, or brown urine Tissue in the urine
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease:
Chills Incontinence Increased urinary frequency or urgency Painful urination Passing large amounts of urine Urinating frequently at night Urinary hesitancy"
5043,What causes Renal papillary necrosis?,"Renal papillary necrosis is most commonly associated with analgesic nephropathy. However, a number of conditions can cause this condition, including:
Diabetic nephropathy Kidney infection Kidney transplant rejection Urinary tract obstruction Sickle cell anemia Sickle cell anemia is a common cause of renal papillary necrosis in children."
5044,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Renal papillary necrosis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have bloody urine. Also call if other symptoms of renal papillary necrosis develop, especially after taking over-the-counter pain medications."
5045,What to expect if I have Renal papillary necrosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well a person does depends on the underlying condition. If the underlying disorder can be controlled, the condition may go away on its own. In some cases, persons with this condition develop kidney failure."
5046,What are the symptoms of Renal vein thrombosis?,Blood clot to the lung Bloody urine Decreased urine output Flank pain or low back pain
5047,What causes Renal vein thrombosis?,"Renal vein thrombosis is an uncommon disorder that may be caused by:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm Clotting disorders Dehydration (mostly in infants) Estrogen use Nephrotic syndrome Pregnancy Scar formation with pressure on the renal vein Trauma (to the back or abdomen) Tumor
In adults, the most common cause is nephrotic syndrome. In infants, the most common cause is dehydration."
5048,Who is at highest risk for Renal vein thrombosis ?,Its a relatively less common disease but any of the above mentioned condition can predispose risk for renal vein thrombosis.
5049,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Renal vein thrombosis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of renal vein thrombosis.
If you have experienced renal vein thrombosis, call your health care provider if you develop decreased urine output, difficulty breathing, or other new symptoms."
5050,What to expect if I have Renal vein thrombosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Renal vein thrombosis usually gets better over time without permanently injuring the kidneys.
5051,What are the symptoms of Dehydration?,Dry or sticky mouth Lethargy or coma (with severe dehydration) Low or no urine output; urine looks dark yellow No tears Sunken eyes Sunken fontanelles (the soft spot on the top of the head) in an infant
5052,What causes Dehydration?,"Dehydration can be caused by losing too much fluid, not drinking enough water or fluids, or both.
Your body may lose too much fluids from:
Excessive sweating (for example, from exercise) Excessive urine output, such as with uncontrolled diabetes or diuretic use Fever Vomiting or diarrhea
You might not drink enough fluids because of:
Loss of appetite due to illness Nausea Sore throat or mouth sores
Dehydration in sick children is often a combination of refusing to eat or drink anything and losing fluid from vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. Infants and children are more likely to become dehydrated than adults because they weigh less and their bodies turn over water and electrolytes more quickly. The elderly and people with illnesses are also at higher risk."
5053,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dehydration ?,"Call 911 if you or your child have the following symptoms:
Confusion Dizziness Lethargy Light-headedness
Call your health care provider right away if you or your child has any of the following symptoms:

Call your health care provider if you are not sure whether you are giving your child enough fluids.
Also call your health care provider if:
You or your child cannot keep down fluids during an illness Vomiting has been going on for longer than 24 hours in an adult or longer than 12 hours in a child Diarrhea has lasted longer than 5 days in an adult or child Your infant or child is much less active than usual or is irritable You or your child is urinating much more than normal, especially if there is a family history of diabetes or you are taking diuretics"
5054,What to expect if I have Dehydration  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When dehydration is found and treated quickly, the outcome is usually good."
5055,What are the symptoms of Porphyria?,"Porphyrias involve three major symptoms:
Abdominal pain or cramping (only in some forms of the disease) Light sensitivity causing rashes, blistering, and scarring of the skin (photodermatitis) Problems with the nervous system and muscles seizures, mental disturbances, nerve damage)
Attacks can occur suddenly, usually with severe abdominal pain followed by vomiting and constipation. Being out in the sun can cause pain, sensations of heat, blistering, and skin redness and swelling. Blisters heal slowly, often with scarring or skin color changes. They may be disfiguring. Urine may turn red or brown after an attack.
Other symptoms may include:
Muscle pain Muscle weakness or paralysis Numbness or tingling Pain in the arms or legs Pain in the back Personality changes
Attacks can sometimes be life threatening, producing:
Low blood pressure Severe electrolyte imbalances Shock"
5056,What causes Porphyria ?,"Normally, the body makes heme in a multi-step process. Porphyrins are made during several steps of this process. Patients with porphyria have a deficiency of certain enzymes needed for this process. This causes abnormal amounts of porphyrins or related chemicals to build up in the body.
There are many different forms of porphyria. The most common type is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).
Drugs, infection, alcohol, and hormones such as estrogen may trigger attacks of certain types of porphyria."
5057,When to Contact a Medical Professional ?,"Seek medical attention as soon as you have signs of an acute attack. Talk to your doctor about your risk for this condition if you have a long history of undiagnosed abdominal pain, muscle and nerve problems, and sensitivity to sunlight."
5058,What to expect if I have Porphyria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Porphyrias are life-long diseases with symptoms that come and go. Some forms of the disease cause more symptoms than others. Proper treatment and avoidance of triggers can help prolong the time between attacks.
5059,What are the symptoms of Snoring?,"Snoring is common in adults and is not necessarily a sign of an underlying disorder.
Snoring sometimes can be a sign of a sleep disorder called sleep apnea. This means you have periods when you completely or partly stop breathing for more than 10 seconds while you sleep. The episode is followed by a sudden snort or gasp when breathing resumes. Then, snoring starts all over again. If you have sleep apnea, this cycle generally happens multiple times a night.
Sleep apnea is not as common as snoring.
Snoring is an important social problem. Persons who share a bed with a someone who snores can develop sleep difficulties."
5060,What causes Snoring?,"In most people, the reason for snoring is not known. Some potential causes (other than sleep apnea) include:
Being overweight, which leads to excessive neck tissue that puts pressure on the airways Last month of pregnancy Nasal congestion from colds or allergies, especially if it lasts a long time Swelling of the muscular part of the roof of the mouth (soft palate) or uvula, the piece of tissue that hangs down in the back of the mouth Swollen adenoids and tonsils that block the airways Use of sleeping pills, antihistamines, or alcohol at bedtime Prominence of the area at the base of the tongue Large tongue size compared to the mouth Abnormalities in the bones of the face"
5061,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Snoring ?,"Talk to your doctor if you have: Excessive daytime drowsiness Morning headaches Recent weight gain Awakening in the morning not feeling rested Change in your level of attention, concentration, or memory Episodes of no breathing (apnea): your partner may need to tell you if this is happening
Children with chronic snoring should also be evaluated for apnea.
Sleep apnea in children has been linked to:
Growth problems ADHD Poor school performance Learning difficulties Bedwetting High blood pressure
Most children who snore do NOT have apnea, but a sleep study is the only reliable way to tell for sure"
5062,What are the symptoms of Ewing's sarcoma?,"Usual symptoms of Ewing's sarcoma include:
Pain at the site of the tumor
Swelling at the site of the tumor
Pathological fracture
Fever

5063,What causes Ewing's sarcoma?,"Ewing's sarcoma can occur any time during childhood and young adulthood, but usually develops during puberty, when bones are growing rapidly. It is 10 times as common in Caucasian children as in African-American, African, and Asian children.
The tumor may arise anywhere in the body, usually in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It may also develop in the skull or the flat bones of the trunk.
The tumor often spreads (metastasis) to the lungs and other bones. Metastasis at the time of diagnosis is present in approximately one-third of children with Ewing's sarcoma. Rarely, Ewing's sarcoma can occur in adults."

Diseases of the Bladder and prostate such as malignancy, stones, or obstruction of the urinary tract."
5070,What causes Acute tubular necrosis?,"Acute tubular necrosis is caused by lack of blood supply (ischemia) and oxygenation to the kidneys. It is also caused by various medications such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, NSAIDs, and also caused by exposure to radiocontrast media (the dye used for x-ray and other radiographic studies) The internal structures of the kidney, particularly the tissues of the kidney tubule, become damaged or destroyed. Acute tubular necrosis is one of the most common structural changes that can lead to acute kidney injury."
5071,Who is at highest risk for Acute tubular necrosis ?,"Acute tubular necrosis is one of the most common causes of kidney failure in hospitalized patients.
Recent major surgery Septic shock or other forms of shock Severe low blood pressure (hypotension) Injury or trauma that damages the muscles Blood transfusion reaction Kidney damage caused by diabetes (diabetic nephropathy) may make a person more susceptible to the condition."

5074,What to expect if I have Acute tubular necrosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The duration of symptoms varies. The decreased urine output phase may last from a few days to 6 weeks or more. This is occasionally followed by a period of high urine output, where the healed and newly functioning kidneys try to clear the body of fluid and wastes. One or two days after urine output rises, symptoms reduce and laboratory values begin to return to normal."
5075,What are the symptoms of Analgesic nephropathy?,"There may be no symptoms. Symptoms of chronic kidney disease are often present over time and may include:
Weakness Fatigue Increased urinary frequency or urgency Blood in the urine Flank pain or back pain Decreased urine output Decreased alertness Drowsiness Confusion, delirium Lethargy Decreased sensation, numbness (especially in the legs) Nausea, vomiting Easy bruising or bleeding Swelling, generalized"
5076,What causes Analgesic nephropathy?,"Analgesic nephropathy involves damage within the internal structures of the kidney. It is caused by long-term use of analgesics, especially over-the-counter (OTC) medications that contain phenacetin or acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen.
About 6 or more pills per day for 3 years increases the risk some for this problem. This frequently occurs as a result of self-medicating, often for some type of chronic pain.
Analgesic nephropathy occurs in about 4 out of 100,000 people, mostly women over 30. The rate has decreased significantly since phenacetin is no longer widely available in OTC preparations."

Bladder infection
A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer."
5082,Who is at highest risk for Bladder cancer ?,"Common risk factors of bladder cancer include:
Age
The chance of getting bladder cancer goes up as people get older. People under 40 rarely get this disease.
Cigarette smoking
Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Up to half of all bladder cancers in men and several in women may be caused by cigarette smoke.
Chemical exposure
About one in four cases of bladder cancer is caused by coming into contact with to cancer-causing chemicals at work. These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk.
Chemotherapy
The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) may increase the risk of bladder cancer.
Radiation treatment
Women who had radiation therapy to treat cervical cancer have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer.
Bladder infection
A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer.
Race
Whites get bladder cancer twice as often as African Americans and Hispanics. The lowest rates are among Asians.
Being a man

Family history
People with family members who have bladder cancer are more likely to get the disease."
5083,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bladder cancer ?,See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms associated with bladder cancer
5084,What to expect if I have Bladder cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of bladder cancer depends on location and stage of the disease. When diagnosed early there is a better chance of recovery than when it is diagnosed during advanced stages.
5085,How is the dialysis done?,"Hemodialysis works by removing blood from the body and having it flow across a special filter, along with solutions. The filter helps remove toxins. The blood is then returned to the body.
Hemodialysis requires special ways to access the blood in the blood vessels. Access may be needed on a short-term (temporary) or long-term (permanent) basis.
Temporary access involves placing dialysis catheters (hollow tubes) into larger veins, usually in your neck, chest, or leg near the groin. They are most often used in emergency situations for short periods of time. However, catheters called tunneled catheters can be used for weeks or even months.
Permanent access is created by surgically joining an artery to a vein, usually in the arm. This vein becomes thickened over time. To perform the dialysis, blood is removed and returned through the vein. There are two methods to create this access:
An artery and a vein are directly connected to each other. Then, over a period of months, these blood vessels form a connection called a fistula (an arteriovenous fistula, or AVF). A man-made bridge (arteriovenous graft, or AVG) can also be used to connect the artery and vein. An AVG can be used for dialysis within several weeks. An AVF has a lower chance for infections than an AVG and usually lasts longer before it needs to be replaced.
During a hemodialysis session, one or two needles must be inserted into the fistula or graft.
It is important to stick to the diet and medicines the dialysis staff and your kidney specialist (nephrologist) prescribed."
5086,Who needs dialysis?,"The kidneys function as filters for the blood, removing waste products. They also help:
Manage how much water is in the body Maintain the balance of sodium, potassium, phosphorous, and other minerals and vitamins in the body Ensure that the blood pH remains between 7.35 and 7.45 Dialysis replaces some of the functions when the kidneys are no longer working. A buildup of waste products and other imbalances would lead to death if dialysis did not perform these functions."
5087,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dialysis ?,"Dialysis is started after a gradual loss of kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease. Your doctor and nurse will begin discussing dialysis with you before you need it.
Dialysis also may be used when the kidneys suddenly stop working (also called acute renal failure). On occasion, dialysis can be used to quickly remove drugs or poisons from the body."
5088,Where to find centers that perform dialysis?,"Directions to Hospitals Treating Dialysis
Most often, hemodialysis takes place in a special dialysis center. Patients usually have three treatments per week, during which they must sit in a chair for 3-4 hours. Many people feel tired for several hours after the dialysis.
Most dialysis centers have a very busy schedule. Patients who are late may not be able to make up the time. Because the body continues to make waste products and take on extra fluid between dialysis sessions, you must closely follow a kidney dialysis diet.
Some people can do hemodialysis at home, avoiding having to travel back and forth to a dialysis center. Home dialysis is usually done using one of two schedules:
Shorter (2 - 3 hours) treatments done at least 5 - 7 days per week Longer nightly treatments done 3 - 6 nights per week while you are sleeping Home hemodialysis treatments help keep blood pressure lower. Many patients no longer need blood pressure medicines. The longer nightly treatments do a better job of removing waste products. They are done more slowly and are therefore easier on the heart and access site (AVF or AGF).
A dialysis nurse can train patients to do home dialysis. Patients do not have to buy a machine. Supplies can be delivered. Both the patient and any caregivers must learn to:
Handle the equipment Place the needle into the access site Monitor the machine and blood pressure during treatment Keep records Clean the machine Order supplies"
5089,What to expect if I have Dialysis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"You should know how to take care of your Graft or Fistula?
Avoid all pressure on the access site. If the graft or fistula clots, you may need a new one. Do not allow anyone to take a blood pressure reading on the same arm with the access. Do not wear tight clothing around the access site or on the arm. Avoid placing pressure on the arm with the access while you sleep. Avoid placing pressure on the arm when you are lifting heavy items. Do not allow any blood to be drawn from the arm. Do not use creams or lotions over the access site. Learn how to feel the access site for the ""thrill."" This indicates that the AV site is still functioning. If the thrill disappears, call your health care provider immediately.
Do not miss or skip any dialysis sessions.
Observe the access site after dialysis, watching for swelling, infection, or bleeding. Call your health care provider immediately if you have a fever or other sign of infection."
5090,What are the symptoms of Dysuria?,"Pain may be felt right where the urine passes out of the body. Or, it may be felt inside the body, behind the public bone, or in the bladder or prostate.
Pain on urination is a fairly common problem. Peole who have pain with urination also may have the urge to urinate more often."
5091,What causes Dysuria?,"Painful urination is most often caused by:
Infection or inflammation somewhere in the urinary tract Urethritis (in men) caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia

5095,What are the symptoms of Erectile dysfunction?,"The patient with Erectile dysfunction can have the following symptoms:
Failure to have an erection. Failure to maintain an erection. Reduced sexual desire."
5096,What causes Erectile dysfunction?,"An erection requires the interaction of your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels. Anything that interferes with the normal process can lead to a problem.
Common causes of erection problems include:
Diseases and conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor blood flow, depression, or neurologic disorders (such as multiple *sclerosis or Parkinson's disease) Medications such as blood pressure medications (especially beta-blockers), heart medications (such as digoxin), some peptic ulcer medications, sleeping pills, and *antidepressants Nerve damage from prostate surgery Nicotine, alcohol, or cocaine use Poor communication with your partner Repeated feelings of doubt and failure or negative communication that reinforce the erection problems Spinal cord injury Stress, fear, anxiety, or anger Unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure"
5097,Who is at highest risk for Erectile dysfunction ?,"Erection problems tend to become more common as you age, but they can affect men at any age and at any time in their lives. Physical causes are more common in older men, while psychological causes are more common in younger men.
Low levels of testosterone rarely lead to erection problems, but may reduce a man's sex drive."
5098,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Erectile dysfunction ?,"Call your doctor if:
The problem does not go away with self-care measures -- effective treatments are available The problem begins after an injury or prostate surgery You have other symptoms like low back pain, abdominal pain, or change in urination
If erection problems seem to be caused by a medication you are taking for an unrelated condition, consult your doctor. You may benefit from reducing the dose of the drug or changing to another drug that has the same result but not the same side effects. DO NOT change or stop taking any medications without first talking to your doctor.
Talk to your health care provider if your erection problems are related to fear of recurring heart problems. Sexual intercourse is usually safe in these circumstances.
Call your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room if medication for erection problems give you an unwanted erection that lasts more than 4 hours. Permanent impotence or other lasting damage to your penis may result from this condition."
5099,What to expect if I have Erectile dysfunction  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,ED is significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Lung symptoms may include:
Dry cough, may cough up blood (bloody sputum) Difficulty breathing after activity
Kidney and other symptoms include:
Swelling (edema) in any area of the body Burning sensation when urinating Bloody urine High blood pressure Nausea and vomiting Pale skin"
5110,What causes Goodpasture syndrome?,"Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disorder, a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. Persons with this syndrome develop substances that attack a protein called collagen in the tiny air sacs in the lungs and the filtering units (glomureli) of the kidney.
These substances are called anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. Glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Anti-glomerular basement membrane are antibodies against this membrane. They can lead to kidney damage.
Sometimes the disorder is triggered by a viral respiratory infection or by breathing in hydrocarbon solvents. In such cases, the immune system may attack organs or tissues because it mistakes them for these viruses or foreign chemicals.
The immune system's faulty response causes bleeding in the air sacs and inflammation in the kidney's filtering units."

Many people have hematuria without any other related problems. Often no specific cause can be found. But because hematuria may be the result of a tumor or other serious problem, a doctor should be consulted."
5126,Who is at highest risk for Hematuria ?,"People of all age group including children can have hematuria. Certain factors increase the chances of getting hematuria
Recent infection: Postinfectious glomerulonephritis Exercise: Long distance runners are prone to exercise induced urinary bleeding. Age: An enlarged prostate in males older than 50 can cause hematuria. Sex: 50% of all women suffer from urinary tract infection at least once in their life time, which can also cause urinary bleeding."
5127,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hematuria ?,"Blood in the urine should never be ignored. Tell your doctor about this symptom and get an appropriate evaluation, especially if you have unexplained weight loss, discomfort with urination, frequent urination, or urgent urination.
Call your doctor right away if:
You have fever, nausea, vomiting, shaking chills, or pain in your abdomen, side, or back You are unable to urinate You are passing blood clots in your urine

5129,Is on-line intermittent hemodiafiltration (IHDF) better than regular hemodialysis?,"There is current controversy about whether intermittent on-line hemodiafiltration (IHDF) gives better results than hemodialysis in an outpatient setting. In Europe, several observational studies have compared outcomes in patients getting dialysis with those getting IHDF. These have suggested a lower mortality rate and other favorable outcomes in patients getting IHDF vs. those getting ordinary hemodialysis.  However, the issue is not settled at this time, because the required randomized controlled clinical trials have not been done. Another problem has been that in several of the trials done, IHDF was compared to dialysis using low-flux (small pore) membranes, and the benefit found may have been due more to the use of a high-flux membrane than to the addition of convective transport (filtration) to dialysis. A recent Cochrane database review  of available trials could not find a definite benefit of either IHF or IHDF vs. hemodialysis in terms of outcomes."
5130,What are the symptoms of Metabolic alkalosis?,"Patients suffering from Metabolic alkalosis usually appear restless, irritable.

Symptoms of underactive bladder:
Bladder becomes too full and you may leak urine Problems starting to urinate or emptying all the urine from the bladder Unable to tell when the bladder is full Urinary retention"
5136,What causes Neurogenic bladder?,"Several muscles and nerves must work together for your bladder to hold urine until you're ready to empty it. Nerve messages go back and forth between the brain and the muscles that control bladder emptying. If these nerves are damaged by illness or injury, the muscles may not be able to tighten or relax at the right time.
Disorders of the central nervous system commonly cause neurogenic bladder. This can include:
Alzheimer's disease Meningomyelocele Brain or spinal cord tumors Multiple sclerosis Parkinson disease Spinal cord injury Stroke recovery

5140,What causes Obstructive uropathy?,"Obstructive uropathy occurs when urine cannot drain through a ureter (a tube that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder). Urine backs up into the kidney and causes it to become swollen (hydronephrosis).
Obstructive uropathy is grouped according to whether it affects one or both kidneys and whether it occurs suddenly or is long-term:
Chronic unilateral obstructive uropathy - Long-term uropathy that affects one kidney Chronic bilateral obstructive uropathy - Long-term uropathy that affects both kidneys Acute unilateral obstructive uropathy - Sudden uropathy that affects one kidney Acute bilateral obstructive uropathy - Sudden uropathy that affects both kidneys
Common causes of obstructive uropathy include the following:

5141,Who is at highest risk for Obstructive uropathy ?,Presence of any of the above mentioned condition increases the risk for the patient.
5142,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Obstructive uropathy ?,Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of obstructive uropathy or believe that you may be suffering from this condition.
5143,What to expect if I have Obstructive uropathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If an acute obstruction is rapidly diagnosed and repaired, kidney damage is minimal or reversible -- regardless of being unilateral or bilateral.
If chronic unilateral obstruction is not relieved promptly, there could be permanent damage to the kidney. Chronic unilateral obstruction usually does not cause kidney insufficiency or failure because most patients have normal function from the other kidney.
Chronic bilateral obstruction may lead to kidney insufficiency or failure because both kidneys may become damaged and fail to function even after the obstruction is repaired."
5144,What are the symptoms of Polydipsia?,Patient have a tendency to drink excess amount of water.
5145,What causes Polydipsia?,"A recent salty or spicy meal Bleeding enough to cause a significant decrease in blood volume Diabetes Diabetes insipidus Drugs such as anticholinergics, demeclocycline, diuretics, phenothiazines Excessive loss of water and salt (possibly due to not drinking enough water, profuse sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting) Loss of body fluids from the bloodstream into the tissues due to: Conditions such as severe infections (sepsis) or burns Heart, liver, or kidney failure Psychogenic polydipsia, the result of a mental disorder"
5146,Who is at highest risk for Polydipsia ?,A patient having any of the above mentioned condition can develop Polydipsia.
5147,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Polydipsia ?,"Excessive thirst is persistent and unexplained Thirst is accompanied by other unexplained symptoms, such as blurry vision and fatigue You are passing more than 5 quarts of urine per day"
5148,What to expect if I have Polydipsia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Prognosis depends on the underlying cause.
5149,What are the symptoms of Reflux nephropathy?,"Some people have no symptoms of reflux nephropathy. The problem may be found when kidney tests are done for other reasons.
If symptoms do occur, they might be similar to those of:
Chronic kidney failure Nephrotic syndrome Urinary tract infection"
5150,What causes Reflux nephropathy?,"Urine flows from each kidney through tubes called ureters and into the bladder. When the bladder is full, it squeezes and sends the urine out through the urethra. None of the urine should flow back into the ureter when the bladder is squeezing. Each ureter has a one-way valve where it enters the bladder that prevents urine from flowing back up the ureter.
But in some people, urine flows back up to the kidney. This is called vesicoureteral reflux.
Over time, the kidneys may be damaged or scarred by this reflux. This is called reflux nephropathy
Reflux can occur in people whose ureters do not attach properly to the bladder or whose valves do not work well. Children may be born with this problem or may have other birth defects of the urinary system that cause reflux nephropathy.
Reflux nephropathy can occur with other conditions that lead to a blockage of urine flow, including:
Bladder outlet obstruction, such as an enlarged prostate in men Bladder stones Neurogenic bladder, which can occur in people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or other nervous system (neurological) conditions
Reflux nephropathy also can occur from swelling of the ureters after a kidney transplant or from injury to the ureter."
5151,Who is at highest risk for Reflux nephropathy ?,"Risk factors for reflux nephropathy include:
Abnormalities of the urinary tract Personal or family history of vesicoureteral reflux Repeat urinary tract infections"
5152,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Reflux nephropathy ?,"Call your health care provider if you:
Have symptoms of reflux nephropathy Have other new symptoms Are producing less urine than normal"
5153,What to expect if I have Reflux nephropathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies, depending on the severity of the reflux. Some people with reflux nephropathy will not lose kidney function over time, even though their kidneys are damaged. However, kidney damage may be permanent. If only one kidney is involved, the other kidney should keep working normally.
Reflux nephropathy may cause kidney failure in both children and adults."
5154,What are the symptoms of Renovascular hypertension?,"People with renovascular hypertension may have a history of high blood pressure that is severe and hard to control with medication.
Symptoms of renovascular hypertension include:
High blood pressure at a young age High blood pressure that suddenly gets worse or is difficult to control Kidneys that are not working well, which often occurs suddenly Narrowing of other arteries in the body, such as to the legs, the brain, the eyes and elsewhere Sudden buildup of fluid in the air sacs of the lungs (pulmonary edema)
If you have a severe headache, nausea or vomiting, bad headache, confusion, changes in your vision, or nosebleeds you may have a severe and dangerous form of high blood pressure called malignant hypertension."
5155,What causes Renovascular hypertension?,"When the arteries that carry blood to your kidneys become narrow, less blood flows to the kidneys. The kidneys mistakenly respond as if your blood pressure is low and make hormones that tell the body to hold on to more salt and water. This causes your blood pressure to rise.
Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing or blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the kidneys.
The most common cause of renal artery stenosis is a blockage in the the arteries due to high cholesterol. This problem occurs when a sticky, fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner lining of the arteries. The plaque may slowly narrow or even block the renal (kidney) artery.
Risk factors for atherosclerosis include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, heavy alcohol use, cocaine abuse, and increasing age.
Fibromuscular dysplasia is another cause of renal artery stenosis. It is often seen in women under age 50 and tends to run in families. It is caused by abnormal growth of cells in the walls of the arteries leading to the kidneys. This also leads to narrowing or blockage of these arteries."
5156,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Renal artery stenosis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you think you have high blood pressure.
Call your health care provider if you have renovascular hypertension and symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment. Also call if new symptoms develop."
5157,What are the symptoms of Urinary incontinence?,"Frequent urination, in the daytime and at night Involuntary loss of urine Sudden and urgent need to urinate (urinary urgency)"
5158,What causes Urinary incontinence?,"Urge incontinence may result from:
Bladder cancer Bladder inflammation Bladder outlet obstruction Bladder stones Infection Neurological diseases (such as multiple sclerosis) Neurological injuries (such as spinal cord injury or stroke)
In men, urge incontinence also may be due to:
Bladder changes caused by benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) Bladder outlet obstruction from an enlarged prostate
In most cases of urge incontinence, no specific cause can be identified.
Although urge incontinence may occur in anyone at any age, it is more common in women and the elderly."
5159,Who is at highest risk for Urinary incontinence ?,Presence of any of the above disease mentioned above increasing your frequency.
5160,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Urinary incontinence ?,"Call your health care provider for an appointment if:
Your symptoms are causing you problems You have pelvic discomfort or burning with urination Your symptoms occur daily"
5161,What to expect if I have Urinary incontinence  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well you do depends on your symptoms, an accurate diagnosis, and proper treatment. Many patients must try different therapies (some at the same time) to reduce symptoms.
Instant improvement is unusual. Perseverance and patience are usually required to see improvement. A small number of patients need surgery to control their symptoms."
5162,What are the symptoms of Urinary urgency?,"Urgent urination is a sudden, compelling urge to urinate, along with discomfort in your bladder. A frequent need to urinate at night is called nocturia. Most people can sleep for 6 to 8 hours without having to urinate. Middle aged and older men often wake to urinate once in the early morning hours."
5163,What causes Urinary urgency?,"Together, frequent and urgent urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.
Diabetes, pregnancy, and prostate problems are other common causes of these symptoms.
Other causes include:
Anxiety Enlarged prostate Interstitial cystitis Medicines such as diuretics Overactive bladder syndrome Prostatitis (infection of the prostate gland) Stroke and other brain or nervous system diseases Tumor or mass in the pelvis Urinary incontinence Vaginitis
Less common causes:
Bladder cancer Bladder dysfunction Radiation therapy to the pelvis, used to treat certain cancers Drinking too much before bedtime, especially caffeine or alcohol, can cause frequent urination at nighttime. Frequent urination may also simply just be a habit.
Home Care Follow the therapy recommended by your doctor to treat the underlying cause of your urinary frequency or urgency. It may help to keep a diary of times and amounts of urine voided to bring with you to the doctor.
In some cases, you may experience some urinary incontinence for a period of time. You may need to take steps to protect your clothing and bedding."
5164,Who is at highest risk for Urinary urgency ?,Presence of any of the above disease mentioned above increasing your frequency
5165,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Urinary urgency ?,"Call your health care provider for an appointment if:
Your symptoms are causing you problems You have pelvic discomfort or burning with urination Your symptoms occur daily"
5166,What to expect if I have Urinary urgency  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well you do depends on your symptoms, an accurate diagnosis, and proper treatment. Many patients must try different therapies (some at the same time) to reduce symptoms.
Instant improvement is unusual. Perseverance and patience are usually required to see improvement. A small number of patients need surgery to control their symptoms."
5167,What are the symptoms of Varicocele?,"Enlarged, twisted veins in the scrotum Infertility Painless testicle lump, scrotal swelling, or bulge within the scrotum
There may not be symptoms."
5168,What causes Varicocele?,"A varicocele forms when valves inside the veins along the spermatic cord prevent blood from flowing properly. This causes the blood to back up, leading to swelling and widening of the veins. (This is essentially the same process that leads to varicose veins, which are common in the legs.)"
5169,Who is at highest risk for Varicocele ?,"Varicoceles usually develop slowly. They are more common in men ages 15 - 25 and are most often seen on the left side of the scrotum. Varicoceles are often the cause of infertility in men.
The sudden appearance of a varicocele in an older man may be caused by a kidney tumor, which can block blood flow to a vein. This is more common on the left side than the right."
5170,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Varicocele ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you discover a testicle lump or need to treat a diagnosed varicocele.
5171,What to expect if I have Varicocele  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"A varicocele is usually harmless and often requires no treatment. If surgery is required because of infertility or testicular wasting away (atrophy), the sperm count will likely improve but the ultimate pregnancy rate is unchanged. In most cases, testicular wasting (atrophy) does not improve unless surgery is done early in adolescence."
5172,What are the symptoms of Wilms' tumor?,Abdominal pain Constipation Fever General discomfort or uneasiness (malaise) High blood pressure Increased growth on only one side of the body Loss of appetite Nausea Swelling in the abdomen (abdominal hernia or mass) Vomiting Abnormal urine color may also be associated with this disease.
5173,What causes Wilms' tumor?,"Wilms tumor is the most common form of childhood kidney cancer. The exact cause of this tumor in most children is unknown.
A missing iris of the eye (aniridia) is a birth defect that is sometimes associated with Wilms tumor. Other birth defects linked to this type of kidney cancer include certain urinary tract problems and enlargement of one side of the body, a condition called hemihypertrophy."
5174,Who is at highest risk for Wilms%27 tumor ?,"It is more common among some siblings and twins, which suggests a possible genetic cause.
The disease occurs in about 1 out of 200,000 to 250,000 children. It usually strikes when a child is about 3 years old. It rarely develops after age 8."
5175,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Wilms%27 tumor ?,"Call your health care provider if you discover a lump in your child's abdomen, blood in the urine, or other symptoms of Wilms tumor.
Call your health care provider if your child is being treated for this condition and symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop, particularly cough, chest pain, weight loss, or persistent fevers."
5176,What to expect if I have Wilms%27 tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Children whose tumor has not spread have a 90% cure rate with appropriate treatment.
5177,What are the causes of Amnesia ?,"There are many areas of the brain that help you create and retrieve memories. Damage or malfunction of any of these areas can lead to memory loss.
Memory loss due to problems with specific brain areas may be different. It may involve only memory of recent or new events, passed or remote events, or both. the amnesia may be only for specific events or for all events. The problem may involve learning new information or forming new memories.
Mental or thinking abilities may still be present or may have been lost. Filling in the details with imagined events (confabulation), and disorientation to time and place may occur.
Memory loss may be for words and thoughts only, or for motor memory (the body can no longer perform specific actions). Memory loss may also be partial, meaning failing to remember only a selected group of items.
Memory loss may be short-term (called transient).
Causes of memory loss include:
Alcohol or ilicit drug intoxication An event in which not enough oxygen was going to the brain (heart stopped, stopped breathing, complications from receiving anesthesia) Brain growths (caused by tumors or infection) Brain infections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, or HIV / AIDS Brain surgery, such as surgery to treat seizure disorders Cancer treatments, such as brain radiation, bone marrow transplant, or after chemotherapy Certain medications Certain types of seizures Dementia Depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia when symptoms have not been well controlled Dissociative disorder (not being able to remember a major, traumatic event; the memory loss may be short-term or long-term) Drugs such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines Electroconvulsive therapy (especially if it is long-term) Encephalitis of any type (infection, autoimmune disease, chemical/drug induced) Epilepsy that is not well controlled with medications Head trauma or injury Heart bypass surgery Illness that results in the loss of, or damage to nerve cells (neurodegenerative illness), such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or multiple sclerosis Long-term alcohol abuse Migraine headache Mild head injury or concussion Nutritional problems (vitamin deficiencies such as low vitamin B12) Permanent damage or injuries to the brain Transient global amnesia Transient ischemic attack (TIA)"
5178,Who is at highest risk for Amnesia ?,"The cause determines whether amnesia comes on slowly or suddenly, and whether it is temporary or permanent. Normal aging may lead to trouble learning new material or requiring a longer time to remember learned material. However, it does not lead to dramatic memory loss unless diseases are involved. Memory loss can be seen with impaired concentration, such as with depression. It can be hard to tell the difference."
5179,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Amnesia ?,Call your health care provider if you have any unexplained memory loss.
5180,What causes Amnesia?,"There are many areas of the brain that help you create and retrieve memories. Damage or malfunction of any of these areas can lead to memory loss.

5183,What are the symptoms of Cerebral hypoxia?,"Symptoms of mild cerebral hypoxia include:
Change in attention (inattentiveness) Poor judgment Uncoordinated movement
Symptoms of severe cerebral hypoxia include:
Complete unawareness and unresponsiveness (coma) No breathing No response of the pupils of the eye to light"
5184,What causes Cerebral hypoxia?,"In cerebral hypoxia, sometimes only the oxygen supply is interrupted. This can be caused by:
Breathing in smoke (smoke inhalation), such as during a fire Carbon monoxide poisoning Choking Diseases that prevent movement (paralysis) of the breathing muscles, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) High altitudes Pressure on (compression) the windpipe (trachea) Strangulation
In other cases, both oxygen and nutrient supply are stopped, caused by:
Cardiac arrest (when the heart stops pumping) Cardiac arrhythmia Complications of general anesthesia Drowning Drug overdose Injuries to a newborn that occurred before, during, or soon after birth (cerebral palsy) Stroke Very low blood pressure
Brain cells are extremely sensitive to a lack of oxygen. Some brain cells start dying less than 5 minutes after their oxygen supply disappears. As a result, brain hypoxia can rapidly cause severe brain damage or death."
5185,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cerebral hypoxia ?,Cerebral hypoxia is a medical emergency. Call 911 immediately if someone is losing consciousness or has other symptoms of cerebral hypoxia.
5186,What to expect if I have Cerebral hypoxia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on the extent of the brain injury. This is determined by how long the brain lacked oxygen, and whether nutrition to the brain was also affected.
If the brain lacked oxygen for only a very brief period of time, a coma may be reversible and the person may have a full or partial return of function. Some patients recover many functions, but have abnormal movements such as twitching or jerking, called myoclonus. Seizures may sometimes occur, and may be continuous (status epilepticus).
Most people who make a full recovery were only briefly unconscious. The longer a person is unconscious, the higher the risk for death or brain death, and the lower the chances of recovery."
5187,What are the symptoms of a cluster headache?,"A cluster headache begins as a severe, sudden headache. The headache most commonly strikes 2 to 3 hours after you fall asleep. However, the headache may occur while you are awake. The headache tends to occur at the same time of day.
The pain occurs on one side of the head. It may be described as:
Burning Sharp Steady
The pain may occur in, behind, and around one eye. It may:
Involve one side of the face from neck to temples Quickly get worse, peaking within 5 to 10 minutes
The strongest pain may last 30 minutes to 2 hours.
The eye and nose on the same side as the head pain may also be affected. Symptoms can include:
Swelling under or around the eye (may affect both eyes) Excessive tearing Red eye Rhinorrhea (runny nose) or one-sided stuffy nose (same side as the head pain) Red, flushed face
Cluster headaches may occur daily for months, alternating with periods without headaches (episodic), or they can recur for a year or more without stopping (chronic)."
5188,What causes a cluster headache?,"Cluster headaches are a fairly common form of chronic, repeated headaches. They are four times more common in men than women. The headaches can occur at any age but are most common in adolescence and middle age. They tend to run in families, passed down through genes.
Scientists do not know exactly what causes cluster headaches, but they appear to be related to the body's sudden release of histamine or serotonin. A problem in a small area at the base of the brain called the hypothalamus may be involved.
The following may trigger cluster attacks:
Alcohol and cigarette smoking High altitudes (trekking, air travel) Bright light (including sunlight) Exertion Heat (hot weather, hot baths) Foods high in nitrites (such as bacon and preserved meats) Certain medications Cocaine"
5189,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cluster headache ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
Cluster headaches do not respond to treatment Headaches disturb your sleep You get headaches whenever you are active Headaches occur with other symptoms
Danger symptoms require immediate medical care. Some of these symptoms include:
Changes in alertness Changes in movement or sensation Drowsiness Nausea or vomiting Seizures Vision changes"
5190,What to expect if I have Cluster headache  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If prone to cluster headache, stop smoking. Alcohol use and any foods that are associated with cluster headache may need to be avoided. Medications may prevent cluster headaches in some cases."
5191,What are the symptoms of Concussion?,"Symptoms of a concussion can range from mild to severe. They can include:
Altered level of consciousness (drowsy, hard to arouse, or similar changes)
Confusion, feeling spacey, or not thinking straight
Headache
Loss of consciousness
Memory loss (amnesia) of events before the injury or immediately after
Nausea and vomiting
Seeing flashing lights
Feeling like you have ""lost time""
The following are emergency symptoms of a concussion. Seek immediate medical care if there are:
Changes in alertness and consciousness
Convulsions (seizures)
Muscle weakness on one or both sides
Persistent confusion
Persistent unconsciousness (coma)
Repeated vomiting
Unequal pupils
Unusual eye movements
Walking problems
Head injuries that result in concussion often are associated with injury to the neck and spine. Take particular care when moving patients who have had a head injury.
While recovering from a concussion, you may:
Be withdrawn, easily upset, or confused
Have a hard time with tasks that require remembering or concentrating
Have mild headaches
Be less tolerant of noise"
5192,What causes Concussion?,"A concussion may result when the head hits an object or a moving object strikes the head.
A concussion can result from a fall, sports activities, and car accidents. Significant movement of the brain (called jarring) in any direction can cause you to lose alertness (become unconscious). How long you remain unconscious may be a sign of the severity of the concussion.
However, concussions don't always involve a loss of consciousness. Most people who have a concussion never black out. You can have a concussion and not realize it."
5193,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Concussion ?,"Call your health care provider if a head injury causes changes in alertness or produces any other worrisome symptoms.
If symptoms do not go away or are not improving after 2 or 3 weeks, talk to your doctor.
Call the doctor if the following symptoms occur:
Changes in behavior or unusual behavior
Changes in speech (slurred, difficult to understand, does not make sense)
Confusion
Difficulty waking up or becoming more sleepy
Double vision or blurred vision
Fever
Fluid or blood leaking from the nose or ears
Headache that is getting worse, lasts a long time, or does not get better with over-the-counter pain relievers
Problems walking or talking
Seizures
Vomiting more than three times"
5194,What to expect if I have Concussion  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Healing or recovering from a concussion takes time. It may take days, weeks, or even months. You may be irritable, have trouble concentrating, be unable to remember things, have headaches, dizziness, and blurry vision. These problems will probably go away slowly. You may want to get help from family or friends before making important decisions."
5195,What are the symptoms of Deafness?,"Symptoms of hearing loss may include:
Certain sounds seem too loud Difficulty following conversations when two or more people are talking Difficulty hearing in noisy areas Hard to tell high-pitched sounds (such as ""s"" or ""th"") from one another Less trouble hearing men's voices than women's voices Problems hearing when there is background noise Voices that sound mumbled or slurred
Other symptoms include:
Feeling of being off-balance or dizzy (more common with Meniere's disease and acoustic neuroma) Pressure in the ear (in fluid behind the eardrum) Ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus)"
5196,What causes Deafness?,"Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear.
The three tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) may not conduct sound properly. Or, the eardrum may not vibrate in response to sound.
Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. They include:
Buildup of wax in the ear canal Damage to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum Fluid that stays in the ear after an ear infection Foreign object that is stuck in the ear canal Hole in the eardrum Scar on the eardrum from repeat infections
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed.
Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by:
Acoustic neuroma Age-related hearing loss Childhood infections, such as meningitis, mumps, scarlet fever, and measles Meniere's disease Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation) Use of certain medicines
Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to:
Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures Genetic conditions (more than 400 are known) Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, or herpes)
The ear can also be injured by:
Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum, often from scuba diving Skull fractures (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear) Trauma from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones"
5197,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Deafness ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Hearing problems interfere with your lifestyle Hearing problems do not go away or become worse The hearing is worse in one ear than the other You have sudden, severe hearing loss or ringing in the ears (tinnitus) You have other symptoms, such as ear pain, along with hearing problems You have new headaches, weakness, or numbness anywhere on your body"
5198,What are the symptoms of Disequilibrium?,Patients with disequilibrium may experience one or more following symptoms.
5199,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Disequilibrium ?,See your doctor immediately if you experience disequilibrium with any of the following:
5200,What causes Dizziness?,"Light-headedness happens when there is not enough blood getting to the brain. This can happen if there is a sudden drop in your blood pressure or you are dehydrated from vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or other causes. Many people, especially as they get older, experience light-headedness if they get up too quickly from a lying or seated position. Light-headedness often accompanies the flu, hypoglycemia, common cold, or allergies.
More serious conditions that can lead to light-headedness include heart problems (such as abnormal heart rhythm or heart attack), stroke, and severe drop in blood pressure (shock). If any of these serious disorders is present, you will usually have additional symptoms like chest pain, a feeling of a racing heart, loss of speech, change in vision, or other symptoms.
The most common causes of vertigo are benign positional vertigo and labyrinthitis. Benign positional vertigo is vertigo that happens when you change the position of your head. Labyrinthitis usually follows a cold or flu and is caused by a viral infection of the inner ear. Meniere's disease is another common inner ear problem. It causes vertigo, loss of balance, and ringing in the ears.
Much less commonly, vertigo or feeling unsteady is a sign of stroke, multiple sclerosis, seizures, a brain tumor, or a bleed in your brain. In such conditions, other symptoms usually accompany the vertigo or imbalance."
5201,Who is at highest risk for Dizziness ?,"People with heart problems, stroke, multiple sclerosis, seizures, brain tumors, benign positional vertigo and labyrinthitis are likely to experience dizziness."
5202,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dizziness ?,"Call 911 or go to an emergency room if someone with dizziness also has:
A head injury Fever over 101°F, headache, or very stiff neck Convulsions or ongoing vomiting Chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, weakness, inability to move an arm or leg, or change in vision or speech Fainting and losing consciousness for more than a few minutes
Call your doctor if:
You have never had dizziness before. Symptoms you have had in the past are different (for example, last longer than usual, are worse than before, or are interfering with your daily activities). Medication is the suspected cause. Talk to your health care provider before making any changes to your medication. You have any hearing loss."
5203,What to expect if I have Dizziness  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most causes of dizziness are not serious and either quickly get better on their own or are easily treated.
5204,What are the symptoms of Dysarthria?,"Depending on its cause, dysarthria may develop slowly or occur suddenly.
People with dysarthria have trouble making certain sounds or words.
Their speech is poorly pronounced (such as slurring), and the rhythm or speed of their speech changes. Other symptoms include:
Sounding as though they are mumbling
Speaking softly or in a whisper
Speaking in a nasal or stuffy, hoarse, strained, or breathy voice
A person with dysarthria may also drool and have problems chewing or swallowing. It may be difficult to move the lips, tongue, or jaw."
5205,What causes Dysarthria?,"In a person with dysarthria, a nerve, brain, or muscle disorder makes it difficult to use or control the muscles of the mouth, tongue, larynx, or vocal cords, which make speech.
The muscles may be weak or completely paralyzed, or it may be difficult for the muscles to work together.
Dysarthria may be the result of brain damage due to:
Brain tumor
Dementia
Stroke
Traumatic brain injury
Dysarthria may result from damage to the nerves that supply the muscles that help you talk, or to the muscles themselves from:
Face or neck trauma
Surgery for head and neck cancer, such as partial or total removal of the tongue or voice box
Dysarthria may be caused by diseases that affect nerves and muscles (neuromuscular diseases):
Cerebral palsy
Multiple sclerosis
Muscular dystrophy
Myasthenia gravis
Parkinson's disease
Other causes may include:
Alcohol intoxication
Poorly fitting dentures
Side effects of medications that act on the central nervous system, such as narcotics, phenytoin, or carbamazepine"
5206,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dysarthria ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
Chest pain, chills, fever, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of pneumonia
Coughing or choking
Difficulty speaking to or communicating with other people
Feelings of sadness or depression"
5207,What to expect if I have Dysarthria  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Depending on the cause of dysarthria, symptoms may improve, stay the same, or get worse slowly or quickly.
Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) eventually lose the ability to speak.
Few people with Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis lose the ability to speak.
Dysarthria caused by medication or poorly fitting dentures can be reversed.
Dysarthria caused by a stroke or brain injury will not get worse, and may improve.
Dysarthria after surgery to the tongue or voice box should not get worse, and may improve with therapy. The severity of dysarthria depends on what type and how much tissue was removed."
5208,What are the symptoms of Dyslexia?,"A person with DRD may have trouble rhyming and separating sounds that make up spoken words. These abilities appear to be critical in the process of learning to read. A child's initial reading skills are based on word recognition, which involves being able to separate out the sounds in words and match them with letters and groups of letters.
Because people with DRD have difficulty connecting the sounds of language to the letters of words, they may have difficulty understanding sentences.
True dyslexia is much broader than simply confusing or transposing letters, for example mistaking ”b” and “d."".
In general, symptoms of DRD may include:
Difficulty determining the meaning (idea content) of a simple sentence
Difficulty learning to recognize written words
Difficulty rhyming
DRD may occur in combination with writing or math learning problems."
5209,What causes Dyslexia?,"Developmental reading disorder (DRD), or dyslexia, occurs when there is a problem in areas of the brain that help interpret language. It is not caused by vision problems. The disorder is a specific information processing problem that does not interfere with one's ability to think or to understand complex ideas. Most people with DRD have normal intelligence, and many have above-average intelligence.
DRD may appear in combination with developmental writing disorder and developmental arithmetic disorder. All of these involve using symbols to convey information. These conditions may appear alone or in any combination.
DRD often runs in families."
5210,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dyslexia ?,Call your health care provider if your child appears to be having trouble learning to read.
5211,What to expect if I have Dyslexia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Specialized help (called remedial instruction) can lead to marked improvement in reading and understanding.
Reading difficulties may persist for life."
5212,What are the symptoms of Epilepsy?,"Symptoms vary depending on the seizure types, from simple staring spells to loss of consciousness and violent convulsions. In most cases, the patient with epilepsy tends to have the same type of seizure each time.
Temporary confusion Staring spell Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Complete loss of consciousness"
5213,Who is at highest risk for Epilepsy ?,"Head injuries Stroke and other vascular diseases Brain tumors Brain infections, such as meningitis, encephalitis Brain poisoning, such as alcohol High fevers in childhood Dystocia when children were born A family history of epilepsy Male"
5214,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Epilepsy ?,"If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:
First seizure A longer seizure than before Frequently seizures Status epilepticus
Before the patient who's having a seizure is sent to the emergency department, the following measurements may be important and helpful.
Keep calm Don't hold the patient, place something soft under the patient's head. Take off any rigid articles from the patient, such as the glasses or backpack, and loosen any tight clothing near the neck. Stay with the patient, observe the event and be able to describe what happened before, during, and after the seizure to the coming ambulancemen."
5215,What to expect if I have Epilepsy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most patients with epilepsy survive outwardly normal lives. But some of them, especially children, may develop behavioral and emotional problems. They may be teased by classmates or avoided in school and other social setting. Patients with epilepsy have to face two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death."
5216,What are the symptoms of an Eyelid twitch?,"In addition to having repetitive, uncontrollable twitching or spasms of your eyelid (usually the upper lid), you may be very sensitive to light or have blurry vision."
5217,What causes an Eyelid twitch?,"The most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine. Once spasms begin, they may continue off and on for a few days. Then, they disappear. Most people experience this type of eyelid twitch on occasion and find it very annoying. In most cases, you won't even notice when the twitch has stopped.
More severe contractions, where the eyelid completely closes, are possible. These can be caused by irritation of the surface of the eye (cornea) or the membranes lining the eyelids (conjunctiva).
Sometimes, the reason your eyelid is twitching cannot be identified. This form of eyelid twitching lasts much longer, is often very uncomfortable, and can also cause your eyelids to close completely."
5218,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Eyelid twitch ?,"Call your primary care doctor or eye doctor (ophthalmologist, optometrist) if:
Eyelid twitching does not go away within 1 week Twitching completely closes your eyelid Twitching involves other parts of your face You have redness, swelling, or a discharge from your eye Your upper eyelid is drooping"
5219,What to expect if I have Eyelid twitch  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on the specific type or cause of eyelid twitch. In some cases, the twitches usually stop within a week."

The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the brain
The patient’s general health
Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
5224,What are the symptoms of Headache?,"There are two kinds of headache: primary headaches and second headaches. Primary headaches refer to headaches not associating with any stuctural problem in the head or neck, including migraine, tension, and cluster headaches, and a variety of other less common types of headache. Secondary headaches are those that are due to an underlying stuctural problem in the head or neck, such as brain tumor, stroke, or brain infection. Except for headache, secondary headaches include other symptoms caused by the diseases.
Symptoms in primary headaches include:
Some headaches onset without aura. Certain food, emotion changes or environmental chages may be the auras for other headaches. A pain that begins in the back of the head and upper neck, as a tightness or pressure. The pain is usually mild and bilateral Not accompanied with nausea or vomiting Usually occur sporadically No function damage
Symptoms in secondary headaches depend on the underlying cause. Except for headache, there may be other symptoms such as the following.
Headache may be continuing. Fever Hemiplegia Nausea and vomiting Diplopia Anepia"
5225,Who is at highest risk for Headache ?,"Brain tumors Brain infection Intracranial hypertension Anxiety Arthritis in neck or spine Degenerative bone or disk disease in the neck or spine Depression Temporomandibular joint disorders Drugs, such as nitrates Alcohol Environmental changes, such as changes in barometric pressure and altitude, inclement weather, or high winds."
5226,What causes Headache?,"Headache is a kind of symptom, the most important thing is to make the underlying causes clear.
Meidcal history, the characteristics of the patient's headache. Physical examination and neurological evaluation. Eye examination: It is very useful to identify underlying problem in the brain. Blood tests: Blood tests include complete blood count, liver, and kidney function tests. The results of the various lab tests may provide clues to detect some secondary headaches that can cause coma. Head imaging studies such as CT and MRI: These images can be used to detect the structural problems in the brain. Electroencephalography (EEG): This test can demonstrate the electrical activity in the brain and be helpful for the diagnosis."
5227,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Headache ?,"Headache is just a symptom. It is necessary to indentify the underlying causes. So, go to see your doctor when you show this symptom. If you feel the following symptoms, go to the emergency department as soon as possible.
Sudden sever headache sudden headache associated with a stiff neck Headache accompanying with nausea or vomiting Headache accompanying with fever, convulsions, or confusion or loss of consciousness Headache accompanying with pain in the eye or ear Headaches following trauma to the head Persistent headache in a person who was previously headache free Recurring headache in children"

Underlying causes"
5229,What are the symptoms of Horner's syndrome?,"Decreased sweating on the affected side of the face Drooping eyelid (ptosis) Sinking of the eyeball into the face Small (constricted) pupil (the black part in the center of the eye)
There may also be symptoms of the disorder that is causing the problem."
5230,What causes Horner's syndrome?,"Horner's syndrome can be caused by any interruption in a set of nerve fibers that start in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus and run to the face.
Sympathetic nerve fiber injuries can result from:
Injury to one of the main arteries to the brain (carotid artery) Injury to nerves in the neck called the brachial plexus Migraine or cluster headaches Stroke, tumor, or other damage to a part of the brain called the brainstem Tumor in the top of the lung
Rarely, Horner's syndrome may be present at birth (congenital). The condition may occur with a lack of color (pigmentation) of the iris (colored part of the eye)."
5231,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Horner%27s syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of Horner's syndrome.
5232,What to expect if I have Horner%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on whether treatment of the cause is successful.
5233,What are the symptoms of Hypersomnia?,"Symptoms often develop slowly during adolescence or young adulthood. They include:
Daytime naps that do not relieve drowsiness Difficulty waking from a long sleep may feel confused or disoriented Increased need for sleep during the day even while at work, or during a meal or conversation Increased sleep time up to 14 - 18 hours per day
Other symptoms may include anxiety, feeling irritated, low energy, restlessness, slow thinking or speech, loss of appetite, and memory difficulty.
Cataplexy: suddenly falling asleep or losing muscle control which is part of narcolepsy, is NOT a symptom of idiopathic hypersomnia."
5234,What causes Hypersomnia?,"The usual approach is to consider other potential causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.
Other sleep disorders that may cause daytime sleepiness include:

Fatigue is a common and bothersome symptom as MS progresses. It is often worse in the late afternoon."
5236,What are the causes of Multiple sclerosis ?,"MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop. The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur in any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord.
It is unknown what exactly causes MS. The most common thought is that a virus or gene defect, or both, are to blame. Environmental factors may also play a role.
You are slightly more likely to develop this condition if you have a family history of MS or you live in a part of the world where MS is more common."
5237,Who is at highest risk for Multiple sclerosis ?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects women more than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 and 40 but can be seen at any age.
Environmental factors, such as smoking and decreased light exposure have been shown to increase the risk of MS, while other factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have had inconclusive results.
Lastly, many different microbes have been proposed as potential triggers of MS, but none have been substantiated."
5238,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Multiple sclerosis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You develop any symptoms of MS Symptoms get worse, even with treatment The condition deteriorates to the point where home care is no longer possible"
5239,What to expect if I have Multiple sclerosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies and is hard to predict. Although the disorder is chronic and incurable, life expectancy can be normal or almost normal. Most people with MS continue to walk and function at work with minimal disability for 20 or more years.
The following typically have the best outlook:
Females People who were young (less than 30 years) when the disease started People with infrequent attacks People with a relapsing-remitting pattern People who have limited disease on imaging studies
The amount of disability and discomfort depends on:
How often you have attacks How severe they are The part of the central nervous system that is affected by each attack
Most people return to normal or near-normal function between attacks. Slowly, there is a greater loss of function with less improvement between attacks. Over time, many require a wheelchair to get around and have a more difficult time transferring out of the wheelchair.
Those with a support system are often able to remain in their home."
5240,What are the symptoms of Photophobia ?,Blurred vision Changes in hearing Dizziness Headache Itching Nausea Neck stiffness Numbness or tingling elsewhere in the body Pain in the eye Redness Sore or wound in eye Swelling
5241,What are the causes of Photophobia ?,"Acute iritis or uveitis (inflammation inside eye) Burns to the eye Corneal abrasion Corneal ulcer Drugs such as amphetamines, atropine, cocaine, cyclopentolate, idoxuridine, phenylephrine, scopolamine, trifluridine, tropicamide, and vidarabine Excessive wearing of contact lenses, or wearing badly fitted contact lenses Eye disease, injury, or infection (such as chalazion, episcleritis, glaucoma) Eye testing when the eyes have been dilated Meningitis Migraine headache"
5242,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Photophobia ?,"If eye pain is severe, see your health care provider to determine the cause of light sensitivity. Proper treatment may cure the problem. Seek urgent medical attention if your pain is moderate to severe, even in low-light conditions.
Call your doctor if light sensitivity is severe or painful -- for example, if you need to wear sunglasses indoors.
Also call if the sensitivity occurs with headaches, red eye or blurred vision or does not go away in a day or two."
5243,What are the symptoms of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy?,"Headaches Loss of coordination, clumsiness Loss of language ability (aphasia) Memory loss Vision problems Weakness of the legs and arms that gets worse"
5244,What causes Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy?,"The JC virus (JCV) causes PML. By age 10, most people have been infected with this virus, but it hardly ever causes symptoms."
5245,Who is at highest risk for Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ?,"Anyone with a weakened immune system, however, are at greater risk of developing PML. Causes of a weakened immune system include:
AIDS (less common now because of better AIDS treatments) Certain medications used to treat multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and related conditions Leukemia and lymphoma"
5246,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ?,"When you experience above mentioned symptoms, consult your doctor immediately."
5247,What to expect if I have Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,PML is a life-threatening condition. Talk to your doctor about care decisions.
5248,What are the symptoms of Restless legs syndrome?,"RLS leads to sensations in the lower legs that make you uncomfortable unless you move your legs. These sensations:
Usually occur at night when you lie down, or sometimes during the day when you sit for long periods of time May be described as aching, bubbling, crawling, creeping, pulling, searing, or tingling May last for 1 hour or longer Sometimes also occur in the upper leg, feet, or arms
You will feel an irresistible urge to walk or move your legs, which almost always relieves the discomfort.
Most patients have rhythmic leg movements during sleep hours, called periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD).
All of these symptoms often disturb sleep. Symptoms can make it difficult to sit during air or car travel, or through classes or meetings.
Note: Symptoms may be worse during stress or emotional upset."
5249,What causes Restless legs syndrome?,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults. Stress makes it worse. The cause is not known in most patients.
RLS may occur more often in patients with:
Peripheral neuropathy Chronic kidney disease Parkinson's disease Pregnancy Iron deficiency Use of certain medications
A form of RLS may be passed down in families. This may be a factor when symptoms start at a younger age. The abnormal gene has not yet been identified.
Restless legs syndrome can result in a decreased quality of sleep (insomnia). This lack of sleep can lead to daytime sleepiness, anxiety or depression, and confusion or slowed thought processes."
5250,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Restless legs syndrome ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of restless legs syndrome Your sleep is disrupted"
5251,What to expect if I have Restless legs syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Restless legs syndrome is not dangerous or life-threatening, and it is not a sign of a serious disorder. However, it can be uncomfortable and disrupt your sleep."
5252,How should this medicine be used?,"Rivastigmine comes as a capsule and solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day with meals in the morning and evening. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rivastigmine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor will start you on a low dose of rivastigmine and slowly increase your dose, not more than once every 2 weeks.
Rivastigmine may improve the ability to think and remember or slow the loss of these abilities, but does not cure Alzheimer's disease or dementia in people with Parkinson's disease. Continue to take rivastigmine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rivastigmine without talking to your doctor.
If you are taking rivastigmine oral solution, ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's instructions for use. Carefully read these instructions. Always use the oral dosing syringe that comes with rivastigmine solution to measure your dose. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about how to measure your dose of rivastigmine solution.
Rivastigmine oral solution may be swallowed directly from the syringe or mixed with a liquid before use. Mix it with a small glass of water, cold fruit juice, or soda. Be sure to stir the mixture completely. Do not mix this medication with any liquid other than the ones listed. If the medication is mixed with water, juice, or soda, it must be taken within 4 hours.
To take a dose of rivastigmine solution, follow these steps:
Remove the oral dosing syringe that came with this medication from its protective case. Push down and twist off the child-resistant cap to open the bottle of rivastigmine solution. Put the tip of the oral syringe into the white stopper opening on top of the bottle. While holding the syringe straight up, pull up on the plunger to the mark on the syringe that equals your dose. Check the liquid in the syringe for air bubbles. If there are large air bubbles, gently move the syringe plunger up and down a few times. Do not worry about a few tiny air bubbles. Make sure the plunger is on the mark on the syringe that equals your dose. Remove the oral syringe from the bottle by pulling up on it. Swallow your dose from the syringe directly, or mix it with the liquid you have chosen. Drink or swallow all of the solution. Wipe off the outside of the oral syringe with a clean tissue, and put the syringe back into its case. Close the child-resistant cap on the bottle of medication."
5253,What special precautions should I follow?,"Before taking rivastigmine:
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to rivastigmine, neostigmine (Prostigmin), physostigmine (Antilirium, Isopto Eserine), pyridostigmine (Mestinon, Regonol), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in rivastigmine solution. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.. tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antihistamines; aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); bethanechol (Duvoid, Urabeth, Urecholine); ipratropium (Atrovent); and medications for Alzheimer's disease, glaucoma, irritable bowel disease, motion sickness, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's disease, ulcers, or urinary problems. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma, an enlarged prostate or other condition that blocks the flow of urine, ulcers, abnormal heart beats, or other heartor lung disease. tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking rivastigmine, call your doctor. if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking rivastigmine."
5254,What special dietary instructions should I follow?,"Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet."
5255,What should I do if I forget a dose?,"Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
If you miss taking rivastigmine for more than a few days, talk to your doctor before starting to take it again. You will probably have to restart taking it at a lower dose."
5256,What storage conditions are needed for this medicine?,"Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store rivastigmine solution in an upright position.

Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication."
5257,What other information should I know?,"Keep all appointments with your doctor.
Do not let anyone else take your medication.Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription."
5258,What are the symptoms of Sciatica ?,"Sciatica pain can vary widely. It may feel like a mild tingling, dull ache, or a burning sensation. In some cases, the pain is severe enough to make a person unable to move.
The pain most often occurs on one side. Some people have sharp pain in one part of the leg or hip and numbness in other parts. The sensations may also be felt on the back of the calf or on the sole of the foot. The affected leg may feel weak.
The pain often starts slowly. Sciatica pain may get worse:
After standing or sitting At night When sneezing, coughing, or laughing When bending backwards or walking more than a few yards, especially if caused by spinal stenosis"
5259,What are the causes of Sciatica ?,"Sciatica occurs when there is pressure or damage to the sciatic nerve. This nerve starts in the spine and runs down the back of each leg. This nerve controls the muscles of the back of the knee and lower leg and provides sensation to the back of the thigh, part of the lower leg, and the sole of the foot.
Common causes of sciatica include:
Piriformis syndrome (a pain disorder involving the narrow piriformis muscle in the buttocks) Slipped disk Degenerative disk disease Spinal stenosis Pelvic injury or fracture Tumors"
5260,Who is at highest risk for Sciatica ?,"Risk factors for Sciatica include:
Diabetes Inactivity and sedentary lifestyles Increasing Age Manual Labor that requires strenuous use of your back and/or heavy lifting"
5261,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sciatica ?,"Call your doctor right away if you have:
Unexplained fever with back pain Back pain after a severe blow or fall Redness or swelling on the back or spine Pain traveling down your legs below the knee Weakness or numbness in your buttocks, thigh, leg, or pelvis Burning with urination or blood in your urine Pain that is worse when you lie down, or awakens you at night Severe pain and you cannot get comfortable Loss of control of urine or stool (incontinence)
Also call if:
You have been losing weight unintentionally You use steroids or intravenous drugs You have had back pain before but this episode is different and feels worse This episode of back pain has lasted longer than 4 weeks
If any of these symptoms are present, your doctor will carefully check for any sign of infection (such as meningitis, abscess, or urinary tract infection), ruptured disk, spinal stenosis, hernia, cancer, kidney stone, twisted testicle, or other serious problem."
5262,What to expect if I have Sciatica  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If the cause of the sciatic nerve dysfunction can be identified and successfully treated, full recovery is possible. The extent of disability varies from no disability to partial or complete loss of movement or sensation. Nerve pain may be severe and persist for a prolonged period of time."
5263,What are the symptoms of Shaken baby syndrome?,"The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. They may include:
Convulsions (seizures) Decreased alertness Extreme irritability or other changes in behavior Lethargy, sleepiness, not smiling Loss of consciousness Loss of vision No breathing Pale or bluish skin Poor feeding, lack of appetite Vomiting
There may not be any physical signs of injury, such as bruising, bleeding, or swelling. In some cases, the condition can be difficult to diagnose and may not be identified during an office visit. However, rib fractures are common and can be seen on x-ray.
An eye doctor may find bleeding behind the baby's eye or retinal detachment. There are, however, other causes of bleeding behind the eye and they should be ruled out before diagnosing shaken baby syndrome. Other factors must be considered."
5264,What causes Shaken baby syndrome?,"In most cases, an angry parent or caregiver shakes the baby to punish or quiet the child. Such shaking usually takes place when the infant is crying inconsolably and the frustrated caregiver loses control. Many times the caregiver did not intend to harm the baby. Still, it is a form of child abuse.
Injuries are most likely to happen when the baby is shaken and then the baby's head hits something. Even hitting a soft object, such as a mattress or pillow, may be enough to injure newborns and small infants. Children's brains are softer, their neck muscles and ligaments are weak, and their heads are large and heavy in proportion to their bodies. The result is a type of whiplash, similar to what occurs in some auto accidents.
Shaken baby syndrome does not result from gentle bouncing, playful swinging or tossing the child in the air, or jogging with the child. It also is very unlikely to occur from accidents such as falling off chairs or down stairs, or accidentally being dropped from a caregiver's arms. Short falls may cause other types of head injuries, although these are often minor."
5265,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Shaken baby syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if a child has any of the above signs or symptoms, regardless of how severe they are. Also call if you think a child has shaken baby syndrome.
If you think a child is in immediate danger because of abuse or neglect, you should call 911.
If you suspect that a child is being abused, report it immediately. Most states have a child abuse hotline. You may also use Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline (1-800-4-A-Child)."
5266,What are the symptoms of Somnolence?,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (without a known cause) suggests that you have a significant sleep disorder. It is different from fatigue.
Depression, anxiety, stress, and boredom can all contribute to excessive sleepiness, but these conditions more typically cause fatigue and apathy."
5267,What causes Somnolence?,"Having to work long hours or different shifts (nights, weekends) Medications (tranquilizers, sleeping pills, antihistamines) Medical conditions (such as hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hyponatremia / hypernatremia) Not sleeping for long enough Sleep disorders (such as sleep apnea syndrome and narcolepsy)"
5268,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Somnolence ?,Contact your health care provider if you think the cause of your drowsiness is from any of the above conditions.
5269,What are the symptoms of Spinal cord injury?,"Symptoms vary somewhat depending on the location of the injury. Spinal cord injury causes weakness and sensory loss at and below the point of the injury. The severity of symptoms depends on whether the entire cord is severely injured (complete) or only partially injured (incomplete).
The spinal cord doesn't go below the 1st lumbar vertebra, so injuries at and below this level do not cause spinal cord injury. However, they may cause cauda equina syndrome -- injury to the nerve roots in this area.
When spinal cord injuries occur in the neck area, symptoms can affect the arms, legs, and middle of the body. The symptoms may occur on one or both sides of the body. Symptoms can include:
Breathing difficulties (from paralysis of the breathing muscles, if the injury is high up in the neck) Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms) Numbness Sensory changes Spasticity (increased muscle tone) Pain Weakness, paralysis
When spinal injuries occur at chest level, symptoms can affect the legs:
Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms) Numbness Sensory changes Spasticity (increased muscle tone) Pain Weakness, paralysis
Injuries to the cervical or high thoracic spinal cord may also result in blood pressure problems, abnormal sweating, and trouble maintaining normal body temperature.
When spinal injuries occur at the lower back level, varying degrees of symptoms can affect one or both legs, as well as the muscles that control your bowels and bladder:
Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (you may have constipation, leakage, and bladder spasms) Numbness Pain Sensory changes Spasticity (increased muscle tone) Weakness and paralysis"
5270,What causes Spinal cord injury?,"Spinal cord trauma can be caused by any number of injuries to the spine. They can result from motor vehicle accidents, falls, sports injuries (particularly diving into shallow water), industrial accidents, gunshot wounds, assault, and other causes.
A minor injury can cause spinal cord trauma if the spine is weakened (such as from rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis) or if the spinal canal protecting the spinal cord has become too narrow (spinal stenosis) due to the normal aging process.
Direct injury, such as cuts, can occur to the spinal cord, particularly if the bones or the disks have been damaged. Fragments of bone (for example, from broken vertebrae, which are the spine bones) or fragments of metal (such as from a traffic accident or gunshot) can cut or damage the spinal cord.
Direct damage can also occur if the spinal cord is pulled, pressed sideways, or compressed. This may occur if the head, neck, or back are twisted abnormally during an accident or injury.
Bleeding, fluid accumulation, and swelling can occur inside the spinal cord or outside the spinal cord (but within the spinal canal). The accumulation of blood or fluid can compress the spinal cord and damage it.
Most spinal cord trauma happens to young, healthy individuals. Men ages 15 - 35 are most commonly affected. The death rate tends to be higher in young children with spinal injuries."
5271,Who is at highest risk for Spinal cord injury ?,"Risk factors include participating in risky physical activities, not wearing protective gear during work or play, or diving into shallow water.
Older people with weakened spines (from osteoporosis) may be more likely to have a spinal cord injury. Patients who have other medical problems that make them prone to falling from weakness or clumsiness (from stroke, for example) may also be more susceptible."
5272,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Spinal cord injury ?,"Call your health care provider if injury to the back or neck occurs. Call 911 if there is any loss of movement or sensation. This is a medical emergency!
Management of spinal cord injury begins at the site of an accident with paramedics trained in immobilizing the injured spine to prevent further damage to the nervous system.
Someone suspected of having a spinal cord injury should NOT be moved without immobilization unless there is an immediate threat."
5273,What to expect if I have Spinal cord injury  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Paralysis and loss of sensation of part of the body are common. This includes total paralysis or numbness and varying degrees of movement or sensation loss. Death is possible, particularly if there is paralysis of the breathing muscles.
How well a person does depends on the level of injury. Injuries near the top of the spine result in more extensive disability than do injuries low in the spine.
Recovery of some movement or sensation within 1 week usually means the person has a good chance of recovering more function, although this may take 6 months or more. Losses that remain after 6 months are more likely to be permanent.
Routine bowel care frequently takes one hour or more on a daily basis.
A majority of people with spinal cord injury must perform bladder catheterization from time to time.
Modifications of the person's living environment are usually required.
Most people with spinal cord injury are wheelchair- or bed-bound, or have impaired mobility requiring a variety of assistive devices."
5274,What are the symptoms of Syringomyelia?,"Gradual loss of muscle mass (wasting, atrophy) Headache Muscle function loss, loss of ability to use arms or legs Numbness or decreased sensation Decreased sense of pain or temperature Lessened ability to sense that the skin is being touched Neck, shoulders, upper arms, trunk -- in a cape-like pattern Slowly, but progressively, gets worse Pain down the arms, neck, or into the upper back Weakness (decreased muscle strength, independent of exercise) in the arms or legs
Additional symptoms that may be associated with this disease:
Muscle contractions Rashes Spasms in or tightness of the leg muscles Uncoordinated movement"
5275,What causes Syringomyelia?,"The fluid buildup seen in syringomyelia may be a result of spinal cord trauma, tumors of the spinal cord, or birth defects (specifically, "" chiari malformation,"" in which part of the brain pushes down onto the spinal cord at the base of the skull).
The fluid-filled cavity usually begins in the neck area. It expands slowly, putting pressure on the spinal cord and slowly causing damage."
5276,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Syringomyelia ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of syringomyelia.
5277,What to expect if I have Syringomyelia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Untreated, the disorder gets worse very slowly, but it eventually causes severe disability. Surgical decompression usually stops the progression of the disorder, with about 50% of people showing significant improvement in neurologic function after surgical decompression."
5278,What are the symptoms of Tabes dorsalis?,Lightning pains  Impaired sensation and proprioception  Hypesthesias  Progressive sensory ataxia (inability to feel the lower limbs)  Diminished reflexes or loss of reflexes  Poor coordination or loss of coordination  Unsteady gait (locomotor ataxia)  Sexual function problems
5279,What causes Tabes dorsalis?,"Tabes dorsalis is a form of neurosyphilis, which is a complication of late or tertiary syphilis infection. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infectious disease. The infection damages the spinal cord and peripheral nervous tissue."
5280,What to expect if I have Tabes dorsalis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Progressive disability is possible if the disorder is left untreated.
5281,What are the symptoms of Tardive dyskinesia?,Facial grimacing Jaw swinging Repetitive chewing Tongue thrusting
5282,What causes Tardive dyskinesia?,"Tardive dyskinesia is a serious side effect that occurs when you take medications called neuroleptics. It occurs most frequently when the medications are taken for a long time, but in some cases it can also occur after you take them for a short amount of time.
The drugs that most commonly cause this disorder are older antipsychotic drugs, including:
Haloperidol
Fluphenazine
Trifluoperazine
Other drugs, similar to antipsychotic drugs, that can cause tardive dyskinesia include:
Cinnarizine
Flunarizine (Sibelium)
Metoclopramide"
5283,Who is at highest risk for Tardive dyskinesia ?,People taking medications called neuroleptics are at risk for tardive dyskinesia. Examples of these medications are listed above.
5284,What to expect if I have Tardive dyskinesia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If diagnosed early, the condition may be reversed by stopping the drug that caused the symptoms. Even if the antipsychotic drugs are stopped, the involuntary movements may become permanent and in some cases may become significantly worse."
5285,What are the symptoms of Trigeminal neuralgia?,"Very painful, sharp electric-like spasms that usually last a few seconds or minutes, but can become constant Pain is usually only on one side of the face, often around the eye, cheek, and lower part of the face Pain may be triggered by touch or sounds Painful attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by common, everyday activities, such as:
Brushing teeth Chewing Drinking Eating Lightly touching the face Shaving"
5286,What causes Trigeminal neuralgia?,"The pain of trigeminal neuralgia comes from the trigeminal nerve. This nerve carries the feelings of touch and pain from the face, eyes, sinuses, and mouth to the brain.
Trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by:
Multiple sclerosis Pressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel or tumor
Often, no cause is found. Doctors are more likely to find a cause in a person who is younger than age 40."
5287,Who is at highest risk for Trigeminal neuralgia ?,"The condition usually affects adults, but it may affect anyone at any age. Trigeminal neuralgia may be part of the normal aging process."
5288,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Trigeminal neuralgia ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia.
5289,What to expect if I have Trigeminal neuralgia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well you do depends on the cause of the problem. If there is no disease causing the problem, treatment can provide at least some relief.
However, the pain may become constant and severe in some patients."
5290,What are the symptoms of Tuberous sclerosis ?,"Skin symptoms include:
Areas of the skin that are white (due to decreased pigment) and have either an ash leaf or confetti appearance Red patches on the face containing many blood vessels (adenoma sebaceum) Raised patches of skin with an orange-peel texture (shagreen spots), often on the back
Brain symptoms include:
Developmental delays Mental retardation Seizures
Other symptoms:
Pitted tooth enamel Rough growths under or around the fingernails and toenails Rubbery noncancerous tumors on or around the tongue
The symptoms of tuberous sclerosis vary from person to person. Some people have normal intelligence and no seizures. Others have intellectual disabilities or difficult-to-control seizures."
5291,What causes Tuberous sclerosis ?,"Tuberous sclerosis is inherited. Changes (mutations) in two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, are responsible for most cases of the condition.
Only one parent needs to pass on the mutation for the child to get the disease. However, most cases are due to new mutations, so there usually is no family history of tuberous sclerosis.
This condition is one of a group of diseases called neurocutaneous syndromes . Both the skin and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) are involved.
There are no known risk factors, other than having a parent with tuberous sclerosis. In that case, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease."
5292,When to Contact a Medical Professional ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Either side of your family has a history of tuberous sclerosis You notice symptoms of tuberous sclerosis in your child
Call a genetic specialist if your child is diagnosed with cardiac rhabdomyoma. Tuberous sclerosis is the leading cause of this tumor."
5293,What to expect if I have Tuberous sclerosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Children with mild tuberous sclerosis usually do well. However, children with severe retardation or uncontrollable seizures usually do poorly. Occasionally when a severely affected child is born, the parents are examined, and one of them is found to have had a mild case of tuberous sclerosis that was not diagnosed.
The tumors in this disease tend to be noncancerous (benign). However, some tumors (such as kidney or brain tumors) can become cancerous."
5294,What are the symptoms of Vertigo?,"Patients with vertigo may experience one or more following symptons.
A sensation of disorientation or motion or the perception that surrounding objects are moving or spinning Lightheadedness Imbalance Nausea and vomiting Sweat Abnormal eye movements Tinnitus or hearing loss"
5295,What causes Vertigo?,Upper respiratory tract infection Ear infection Labyrinthitis Head or ear injury Multiple sclerosis Epilepsy Neck injuries Migraine Ménière's disease Acoustic neuroma Brain stem tumors Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
5296,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Vertigo ?,"See your doctor immediately if you experience vertigo with any of the following:
A new, different or severe headache Fever Diplopia or loss of vision Hearing loss Trouble in speaking Leg or arm weakness or paralysis, especially in one side Loss of consciousness Difficulty walking Numbness"
5297,What to expect if I have Vertigo  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of vertigo depends on the causes. Outcomes of vertigo caused by tumors are poorer than any other causes.
5298,How does the balance system work?,"Movement of fluid in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the direction and speed of rotation of the head--for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs that are part of the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.
The balance system works with the visual and skeletal systems (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. For example, visual signals are sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings. These signals are processed by the brain, and compared to information from the vestibular and the skeletal systems. An example of interaction between the visual and vestibular systems is called the vestibular-ocular reflex. The nystagmus (an involuntary rhythmic eye movement) that occurs when a person is spun around and then suddenly stops is an example of a vestibular-ocular reflex."
5299,What are the symptoms of a balance disorder?,"When balance is impaired, an individual has difficulty maintaining orientation. For example, an individual may experience the ""room spinning"" and may not be able to walk without staggering, or may not even be able to arise. Some of the symptoms a person with a balance disorder may experience are:
A sensation of dizziness or vertigo (spinning). Falling or a feeling of falling. Lightheadedness or feeling woozy. Visual blurring. Disorientation.
Some individuals may also experience nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, faintness, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, fear, anxiety, or panic. Some reactions to the symptoms are fatigue, depression, and decreased concentration. The symptoms may appear and disappear over short time periods or may last for a longer period of time."
5300,What causes a balance disorder?,"Infections (viral or bacterial), head injury, disorders of blood circulation affecting the inner ear or brain, certain medications, and aging may change our balance system and result in a balance problem. Individuals who have illnesses, brain disorders, or injuries of the visual or skeletal systems, such as eye muscle imbalance and arthritis, may also experience balance difficulties. A conflict of signals to the brain about the sensation of movement can cause motion sickness (for instance, when an individual tries to read while riding in a car). Some symptoms of motion sickness are dizziness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and generalized discomfort. Balance disorders can be due to problems in any of four areas:
Peripheral vestibular disorder, a disturbance in the labyrinth. Central vestibular disorder, a problem in the brain or its connecting nerves. Systemic disorder, a problem of the body other than the head and brain. Vascular disorder, or blood flow problems."
5301,What are some types of balance disorders?,"Some of the more common balance disorders are:
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV): a brief, intense sensation of vertigo that occurs because of a specific positional change of the head. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right upon getting out of bed in the morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is not known, although it may be caused by an inner ear infection, head injury, or aging.
Labyrinthitis: an infection or inflammation of the inner ear causing dizziness and loss of balance.
Ménière's disease: an inner ear fluid balance disorder that causes episodes of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus (a ringing or roaring in the ears), and the sensation of fullness in the ear. The cause of Ménière's disease is unknown.
Vestibular neuronitis: an infection of the vestibular nerve, generally viral.
Perilymph fistula: a leakage of inner ear fluid to the middle ear. It can occur after head injury, physical exertion or, rarely, without a known cause."
5302,How are balance disorders diagnosed?,"Diagnosis of a balance disorder is complicated because there are many kinds of balance disorders and because other medical conditions--including ear infections, blood pressure changes, and some vision problems--and some medications may contribute to a balance disorder. A person experiencing dizziness should see a physician for an evaluation.
The primary physician may request the opinion of an otolaryngologist to help evaluate a balance problem. An otolaryngologist is a physician/surgeon who specializes in diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck, with expertise in balance disorders. He or she will usually obtain a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination to start to sort out possible causes of the balance disorder. The physician may require tests to assess the cause and extent of the disruption of balance. The kinds of tests needed will vary based on the patient's symptoms and health status. Because there are so many variables, not all patients will require every test.
Some examples of diagnostic tests the otolaryngologist may request are a hearing examination, blood tests, an electronystagmogram (ENG--a test of the vestibular system), or imaging studies of the head and brain.
The caloric test may be performed as part of the ENG. In this test, each ear is flushed with warm and then cool water, usually one ear at a time; the amount of nystagmus resulting is measured. Weak nystagmus or the absence of nystagmus may indicate an inner ear disorder.
Another test of the vestibular system, posturography, requires the individual to stand on a special platform capable of movement within a controlled visual environment; body sway is recorded in response to movement of the platform and/or the visual environment."
5303,How are balance disorders treated?,"There are various options for treating balance disorders. One option includes treatment for a disease or disorder that may be contributing to the balance problem, such as ear infection, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Individual treatment will vary and will be based upon symptoms, medical history, general health, examination by a physician, and the results of medical tests.
Another treatment option includes balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation). The exercises include movements of the head and body specifically developed for the patient. This form of therapy is thought to promote compensation for the disorder. Vestibular retraining programs are administered by professionals with knowledge and understanding of the vestibular system and its relationship with other systems in the body.
For people diagnosed with Ménière's disease, dietary changes such as reducing intake of sodium may help. For some people, reducing alcohol, caffeine, and/or avoiding nicotine may be helpful. Some aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin and streptomycin, are used to treat Ménière's disease. Systemic streptomycin (given by injection) and topical gentamicin (given directly to the inner ear) are useful for their ability to affect the hair cells of the balance system. Gentamicin also can affect the hair cells of the cochlea, though, and cause hearing loss. In cases that do not respond to medical management, surgery may be indicated.
A program of talk therapy and/or physical rehabilitation may be recommended for people with anxiety.

5304,What are the symptoms of Bone cancer (Osteosarcoma)?,"Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, and may have been occurring for some time. If the tumour is large, it can appear as a swelling. The affected bone is not as strong as normal bones and may fracture with minor trauma (a pathological fracture).
Bone fracture (may occur after what seems like a routine movement) Bone pain Limitation of motion Limping (if the tumor is in the leg) Pain when lifting (if the tumor is in the arm) Tenderness, swelling, or redness at the site of the tumor"
5305,Who is at highest risk for Bone or cartilage mass ?,"Age and height: Data suggest that the risk of osteosarcoma is highest during the teenage ""growth spurt."" Children with osteosarcoma are usually tall for their age. Radiation to bones: People who were treated with radiation for another cancer have a higher risk of later developing post-radiation (after radiation) osteosarcoma. Certain bone diseases: Some bone diseases such as Paget disease of bone and multiple hereditary osteochondromas may be risk factors of osteosarcoma. Inherited cancer syndromes: Syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and retinoblastoma may increase the risk of developing osteosarcoma."
5306,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bone or cartilage mass ?,Speak to your doctor immediately if you are experiencing any of the above mentioned symptoms.
5307,What to expect if I have Bone or cartilage mass  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis for bone cancer varies immensely based on how far the cancer has spread in the body and what specific type of cancer it is. You should talk to your doctor about your specific condition and outlook to gain a better sense of your prognosis.
5308,What is desmoid tumor?,"Desmoid tumor s grow from the connective tissue in your body They grow from fibroblast cells, which make up connective tissue and are also important for wound healing Connective tissue supports and connects your bones, ligaments, and muscles, and helps hold your organs in place Desmoid tumor s are also known as aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid -type fibromatosis A desmoid tumor can occur anywhere in the body since connective tissue is found everywhere in your body Desmoid tumor s are often found in the abdomen They can also be found in the shoulders, upper arm s, and thighs Desmoid tumor s are benign, which means they are not cancer While the cells of the desmoid tumor do not travel to parts the body like cancer can, they can invade nearby tissue and are often very painful Desmoid tumor s can grow slowly or very quickly The quicker they grow the more serious they are Desmoid tumor s can be difficult to completely remove with surgery Desmoid tumor s are most common in people between the ages of 15 and 60 years They are more common in females than males"
5309,How common is desmoid tumor?,"Out of one million people worldwide, two to four are diagnosed with a desmoid tumor per year"
5310,How is desmoid tumor diagnosed?,"Some people with desmoid tumor s have symptoms, but others don’t Symptoms can include: Pain Swelling in the area of the tumor Sleep loss Difficulty moving For people without symptoms, these tumors can be discovered if the person has an imaging test for another reason"
5311,How is desmoid tumor treated?,"Treatment for each patient will be unique You should go to an expert in sarcoma treatment to decide the best approach for your tumor You can contact MyPART for help finding experts near you Desmoid tumor s can be hard to predict They can shrink and go away on their own, they can remain the same size, or they can grow quickly Treatment options to discuss with your doctor include: Watch and wait In some cases, the tumor grows very slowly, or even shrinks without any treatment In this case it may be safest for your doctor to check your tumor regularly without treating it Surgery Surgery has been a standard treatment for desmoid tumor s in the past, but this may be changing Because the tumor often returns to the same location after surgery, doctors are looking for other treatment options Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a treatment option for some desmoid tumor s Because radiation therapy can cause other cancers in the future, it is important to discuss with your doctor Chemotherapy There is no standard chemotherapy for desmoid tumor s But, promising new drugs have been shown to shrink these tumors It is important to discuss these different options with your doctor and seek second opinions if possible"
5312,Do desmoid tumors run in families?,"In 5% to 10% of cases, desmoid tumor s may run in families Gardner syndrome is a rare syndrome that runs in families People with this syndrome have a high risk of colorectal cancer and desmoid tumor"
5313,How does desmoid tumor form?,"Scientists are always working to understand how tumors form, but it can be hard to prove We know that some people with a family history of desmoid tumor s have a change in a gene called adenomatous polyposis coli, or APC This change causes too much of a protein called beta-catenin in parts of your cells Too much beta-catenin can cause cells to grow when they shouldn’t In some desmoid tumor s, there is too much beta-catenin, even though APC is normal APC and beta-catenin are important in many common cancers, such as colon cancer, and scientists are trying to use this information to develop better cancer treatments, which will help people with desmoid tumor s"
5314,What is the prognosis for someone with a desmoid tumor?,"The estimate of how a disease will affect you long-term is called prognosis Every person is different and prognosis will depend on many factors, such as: Where the tumor is in your body How fast the tumor grows How much of the tumor was taken out during surgery If you want information on your prognosis, it is important to talk to your doctor NCI also has resources to help you understand cancer prognosis Doctors estimate desmoid tumor survival rates by how groups of people with desmoid tumor s have done in the past Because there are so few desmoid tumor patients these rates may not be very accurate They also don’t take into account newer treatments being developed Most desmoid tumor s don’t change how long you will live, but they are very difficult to get rid of and can be painful to live with Desmoid tumor s growing in the abdomen can cause problems, such as blocking your intestines It is important that your doctor monitor the growth of these tumors carefully"
5315,What causes cancers of the head and neck?,"Alcohol and tobacco use (including smokeless tobacco, sometimes called “ chewing tobacco ” or “ snuff ”) are the two most important risk factors for head and neck cancers, especially cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. At least 75% of head and neck cancers are caused by tobacco and alcohol use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk of developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone. tobacco and alcohol use are not risk factors for salivary gland cancers.
Infection with cancer -causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV type 16, is a risk factor for some types of head and neck cancers, particularly oropharyngeal cancers that involve the tonsils or the base of the tongue. In the United States, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer s caused by HPV infectio n is increasing, while the incidenc e of oropharyngeal cancer s related to other causes is falling.
Other risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:
Paan (betel quid), immigrants from Southeast Asia who use paan (betel quid) in the mouth should be aware that this habit has been strongly associated with an increased risk of oral cancer.
Preserved or salted foods, consumption of certain preserved or salted foods during childhood is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer.
Oral health, poor oral hygiene and missing teeth may be weak risk factors for cancers of the oral cavity. Use of mouthwash that has a high alcohol content is a possible, but not proven, risk factor for cancers of the oral cavity.
Occupational exposure, occupational exposure to wood dust is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer. Certain industrial exposures, including exposures to asbestos and synthetic fibers, have been associated with cancer of the larynx. Industrial exposure to wood or nickel dust or formaldehyde is a risk factor for cancers of the paranasal sinuse s and nasal cavity.
Radiation exposure, radiation to the head and neck, for noncancerous conditions or cancer, is a risk factor for cancer of the salivary glands.
Epstein-Barr virus infection, infection with the Epstein-Barr virus is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer of the salivary glands.
Ancestry. Asian ancestry, particularly Chinese ancestry, is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer."
5316,What are the symptoms of head and neck cancers?,"The symptoms of head and neck cancers may include a lump or a sore that does not heal, a sore throat that does not go away, difficulty in swallowing, and a change or hoarseness in the voice. These symptoms may also be caused by other, less serious conditions. It is important to check with a doctor or dentist about any of these symptoms. Symptoms that may affect specific areas of the head and neck include the following:
Oral cavity. A white or red patch on the gums, the tongu e, or the lining of the mout h; a swelling of the jaw that causes dentures to fit poorly or become uncomfortable; and unusual bleedin g or pain in the mouth.
Pharynx. Trouble breathing or speaking; pain when swallowing; pain in the neck or the throat that does not go away; frequent headaches, pain, or ringing in the ears; or trouble hearing.
Larynx. Pain when swallowing or ear pain.
Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Sinuses that are blocked and do not clear; chronic sinus infections that do not respond to treatment with antibiotics; bleeding through the nose; frequent headaches, swelling or other trouble with the eyes; pain in the upper teeth; or problems with dentures.
Salivary glands. Swelling under the chin or around the jawbone, numbness or paralysis of the muscles in the face, or pain in the face, the chin, or the neck that does not go away."
5317,How common are head and neck cancers?,"Head and neck cancers account for approximately 4% of all cancers in the United States. These cancers are more than twice as common among men as they are among women. Head and neck cancers are also diagnosed more often among people over age 50 than they are among younger people.
Researchers estimated that more than 65,000 men and women in this country would be diagnosed with head and neck cancers in 2017."
5318,How can I reduce my risk of developing head and neck cancers?,"People who are at risk of head and neck cancers ―particularly those who use tobacco ―should talk with their doctor about ways that they may be able to reduce their risk. They should also discuss with their doctor how often to have checkups. In addition, ongoing clinical trials are testing the effectiveness of various medications in preventing head and neck cancers in people who have a high risk of developing these diseases. Descriptions of these clinical trials can be accessed by searching NCI ’s list of cancer clinical trials. NCI ’s list of cancer clinical trials includes all NCI -supported clinical trials that are taking place across the United States and Canada, including the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. For information about other ways to search the list, see Help Finding NCI -Supported Clinical trials.
Information specialists from NCI ’s Cancer Information Service (CIS) can also help people find clinical trials for the prevention of head and neck cancers. The CIS can be reached at 1–800–4–CANCER (1–800–422–6237) or by chatting with a cancer information specialist online through LiveHelp.
Avoiding oral HPV infection may reduce the risk of HPV -associated head and neck cancers. However, it is not yet known whether the Food and Drug Administration -approved HPV vaccine s Gardasil ®, Gardasil 9®, and Cervarix ® prevent HPV infection of the oral cavity, and none of these vaccines has yet been approved for the prevention of oropharyngeal cancer. More information about these vaccines is in the NCI fact sheet Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines."
5319,How are head and neck cancers diagnosed?,"To find the cause of the signs or symptoms of a problem in the head and neck area, a doctor evaluates a person’s medical history, performs a physical examination, and orders diagnostic tests. The exams and tests may vary depending on the symptoms. Examination of a sample of tissue under a microscope is always necessary to confirm a diagnosis of cancer.
If the diagnosis is cancer, the doctor will want to learn the stage (or extent) of diseas e. Staging is a careful attempt to find out whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to which parts of the body. Staging may involve an examination under anesthesia (in an operating room), x-rays and other imaging procedures, and laboratory tests. Knowing the stage of the disease helps the doctor plan treatment."
5320,How are head and neck cancers treated?,"The treatment plan for an individual patient depends on a number of factors, including the exact location of the tumor, the stage of the cancer, and the person’s age and general health. Treatment for head and neck cancer can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of treatments.
People who are diagnosed with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer may be treated differently than people with oropharyngeal cancers that are HPV-negative. Recent research has shown that patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumors have a better prognosis and may do just as well on less intense treatment."
5321,What are the side effects of treatment?,"Surgery for head and neck cancers often changes the patient’s ability to chew, swallow, or talk. The patient may look different after surgery, and the face and neck may be swollen. The swelling usually goes away within a few weeks. However, if lymph nodes are removed, the flow of lymph in the area where they were removed may be slower and lymph could collect in the tissues, causing additional swelling; this swelling may last for a long time.
After a laryngectomy (surgery to remove the larynx) or other surgery in the neck, parts of the neck and throat may feel numb because nerves have been cut. If lymph nodes in the neck were removed, the shoulder and neck may become weak and stiff.
Patients who receive radiation to the head and neck may experience redness, irritation, and sores in the mouth; a dry mouth or thickened saliva; difficulty in swallowing; changes in taste; or nausea. Other problems that may occur during treatment are loss of taste, which may decrease appetite and affect nutrition, and earaches (caused by the hardening of ear wax). Patients may also notice some swelling or drooping of the skin under the chin and changes in the texture of the skin. The jaw may feel stiff, and patients may not be able to open their mouth as wide as before treatment.
Patients should report any side effects to their doctor or nurse, and discuss how to deal with them."
5322,Where can I find more information about clinical trials for patients with head and neck cancers?,"Clinical trials are research studies conducted with people who volunteer to take part. Participation in clinical trials is an option for many patients with head and neck cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are testing the effectiveness of treatments for head and neck cancers. Descriptions of these clinical trials can be accessed by searching NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials, which includes all NCI-supported clinical trials that are taking place across the United States and Canada, including the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. For information about other ways to search the list, see Help Finding NCI-Supported Clinical Trials. Alternatively, call NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) for information about clinical trials for individuals with head and neck cancer, or chat with a cancer information specialist online through LiveHelp.
People interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk with their doctor. Information about clinical trials is available in the NCI publication Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies. This resource describes how research studies are carried out and explains their possible benefits and risks."
5323,What are the symptoms of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer?,"Common symptoms of lung cancer include
A cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time Constant chest pain Coughing up blood Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness Repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis Swelling of the neck and face Loss of appetite or weight loss Fatigue"
5324,Who is at highest risk for Large cell carcinoma of the lung ?,"People with constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk. Working with or near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Such chemicals include:
Asbestos Chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust Certain alloys, paints, pigments, and preservatives Products using chloride and formaldehyde"
5325,What to expect if I have Large cell carcinoma of the lung  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook varies. Most often, non small cell lung cancer grows slowly. In some cases, it can grow and spread quickly and cause rapid death. The cancer may spread to other parts of the body, including the bone, liver, small intestine, and brain. Chemotherapy has been shown to prolong life and improve the quality of life in some patients with stage IV non small cell lung cancer. Cure rates are related to the stage of disease and whether you are able to have surgery.
Stage I and II cancers have the highest survival and cure rates. Stage III cancer can be cured in some cases. Stage IV cancer that has returned is almost never cured. The goals of therapy are to extend and improve quality of life."
5326,What are the symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma?,"In its earliest stages, hepatocellular carcinoma does not cause any symptoms. When the tumors grow larger, people may notice one or more of the following symptoms:
Abdominal pain and vague abdominal fullness: At first the location of the abdominal pain you are experiencing may be isolated on the upper-right part of your abdomen. It is usually relatively mild pain or no pain at all that is present with this life-threatening condition. With the development of cancer, abdominal pain is usually persistent. Abdominal lump: People cannot find any lump at the beginning of the disease. When the tumor begins to enlarge, the lump may be obvious in the abdominal region. Jaundice and itching: This is caused by hepatocellular necrosis and obstruction of bile in the bile ducts. Nausea and vomiting: Hepatocellular carcinoma disturbs the normal functions of digestion. Vomiting blood: This symptom is attributed to many factors such as dysfunction of the liver and spleen. Loss of appetite General decline in health Weakness or fatigue Fever
Infections or other health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
5327,Who is at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma?,"There are some factors that may increase your risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. These risk factors include:

5328,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Liver cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma develop. If one or more of the following symptoms emerge, seek medical care as soon as possible:
Sudden severe abdominal pain and a decrease in blood pressure: The reason a person with hepatocellular carcinoma has sudden severe abdominal pain is sometimes due to a ruptured carcinoma. This is the result of cancer developing very fast. Sometimes if the carcinoma invades the main vessel it results in a hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity and the patients may feel sudden abdominal pain. Vomiting a lot of blood: This is the result of complications such as dysfunction of the liver or synthetic blood coagulation factors and esophagogastric fundus vein rupture. An abundant amount of blood loss due to vomiting may lead to shock and even death."
5329,What to expect if I have Liver cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is poor and it depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery The stage of cancer: the size of the tumor, whether cancer has spread outside the liver The patient’s general health Whether cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
5330,What are the symptoms of Lung cancer?,"Early lung cancer often does not cause symptoms. But as the cancer grows, common symptoms may include:
A cough that gets worse or does not go away Breathing trouble, such as shortness of breath Constant chest pain Coughing up blood A hoarse voice Frequent lung infections, such as pneumonia Feeling very tired all the time Weight loss with no known cause
Most often these symptoms are not due to cancer. Other health problems can cause some of these symptoms. Anyone with such symptoms should see a doctor to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible."
5331,What causes Lung cancer?,"Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.
Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45.
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer.
The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the earlier you started smoking, the greater your risk of lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk.
However, lung cancer has occurred in people who have never smoked.
Secondhand smoke (breathing the smoke of others) increases your risk of lung cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 3,000 nonsmoking adults will die each year from lung cancer related to breathing secondhand smoke.
The following may also increase one's risk of lung cancer:
High levels of air pollution High levels of arsenic in drinking water Radon gas Asbestos Family history of lung cancer Radiation therapy to the lungs Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust"
5332,Who is at highest risk for Lung mass ?,"Studies have found the following risk factors for lung cancer:
Tobacco smoke: Tobacco smoke causes most cases of lung cancer. It's by far the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Harmful substances in smoke damage lung cells. That's why smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars can cause lung cancer and why secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmokers. The more a person is exposed to smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. For more information, see the NCI fact sheets Quitting Smoking and Secondhand Smoke.
Radon: Radon is a radioactive gas that you cannot see, smell, or taste. It forms in soil and rocks. People who work in mines may be exposed to radon. In some parts of the country, radon is found in houses. Radon damages lung cells, and people exposed to radon are at increased risk of lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer from radon is even higher for smokers. For more information, see the NCI fact sheet Radon and Cancer.
Asbestos and other substances: People who have certain jobs (such as those who work in the construction and chemical industries) have an increased risk of lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, soot, tar, and other substances can cause lung cancer. The risk is highest for those with years of exposure. The risk of lung cancer from these substances is even higher for smokers.
Air pollution: Air pollution may slightly increase the risk of lung cancer. The risk from air pollution is higher for smokers.
Family history of lung cancer: People with a father, mother, brother, or sister who had lung cancer may be at slightly increased risk of the disease, even if they don't smoke.
Personal history of lung cancer: People who have had lung cancer are at increased risk of developing a second lung tumor.
Age over 65: Most people are older than 65 years when diagnosed with lung cancer."
5333,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Lung mass ?,Anyone with symptoms similar to those listed above should see a doctor to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
5334,What to expect if I have Lung mass  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of pancreatic is poor and it depends on the following:
Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. The stage of the cancer: the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread outside the pancreas The patient’s general health Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred"
5335,What are the symptoms of Mediastinal tumor?,"Almost half of mediastinal tumors cause no symptoms and are found on a chest x-ray performed for another reason. Symptoms that do occur are due to pressure on (compression of) local structures and may include:
Chest pain Chills Cough Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) Fever Hoarseness Night sweats Shortness of breath"
5336,What causes Mediastinal tumor?,"The mediastinum is the part of the chest that lies between the sternum and the spinal column, and between the lungs. This area contains the heart, large blood vessels, windpipe (trachea), thymus gland, and connective tissues.
The mediastinum is divided into three sections:
Anterior (front) Middle Posterior (back)
Mediastinal tumors are rare.
The most common location for tumors in the mediastinum depends on the age of the patient. In children, tumors are more common in the posterior mediastinum. These tumors often begin in the nerves and are non-cancerous (benign).
Most mediastinal tumors in adults occur in the anterior mediastinum and are usually cancerous (malignant) lymphomas or thymomas. These tumors are most common in people ages 30 - 50."
5337,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mediastinal tumor ?,Call your health care provider if you notice symptoms of a mediastinal tumor.
5338,What to expect if I have Mediastinal tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome depends on the type of tumor. Different tumors respond differently to chemotherapy and radiation.
5339,What are the symptoms of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,"Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Cough Coughing up blood Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks Neck pain Sore throat that does not get better in 1 - 2 weeks, even with antibiotics Swelling or lumps in the neck Unintentional weight loss"
5340,What causes Nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Excessive alcohol use also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancers.
5341,Who is at highest risk for Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ?,Most cancers of the throat develop in adults older than 50. Men are 10 times more likely than women to develop throat cancers.
5342,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of throat cancer, especially hoarseness or a change in voice with no obvious cause that lasts longer than 3 weeks You find a lump in your neck that does not go away in 2 - 3 weeks"
5343,What to expect if I have Nasopharyngeal carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Throat cancers can be cured in 90% of patients if detected early. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, 50 - 60% of patients can be cured. If the cancer has spread (metastasized) to parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable and treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life.
After treatment, patients generally need therapy to help with speech and swallowing. A small percentage of patients (5%) will not be able to swallow and will need to be fed through a feeding tube."
5344,What are the symptoms of Osteochondroma?,"In many cases, solitary osteochondromas do not cause any symptoms, or symptoms may arise long after tumors develop. Osteochondroma is most often diagnosed in patients aged 10 to 20 years.
Common symptoms osteochondroma include:
A painless bump near the joints Pain with activity Numbness or tingling Changes in blood flow (loss of pulse or changes in color of the limb)"
5345,What are the causes of Osteochondroma?,"The cause of osteochondroma may be related to genetic mutations, such as:
Germ line mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 genes"
5346,Who is at highest risk of Osteochondroma?,"Common risk factors in the development of osteochondromas, include:
Previous trauma to the growth plate Exposure to previous radiation Congenital limb anomalies"
5347,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Osteochondroma patient information?,Call your orthopaedic oncologist if symptoms of osteochondroma develops.
5348,What to expect if I have Osteochondroma patient information (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Osteochondroma prognosis is generally regarded good after surgical excision.
5349,What are the symptoms of Osteoid Osteoma?,"Osteomas are usually present with night limb pain and swelling. In some cases, a person will suffer from bowing deformity before seeing a doctor for diagnosis."
5350,Who is at highest risk for Osteoid osteoma patient information?,Children and adolescents.
5351,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Osteoid osteoma patient information?,"Call your Orthopedics specialist if symptoms of osteoid osteoma occur, such as nocturnal limb pain (relieved by low doses of salicylates) and local tenderness."
5352,What to expect if I have Osteoid osteoma patient information (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of osteoma will depends on location and adjacent structures to the tumor.
5353,What are the symptoms of Osteoma?,"Osteomas are usually asymptomatic. However if symptoms occur, common symptoms can be dull, aching facial pain. In some cases, a person will suffer from facial deformity before seeing a doctor for diagnosis."
5354,Who is at highest risk for Osteoma patient information?,There are no known risk factors for osteoma.
5355,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Osteoma patient information?,"Call your ENT specialist if symptoms of osteoma, such as facial deformity, vision loss, and anosmia develop."
5356,What to expect if I have Osteoma patient information (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis of osteoma will depends on the size, location and adjacent structures to the tumor."
5357,What are the symptoms of Rhabdomyosarcoma?,"The most common symptom is a mass that may or may not be painful.
Other symptoms vary depending on location of the tumor.
Tumors in the nose or throat may cause bleeding, congestion, swallowing problems, or neurological problems if they extend into the brain. Tumors around the eyes may cause bulging of the eye, problems with vision, swelling around the eye, or pain. Tumors in the ears, may cause pain, hearing loss, or swelling. Bladder and vaginal tumors may cause lead to trouble starting to urinate or having a bowel movement, or poor control of urine. Muscle tumors may lead to a painful lump and are often thought to be an injury."
5358,What to expect if I have Rhabdomyosarcoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"While aggressive treatment is usually necessary, most children with rhabdomyosarcoma will achieve long-term survival. Cure depends on the specific type of tumor, its location, and the amount that has spread."
5359,What are the symptoms of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer?,"Common symptoms of lung cancer include
A cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time Constant chest pain Coughing up blood Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness Repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis Swelling of the neck and face Loss of appetite or weight loss Fatigue"
5360,Who is at highest risk for Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung ?,"People with constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk. Working with or near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Such chemicals include:
Asbestos Chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust Certain alloys, paints, pigments, and preservatives Products using chloride and formaldehyde"
5361,What to expect if I have Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook varies. Most often, non small cell lung cancer grows slowly. In some cases, it can grow and spread quickly and cause rapid death. The cancer may spread to other parts of the body, including the bone, liver, small intestine, and brain. Chemotherapy has been shown to prolong life and improve the quality of life in some patients with stage IV non small cell lung cancer. Cure rates are related to the stage of disease and whether you are able to have surgery.
Stage I and II cancers have the highest survival and cure rates. Stage III cancer can be cured in some cases. Stage IV cancer that has returned is almost never cured. The goals of therapy are to extend and improve quality of life."
5362,What are the symptoms of Transitional cell carcinoma?,"Symptoms of bladder cancer can include:
Abdominal pain Blood in the urine Bone pain or tenderness Fatigue Painful urination Urinary frequency Urinary urgency Urine leakage (incontinence) Weight loss
Note: Other diseases and conditions can cause similiar symptoms. It is important to see a doctor to rule out all other possible causes."
5363,What causes Transitional cell carcinoma?,"In the United States, bladder cancers usually start from the cells lining the bladder (called transitional cells).
These tumors are classified based on the way they grow:
Papillary tumors have a wart-like appearance and are attached to a stalk. Nonpapillary (sessile) tumors are much less common. However, they are more invasive and have a worse outcome."
5364,Who is at highest risk for Transitional cell carcinoma ?,"The exact cause of bladder cancer is uncertain. However, several things may make you more likely to develop it:
Cigarette smoking. Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Up to half of all bladder cancers in men and several in women may be caused by cigarette smoke. Chemical exposure at work. About one in four cases of bladder cancer is caused by coming into contact with to cancer-causing chemicals at work. These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk. Chemotherapy: The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) may increase the risk of bladder cancer. Radiation treatment: Women who had radiation therapy to treat cervical cancer have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. Bladder infection: A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer.
Some research has suggested a link between artificial sweeteners and bladder cancer. The evidence is weak."
5365,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Transitional cell carcinoma ?,"Call your health care provider if you have blood in your urine or other symptoms of bladder cancer, including:
Frequent urination Painful urination Urgent need to urinate
Also, call your health care provider for an appointment if:
You are exposed to possible cancer-causing chemicals at work You smoke"
5366,What to expect if I have Transitional cell carcinoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After treatment for bladder cancer, you will be closely monitored by a doctor. This may include:
Bone scans and CT scans to check for the spread or return of cancer
Monitoring symptoms that might suggest the disease is getting worse, such as fatigue, weight loss, increased pain, decreased bowel and bladder function, and weakness
Complete blood count (CBC) to monitor for anemia Bladder exams every 3 to 6 months after treatment Urinalysis if you did not have your bladder removed
How well a patient with bladder cancer does depends on the initial stage and response to treatment of the bladder cancer.
The outlook for stage 0 or I cancers is fairly good. Although the risk of the cancer returning is high, most bladder cancers that return can be surgically removed and cured.
The cure rates for people with stage III tumors are less than 50%. Patients with stage IV bladder cancer are rarely cured."
5367,What are the symptoms of Uveal melanoma?,Intraocular melanoma may not cause early signs or symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor dilates the pupil and looks into the eye. Signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions.
5368,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Uveal melanoma ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of melanoma of the eye.
5369,What to expect if I have Uveal melanoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:
How the melanoma cells look under a microscope. The size and thickness of the tumor. The part of the eye the tumor is in (the iris, ciliary body, or choroid). Whether the tumor has spread within the eye or to other places in the body. Whether there are certain changes in the genes linked to intraocular melanoma. The patient's age and general health. Whether the tumor has recurred (come back) after treatment."
5370,What are the symptoms of Behcet's syndrome?,"The symptoms of Behçet's disease differ from one person to the next. Some people have only mild symptoms, such as sores in the mouth, while others have more severe problems, such as vision loss.
The five most common symptoms of Behçet's disease are:
Mouth sores Genital sores Other skin sores Swelling of parts of the eye Arthritis (pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints)
Less common symptoms include:
Inflammation in the brain and spinal cord Blood clots Inflammation in the digestive system (the parts of the body that digest food) Blindness
Symptoms may appear, disappear, and then reappear. The times when a person is having symptoms are called flares."
5371,What causes Behcet's syndrome?,"Nearly all of the symptoms of Behçet's disease are due to an inflammation of the blood vessels. Doctors aren't sure what causes this inflammation. Some people may have inherited (passed on from parent to child) a problem with the immune system that makes them more likely to develop the disease. For these people, contact with substances in the environment, such as bacteria or viruses, may cause the immune system to attack the blood vessels. Behçet's disease is not contagious; it is not spread from one person to another."
5372,Who is at highest risk for Behcet%27s syndrome ?,"Doctors aren't sure what causes Behcet's. It is rare in the United States, but is common in the Middle East and Asia. It mainly affects people in their 20s and 30s. Diagnosing Behcet's can take a long time, because symptoms may come and go, and it may take months or even years to have all of the symptoms. There is no cure. Treatment focuses on reducing pain and preventing serious problems."
5373,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Behcet%27s syndrome ?,Call your health care provider if you are having these symptoms.
5374,What to expect if I have Behcet%27s syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"There is no cure for Behçet's disease, but most people can control symptoms with treatment."
5375,What are the symptoms of an Eyelid twitch?,"In addition to having repetitive, uncontrollable twitching or spasms of your eyelid (usually the upper lid), you may be very sensitive to light or have blurry vision."
5376,What causes an Eyelid twitch?,"The most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine. Once spasms begin, they may continue off and on for a few days. Then, they disappear. Most people experience this type of eyelid twitch on occasion and find it very annoying. In most cases, you won't even notice when the twitch has stopped.
More severe contractions, where the eyelid completely closes, are possible. These can be caused by irritation of the surface of the eye (cornea) or the membranes lining the eyelids (conjunctiva).
Sometimes, the reason your eyelid is twitching cannot be identified. This form of eyelid twitching lasts much longer, is often very uncomfortable, and can also cause your eyelids to close completely."
5377,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Blepharospasm ?,"Call your primary care doctor or eye doctor (ophthalmologist, optometrist) if:
Eyelid twitching does not go away within 1 week Twitching completely closes your eyelid Twitching involves other parts of your face You have redness, swelling, or a discharge from your eye Your upper eyelid is drooping"
5378,What to expect if I have Blepharospasm  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on the specific type or cause of eyelid twitch. In some cases, the twitches usually stop within a week."
5379,What are the symptoms of Chalazion?,Eyelid tenderness Increased tearing Painful swelling on the eyelid Sensitivity to light
5380,What causes Chalazion?,"A chalazion develops in the glands that produce the fluid that lubricates the eye. These are called Meibomian glands. The eyelid has approximately 100 of these glands, which are located near the eyelashes.
A chalazion is caused by a blockage of the duct that drains one of these glands."
5381,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Chalazion ?,"Apply warm compresses and call your health care provider if the swelling gets worse or continues for longer than 1 month.
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if lumps on the eyelid continue to get bigger despite treatment, or you have an area of eyelash loss."
5382,What to expect if I have Chalazion  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Chalazia usually heal on their own. The outcome with treatment is usually excellent.
5383,What causes Cloudy cornea?,"The cornea is normally a nearly invisible, clear structure covering the iris of the eye. Its two purposes are to transmit and focus the light entering the eye.
Causes of cloudy cornea include:
Chemical burns to the cornea Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (a form of conjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex) Infectious diseases Poor nutrition River blindness (onchocerciasis -- an infection common in parts of Africa) Several rare inherited diseases involving abnormal metabolism Sjogren syndrome Trachoma Trauma Vitamin A deficiency
Clouding leads to varying degrees of vision loss."
5384,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cloudy cornea ?,"Contact your health care provider if:
The outer surface of the eye appears cloudy You have trouble with your vision
Note: It is appropriate to see an ophthalmologist for vision or eye problems. However, your primary health care provider may also be involved if a whole-body (systemic) disease is suspected."
5385,What to expect if I have Cloudy cornea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The health care provider will examine your eyes and ask questions about your medical history.
Questions may include:
Did the cornea become cloudy quickly, or did it develop slowly? When did you first notice this? Does it affect both eyes? Is there any history of injury to the eye? What other symptoms do you have? Do you have any trouble with your vision? If so, what type (blurring, reduced vision, or other) and how much?
Tests may include:
Biopsy of lid tissue Ophthalmoscopy Special photographs to measure the cells of the cornea Standard eye exam Ultrasound to measure corneal thickness"
5386,What causes Cloudy cornea?,"The cornea is normally a nearly invisible, clear structure covering the iris of the eye. Its two purposes are to transmit and focus the light entering the eye.

Clouding leads to varying degrees of vision loss."
5387,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Corneal edema ?,"Contact your health care provider if:
The outer surface of the eye appears cloudy You have trouble with your vision
Note: It is appropriate to see an ophthalmologist for vision or eye problems. However, your primary health care provider may also be involved if a whole-body (systemic) disease is suspected."
5388,What to expect if I have Corneal edema  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The health care provider will examine your eyes and ask questions about your medical history.
Questions may include:
Did the cornea become cloudy quickly, or did it develop slowly? When did you first notice this? Does it affect both eyes? Is there any history of injury to the eye? What other symptoms do you have? Do you have any trouble with your vision? If so, what type (blurring, reduced vision, or other) and how much?
Tests may include:
Biopsy of lid tissue Ophthalmoscopy Special photographs to measure the cells of the cornea Standard eye exam Ultrasound to measure corneal thickness"
5389,What are the symptoms of Corneal injury?,"Being very sensitive to light Blurred vision Decrease in vision Eye pain or stinging and burning in the eye Feeling like something is in your eye, called a foreign-body sensation Redness of the eye, ""bloodshot"" eyes Swollen eyelids Watery eyes or increased tearing"
5390,What causes Corneal injury?,"Injuries to the cornea are common.
Injuries to the outer surface of the cornea, called corneal abrasions, may be caused by:
Chemical irritation - from almost any fluid that gets into the eye Overuse of contact lenses or lenses that don't fit correctly Reaction or sensitivity to contact lens solutions and cosmetics Scratches or scrapes on the surface of the cornea (called an abrasion) Something getting into the eye (such as sand or dust) Sunlight, sun lamps, snow or water reflections, or arc-welding
Infections may also damage the cornea."
5391,Who is at highest risk for Corneal injury ?,"You are more likely to develop a corneal injury if you:
Are exposed to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light for long periods of time Have ill-fitting contact lenses or overuse your contact lenses Have very dry eyes Work in a dusty environment
High-speed particles, such as chips from hammering metal on metal, may become embedded in the surface of the cornea. Rarely, they may pass through the cornea and go deeper into the eye."
5392,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Corneal injury ?,Call your health care provider if the injury has not significantly improved in 2 days with treatment
5393,What to expect if I have Corneal injury  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Injuries that affect only the surface of the cornea normally heal very rapidly with treatment. The eye should be back to normal within 2 days.
Penetrating corneal injuries are much more serious. The outcome depends on the specific injury."
5394,What are the symptoms of Strabismus?,"Symptoms of strabismus may be present all the time, or only when you are tired or sick.
The eyes do not move together and may appear crossed at times.
The other eye will appear turned out, up, or down from wherever the first eye is focused.
Someone with strabismus may also have:
Depth perception loss Double vision Vision loss"
5395,What causes Strabismus?,"Six different muscles surround the eyes and work ""as a team"" so that both eyes can focus on the same object.
In someone with strabismus, these muscles do not work together. As a result, one eye looks at one object, while the other eye turns in a different direction and is focused on another object.
When this occurs, two different images are sent to the brain -- one from each eye. This confuses the brain, and the brain may learn to ignore the image from the weaker eye.
If the strabismus is not treated, the eye that the brain ignores will never see well. This loss of vision is called amblyopia. Another name for amblyopia is ""lazy eye."" Sometimes amblyopia is present first, and it causes strabismus.
In most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown. In more than half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth (congenital strabismus).
Most of the time, the problem has to do with muscle control, and not with muscle strength.
Less often, problems with one of the nerves or muscles, or Graves' disease restriction may cause strabismus.
Other disorders associated with strabismus include:
Brain and nerve disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or Guillain-Barre syndrome Diabetes (causes a condition known as acquired paralytic strabismus) Damage to the retina in children who are born premature Hemangioma near the eye during infancy Injuries to the eye Tumor in the brain or eye Vision loss from any eye disease or injury"
5396,Who is at highest risk for Crossed eyes ?,"A family history of strabismus is a risk factor. Farsightedness may be a contributing factor, especially in children. Any other disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus."
5397,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Crossed eyes ?,"Strabismus requires prompt medical evaluation. Call for an appointment with your health care provider or eye doctor if your child:
Appears to be cross-eyed Complains of double vision Has difficulty seeing
Note: Learning difficulties or problems at school can sometimes be due to a child's inability to see the blackboard or reading material."
5398,What to expect if I have Crossed eyes  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After surgery, the eyes may look straight but vision problems can remain.
The child may still have reading problems in school, and for adults driving may be more difficult. Vision may affect the ability to play sports.
With early diagnosis and treatment, the problem can usually be corrected. Delayed treatment may lead to permanent vision loss in one eye. About one-third of children with strabismus will develop amblyopia.
Because many children will get strabismus or amblyopia again, they need to be monitored closely."
5399,What are the symptoms of Dacryoadenitis?,"Swelling of the outer portion of the upper lid, with possible redness and tenderness Pain in the area of swelling Excess tearing or discharge Swelling of lymph nodes in front of the ear"
5400,What causes Dacryoadenitis?,"Acute dacryoadenitis is most commonly due to viral or bacterial infection. Common causes include mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, staphylococcus, and gonococcus.
Chronic dacryoadenitis is usually due to noninfectious inflammatory disorders. Examples include sarcoidosis, thyroid eye disease, and orbital pseudotumor."
5401,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dacryoadenitis ?,Call your health care provider if swelling or pain increase despite treatment.
5402,What to expect if I have Dacryoadenitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most patients will fully recover from dacryoadenitis. For conditions with more serious causes, such as sarcoidosis, the prognosis is that of the underlying condition."
5403,What causes Dry eye syndrome?,"Dry eye syndrome often occurs in people who are otherwise healthy.
In rare cases, it can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and other similar diseases. It may also be caused by heat (thermal) or chemical burns.
In areas of the world where malnutrition is common, vitamin A deficiency is a cause. This is rare in the United States."
5404,Who is at highest risk for Dry eye syndrome ?,"It is more common with older age, because you produce fewer tears with age."
5405,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dry eye syndrome ?,"See your health care provider immediately if you have dry eyes and have:
A sudden increase in discomfort or redness A sudden decrease in vision"
5406,What to expect if I have Dry eye syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most patients with dry eye have only discomfort, and no vision loss. With severe cases, the clear window on the front of the eye (cornea) may become damaged or infected."
5407,What are the symptoms of Dry eyes?,"If you have dry eyes, you will feel a burning, scratching, or stinging sensation. You may also have strained or tired eyes after reading, even for short periods of time. If you wear contacts, they will likely feel uncomfortable. Having dry eyes for a while can lead to tiny abrasions on the surface of your eyes."
5408,What causes Dry eyes?,"Common causes of dry eyes include:
Aging Dry environment or workplace (wind, air conditioning) Sun exposure Smoking or second-hand smoke exposure Cold or allergy medicines An eye injury or other problem with your eyes or eyelids (like a drooping eyelid or bulging eyes) Sjogren's syndrome -- includes dry eyes, mouth, and mucus membranes, and often rheumatoid arthritis or other joint disorder Previous eye surgery"
5409,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dry eyes ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have red or painful eyes. You have flaking, discharge, or a lesion on your eye or eyelid. You have had trauma to your eye, or you have a bulging eye or a drooping eyelid. You have joint pain, swelling, or stiffness. You also have a dry mouth. Your dry eyes do not respond to self-care measures within a few days."
5410,What to expect if I have Dry eyes  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Your health care provider will take a medical history and perform a physical examination, including a careful eye examination.
To help better understand your dry eyes, your health care provider may ask the following:
How long have you had dry eyes? Does it involve one or both eyes? Do you have it all of the time or does it only occur at certain times, with certain activities, or in certain places? Does the dryness seem related to wind, dust, chemicals, sun, or light exposure? Does it affect your vision? Does it cause pain? Do your eyelids close easily? Have you noticed any drainage from your eyes? Does anything make your dry eyes worse? Does anything make your dry eyes better? Have you tried artificial tears? Do they help? Are you taking any medications? Which ones? Have you had surgery or an injury to your eyes or nose? Do you have allergies? Have you been using any new cosmetics? Do you have any other symptoms like dry mouth or joint discomfort?
Your health care provider may perform tearing tests that can help diagnose dry eyes. Artificial tears may be prescribed."
5411,What are the symptoms of a floater?,"People with floaters notice small specks or ""cobwebs"" floating in their field of vision that are especially noticeable when looking at something bright, such as white paper or a blue sky. They move as your eyes move and seem to dart away when you try to look at them directly. They do not follow your eye movements precisely, and usually drift when your eyes stop moving.
Most people have floaters and learn to ignore them; they are usually not noticed until they become numerous or more prominent."
5412,What are the causes of a floater?,"Floaters occur when the vitreous, a gel-like substance that fills about 80 percent of the eye and helps it maintain a round shape, slowly shrinks. As the vitreous shrinks, it becomes somewhat stringy, and the strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina. These are floaters.
However, there are other, more serious causes of floaters, including infection, inflammation (uveitis), hemorrhaging, retinal tears, and injury to the eye."
5413,Who is at highest risk for Floater ?,"Floaters are more likely to develop as we age and are more common in people who are very nearsighted, have diabetes, or who have had a cataract operation."
5414,How to know you have a floater?,"Floaters are often readily observed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist with the use of an ophthalmoscope or slit lamp. However, if the floater is a small piece of debris and near the retina it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the sufferer.
Increasing background illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow a person to obtain a better view of his or her own floaters. The head may be tilted in such a way that one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye. In the sharpened image the fibrous elements are more conspicuous. 
The presence of retinal tears with new onset of floaters was surprisingly high (14%; 95% confidence interval, 12%-16%) as reported in a meta-analysis published as part of the Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Patients with new onset flashes and/or floaters, especially when associated with visual loss or restriction in the visual field, should seek more urgent ophthalmologic evaluation."
5415,What to expect if I have Floater  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In most cases, floaters are part of the natural aging process and simply an annoyance. They can be distracting at first, but eventually tend to ""settle"" at the bottom of the eye, becoming less bothersome. They usually settle below the line of sight but do not go away completely.
Sometimes a section of the vitreous pulls the fine fibers away from the retina all at once, rather than gradually, causing many new floaters to appear suddenly. This is called a vitreous detachment, which in most cases is not sight-threatening and requires no treatment.
However, a sudden increase in floaters, possibly accompanied by light flashes or peripheral (side) vision loss, could indicate a retinal detachment. If left untreated, a retinal detachment can lead to permanent visual impairment within two or three days or even blindness in the eye."
5416,What are the symptoms of Fuchs' dystrophy?,"Eye pain Eye sensitivity to light, especially glare Foggy or blurred vision, at first only in the mornings Seeing colored halos around lights Worsening vision throughout the day"
5417,What causes Fuchs' dystrophy?,"Fuchs' dystrophy affects the thin layer of cells that line the back part of the cornea. This layer is called the endothelium. The disease occurs when these cells slowly start to die off. (The cause is unknown.) The cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a cloudy cornea.
At first, fluid may build up only during sleep, when the eye is closed. As the disease gets worse, small blisters may form in the endothelium. The blisters get bigger and may eventually break, causing eye pain. Fuchs' dystrophy can also cause the shape of the cornea to change, causing further vision problems."
5418,Who is at highest risk for Fuchs%27 dystrophy ?,"Fuchs' dystrophy can be inherited, which means it can be passed down from parents to children. In some families, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. That means that if either of your parents has the disease, you have a 50% chance of developing the condition.
However, the condition may also occur in persons without a known family history of the disease.
Fuchs' dystrophy is more common in women than in men. Vision problems usually do not appear before age 50, although doctors may be able to see signs of the disease in affected persons at an earlier age, usually in their 30s and 40s."
5419,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Fuchs%27 dystrophy ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
Eye pain Eye sensitivity to light The feeling that something is in your eye when there is nothing there Vision problems such as seeing halos or cloudy vision Worsening vision"
5420,What to expect if I have Fuchs%27 dystrophy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Fuchs' dystrophy gets worse over time. Without a corneal transplant, a patient with severe Fuchs' dystrophy may become blind or have severe pain and very reduced vision.
Mild cases of Fuchs' dystrophy often worsen after cataract surgery. A cataract surgeon will evaluate this risk and may modify the technique or the timing of your cataract surgery."
5421,What are the symptoms of Interstitial keratitis?,Eye pain Excessive tearing Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
5422,What causes Interstitial keratitis?,"Interstitial keratitis is a serious condition in which blood vessels grow into the cornea. Such growth can cause loss of the normal clearness of the cornea. This condition is often caused by infections.
Syphilis is the most common cause of interstitial keratitis, but rare causes include:
Autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis Leprosy Lyme disease Tuberculosis"
5423,Who is at highest risk for Interstitial keratitis ?,"In the United States, most cases of syphilis are recognized and treated before this eye condition develops. However, interstitial keratitis remains the most common cause of blindness in the world."
5424,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Interstitial keratitis ?,"All patients with interstitial keratitis will be closely followed by an ophthalmologist and a medical specialist with expertise in the underlying disease. Any worsening pain, increasing redness, or decreasing vision should be evaluated immediately. This is particularly crucial for patients with corneal transplants."
5425,What to expect if I have Interstitial keratitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Diagnosing and treating interstitial keratitis and its cause early can preserve the clear cornea and good vision.
5426,What are the symptoms of Keratoconus?,"The earliest symptom is subtle blurring of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses. (Vision can generally be corrected to 20/20 with rigid, gas-permeable contact lenses.)
Most people who develop keratoconus start out nearsighted. The nearsightedness tends to become worse over time."
5427,What causes Keratoconus?,"The cause is unknown, but the tendency to develop keratoconus is probably present from birth. Keratoconus is thought to involve a defect in collagen, the tissue that makes up most of the cornea.
Some researchers believe that allergy and eye rubbing may play a role.
Also, there is an association between keratoconus and Down syndrome."
5428,Who is at highest risk for Keratoconus ?,Most people who develop keratoconus start out nearsighted. The nearsightedness tends to become worse over time.
5429,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Keratoconus ?,Young persons whose vision cannot be corrected to 20/20 with glasses should be evaluated by an eye doctor experienced with keratoconus.
5430,What to expect if I have Keratoconus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In most cases vision can be corrected with rigid gas-permeable contact lenses.
If corneal transplantation is needed, results are usually good. The recovery period can be long, and patients often still need contact lenses."
5431,What are the symptoms of Lacrimal gland tumor?,Double vision Fullness in one eyelid or the side of the face Pain
5432,What to expect if I have Lacrimal gland tumor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If lacrimal gland tumor is not treated, the child may be permanently unable to fully move the elbow. With treatment, there is usually no permanent damage.
The outlook is generally excellent for noncancerous growths. The outlook for cancer depends on the type of cancer and stage at which it is discovered."
5433,How to Perform the Test?,"Adjust the focusing eyepiece of the lensometer so that it reads 0 D on the measuring drum with the target crisply in focus. Place the spectacles in the lensometer with the ocular surface away from the examiner. Measure the right lens first. Then measure the left lens. Center the spectacles within the carriage of the instrument so that the target is centrally aligned within the eyepiece reticle. From an excess plus power direction, rotate the power drum of the lensometer so that the target comes to a sharp focus in the first meridian,
simultaneously rotating the axis drum and making its target lines contiguous. This is the first meridian. Note the position of the power drum.
Continue rotating the power drum until the second meridian comes into sharp, contiguous focus. This is the second meridian. Note the position of the
power and axis drums.
If both meridians come to a sharp focus simultaneously, the lens is spherical. If there are two distinctly different foci, the lens is spherocylindrical. If there is an add, measure it. The spherical or spherocylindrical power and axis is recorded in minus cylinder form. The multifocal add, if present, is recorded as a plus add. 
Focus the lensometer before each reading. Carefully fine-tune the power and the axis drums. If the lens is a multifocal lens, look carefully for the maximum plus power position of the lens."
5434,What are the symptoms of Melanoma of the eye?,"Bulging eyes Change in iris color Poor vision in one eye Red, painful eye Small defect on the iris or conjunctiva
In some cases, there may be no symptoms."
5435,What causes Melanoma of the eye?,"Melanoma is a very aggressive type of cancer that can spread rapidly.
Melanoma of the eye can affect several parts of the eye, including the:
Choroid Ciliary body Conjunctiva Eyelid Iris Orbit
The choroid layer is the most likely location of melanoma in the eye.
The cancer may only be in the eye, or it may spread (metastasize) to another location in the body, most commonly the liver. Melanoma can also begin on the skin or other organs in the body and spread to the eye."
5436,Who is at highest risk for Melanoma of the eye ?,"Melanoma is the most common type of eye tumor in adults. Even so, primary melanoma of the eye is rare.
Excessive exposure to sunlight is an important risk factor. The occurrence of melanoma has greatly increased in recent decades. Fair-skinned and blue-eyed people are most often affected."
5437,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Melanoma of the eye ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of melanoma of the eye.
5438,What to expect if I have Melanoma of the eye  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome for melanoma of the eye depends on the size of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. Most patients will survive at least 5 years from the time of diagnosis if the cancer has not spread outside the eye.
If the cancer has spread outside the eye, the chance of survival is much lower."
5439,What are the symptoms of Myopia?,"A nearsighted person sees close up objects clearly, but objects in the distance are blurred. Squinting will tend to make far away objects seem clearer.
Nearsightedness is often first noticed in school-aged children or teenagers. Children often cannot read the blackboard, but they can easily read a book.
Nearsightedness gets worse during the growth years. People who are nearsighted need to change glasses or contact lenses often. It usually stops progressing as a person stops growing in his or her early twenties.
Other symptoms may include:
Eyestrain Headaches (uncommon)"
5440,What causes Myopia?,"People are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and points it to the back surface of the eye, called the retina.
Nearsightedness occurs when the physical length of the eye is greater than the optical length.
This makes it more difficult for the eyes to focus light directly on the retina. If the light rays are not clearly focused on the retina, the images you see may be blurry.
Watch this video about:Seeing
Nearsightedness affects males and females equally. People who have a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it. Most eyes with nearsightedness are healthy, but a small number of people with severe myopia develop a form of retinal degeneration."
5441,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Myopia ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if your child shows these signs, which may indicate a vision problem:
Having difficulty reading the blackboard in school or signs on a wall Holding books very close when reading Sitting close to the television
Call for an appointment with your eye doctor if you or your child is nearsighted and experiences signs of a possible retinal tear or detachment, including:
Flashing lights Floating spots Sudden loss of any part of the field of vision"
5442,What to expect if I have Myopia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Early diagnosis of nearsightedness is important, because a child can suffer socially and educationally by not being able to see well at a distance."
5443,What are the symptoms of Conjunctivitis?,"Redness (hyperaemia), irritation (chemosis) and watering (epiphora) of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis. Additionally, symptoms vary based on the specific type of conjunctivitis:
Allergic conjunctivitis: Main article: Allergic conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis is typically itchy, sometimes distressingly so, and often involves some eye swelling. Chronic allergy often causes just itching or irritation. Allergic conjunctivitis often causes pale watery swelling of the conjunctiva and sometimes the whole eyelid. There is frequently a sticky mucus discharge, and there is variable redness. Viral conjunctivitis: Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, and/or a sore throat. Its symptoms include watery discharge and variable itch. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other. Viral conjunctivitis is commonly known as ""pink eye."" Bacterial conjunctivitis: Bacterial conjunctivitis due to the common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, grey or yellowish mucopurulent discharge (mucus, gowl, goop, gunk, eye crust, or other regional names, officially known as' gound') that may cause the lids to stick together (matting), especially after sleeping. Another symptom that could be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis is severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin. However, discharge is not essential to the diagnosis, contrary to popular belief. Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness. The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Like viral conjunctivitis, it usually affects only one eye but may spread easily to the other eye. However, it is dormant in the eye for three days before the patient shows signs of symptoms. Chemical conjunctivitis: Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is irritable or painful when the infected eye is pointed far down or far up. Discharge and itch are usually absent. It show primarily marked redness. This is the only group in which severe pain may occur."
5444,What causes Conjunctivitis?,"Conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by viruses, often adenovirus, but many other factors can lead to its occurrence. Other causes include:
Allergies (allergic conjunctivitis) Bacteria Certain diseases Chemical exposure Chlamydia Fungi Parasites (rarely) Use of contact lenses (especially extended-wear lenses)
Conjunctivitis is spread from person-to-person by:
Direct contact with the infected person’s eye drainage or drainage from the person’s cough, sneeze, or runny nose. Indirect contact with objects that may have the infected person’s drainage on them (e.g. eye makeup applicators, towels, shared eye medications). Contact with the infected person’s fingers or hands which may contain the virus or bacteria.
Newborns can be infected by bacteria in the birth canal. This condition is called ophthalmia neonatorum, and it must be treated immediately to preserve eyesight. Additionally, neonatal conjunctivitis is a red eye in a newborn caused by irritation, a blocked tear duct, or infection."
5445,Who is at highest risk for Pinkeye ?,"People who are exposed to someone infected with the viral or bacterial form of conjunctivitis are at risk for developing conjunctivitis. Children and adults can develop both bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, however bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in young children. Additionally, babies born to mothers infected with either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are at an increased risk for conjunctivitis. During delivery, these babies can contract ophthalmia neonatorum, a form of bacterial conjunctivitis when their eyes are exposed to the bacteria in the birth canal. It must be treated immediately to prevent blindness."
5446,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pinkeye ?,"Urgent medical care is not usually necessary for conjunctivitis. However, newborns with ophthalmia neonatorum must be treated immediately to prevent blindness."
5447,What to expect if I have Pinkeye  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome is usually good with treatment. Conjunctivitis resolves, in 65% of cases, within 2 – 5 days."
5448,What are the symptoms of a pterygium?,"The primary symptom of a pterygium is a painless area of elevated whitish-pinkish tissue, with blood vessels on the inner or outer edge of the cornea."
5449,What are the causes of a pterygium?,"Scientists do not know what causes pterygia to develop. However, since people who have pterygia usually have spent a significant time outdoors, many doctors believe ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun may be a factor."
5450,Who is at highest risk for Pterygium ?,"Pterygia are more common in people in the 20-40 age group that live in sunny, dry climates. Additionally, chronic dry eye is believed to contribute to pterygium. Risk factors are exposure to sunny, dusty, sandy, or windblown areas. As a result, farmers, fishermen, and people living near the equator are often affected. While some studies report a higher prevalence of pterygia in men than in women, this may reflect different rates of exposure to UV light. Pterygium is rarely observed in children."
5451,How to know you have a pterygium?,A physical examination of the eyes and eyelids confirms the diagnosis. Special tests are usually not necessary.
5452,What are the causes of Red eye ?,"Bloodshot eyes appear red because the vessels in the surface of the white portion of the eye (sclera) become swollen. This may result from dry air, too much sun, dust, something in the eye, allergies, infection, or injury.
One common cause of a red eye is straining or coughing. This can lead to a bright red, dense bloody area on the white part of the eye. This is called a sub-conjunctival hemorrhage. Although this bloody area may appear alarming, it is a fairly common occurrence and of little significance. If you notice a bloody spot in one eye that doesn't hurt, but just looks bad, don't worry. It should clear up on its own within a week or two.
Eye infections or inflammation can occur, causing redness as well as possibly itching, discharge, pain, or vision problems.
Blepharitis: Swelling of the eyelash along the edge of the eyelid.
Conjunctivitis: Swelling or infection of the tissue that lines the eyelids and coats the surface of the eye (the conjunctiva). This is often referred to as ""pink eye.""
Corneal ulcers: Ulcers on the outer covering of the eye, usually because of a bacterial or viral infection.
Uveitis: Swelling of the uvea, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. This is often related to an autoimmune disorder, infection, or exposure to toxins. Often, only the iris is inflamed, which is called iritis.
Other potential causes include:
Cold or allergies
Acute glaucoma -- a sudden increase in eye pressure that is extremely painful and causes serious visual disturbances. This is a medical emergency. Most times, glaucoma is chronic and gradual
Corneal scratches caused by sand, dust, or overuse of contacts"
5453,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Red eye ?,"Go to the hospital or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if:
Your eye is red after a penetrating injury. You have a headache along with blurred vision or confusion. You are seeing halos around lights. You have nausea and vomiting.
Call your health care provider if:
Your eyes are red longer than 1-2 days. You have eye pain or vision changes. You take blood thinning medication, like warfarin. You may have an object in your eye. You are very sensitive to light. You have a yellow or greenish discharge from one or both eyes."
5454,What are the symptoms of Strabismus?,"Symptoms of strabismus may be present all the time, or only when you are tired or sick.
The eyes do not move together and may appear crossed at times.
The other eye will appear turned out, up, or down from wherever the first eye is focused.
Someone with strabismus may also have:
Depth perception loss Double vision Vision loss"
5455,What causes Strabismus?,"Six different muscles surround the eyes and work ""as a team"" so that both eyes can focus on the same object.
In someone with strabismus, these muscles do not work together. As a result, one eye looks at one object, while the other eye turns in a different direction and is focused on another object.
When this occurs, two different images are sent to the brain -- one from each eye. This confuses the brain, and the brain may learn to ignore the image from the weaker eye.
If the strabismus is not treated, the eye that the brain ignores will never see well. This loss of vision is called amblyopia. Another name for amblyopia is ""lazy eye."" Sometimes amblyopia is present first, and it causes strabismus.
In most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown. In more than half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth (congenital strabismus).
Most of the time, the problem has to do with muscle control, and not with muscle strength.
Less often, problems with one of the nerves or muscles, or Graves' disease restriction may cause strabismus.
Other disorders associated with strabismus include:
Brain and nerve disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or Guillain-Barre syndrome Diabetes (causes a condition known as acquired paralytic strabismus) Damage to the retina in children who are born premature Hemangioma near the eye during infancy Injuries to the eye Tumor in the brain or eye Vision loss from any eye disease or injury"
5456,Who is at highest risk for Strabismus ?,"A family history of strabismus is a risk factor. Farsightedness may be a contributing factor, especially in children. Any other disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus."
5457,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Strabismus ?,"Strabismus requires prompt medical evaluation. Call for an appointment with your health care provider or eye doctor if your child:
Appears to be cross-eyed Complains of double vision Has difficulty seeing
Note: Learning difficulties or problems at school can sometimes be due to a child's inability to see the blackboard or reading material."
5458,What to expect if I have Strabismus  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"After surgery, the eyes may look straight but vision problems can remain.
The child may still have reading problems in school, and for adults driving may be more difficult. Vision may affect the ability to play sports.
With early diagnosis and treatment, the problem can usually be corrected. Delayed treatment may lead to permanent vision loss in one eye. About one-third of children with strabismus will develop amblyopia.
Because many children will get strabismus or amblyopia again, they need to be monitored closely."
5459,What are the symptoms of a stye?,"In addition to the red, swollen bump, other possible symptoms include:
A gritty, scratchy sensation as if there is a foreign body Sensitivity to light Tearing of your eye Tenderness of the eyelid"
5460,What causes a stye?,"A stye is caused by bacteria from the skin that get into the oil glands in the eyelids that provide lubrication to the tear film. Styes are similar to common acne pimples that occur elsewhere on the skin. You may have more than one stye at the same time.
Styes usually develop over a few days and may drain and heal on their own. A stye can become a chalazion -- this is when an inflamed oil gland becomes fully blocked. If a chalazion gets large enough, it can cause trouble with your vision.
If you have blepharitis, you are more likely to get styes."
5461,Who is at highest risk for Stye ?,People with blepharitis.
5462,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stye ?,"Call your doctor if:
You have problems with your vision. The eyelid bump worsens or does not improve within a week or two of self-care. The eyelid bump or bumps become very large or painful. You have a blister on your eyelid. You have crusting or scaling of your eyelids. Your whole eyelid is red, or the eye itself is red. You are very sensitive to light or have excessive tears. A stye comes back soon after successful treatment of another one. Your eyelid bump bleeds."
5463,What to expect if I have Stye  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Styes often get better on their own, although they may recur. The outcome is generally excellent with simple treatment.
Possible complications:
Recurrence of a stye Spread of infection to other eyelash follicles Spread of infection to the tissue of the eyelid (eyelid cellulitis)"
5464,What are the symptoms of Trachoma?,"Symptoms begin 5 to 12 days after being exposed to the bacteria. The condition begins slowly as inflammation of the tissue lining the eyelids (conjunctivitis, or ""pink eye""), which if untreated may lead to scarring.
Symptoms may include:
Cloudy cornea Discharge from the eye Swelling of lymph nodes just in front of the ears Swollen eyelids Turned-in eyelashes"
5465,What causes Trachoma?,"Trachoma is caused by infection with the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis.
The condition occurs worldwide, mostly in rural settings in developing countries. It frequently affects children, although the effects of scarring may not be seen until later in life. While trachoma is rare in the United States, certain populations marked by poverty, crowded living conditions, or poor hygiene are at higher risk for this illness.
Trachoma is spread through direct contact with infected eye, nose, or throat secretions or by contact with contaminated objects, such as towels or clothes. Certain flies can also spread the bacteria."
5466,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Trachoma ?,Call your health care provider if you or your child recently visited an area of the world where trachoma is common and there are symptoms of conjunctivitis.
5467,What to expect if I have Trachoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Early treatment before the development of scarring and lid deformities has an excellent prognosis.
5468,What are the symptoms of Acute upper airway obstruction?,"Symptoms vary depending on the cause, but some symptoms are common to all types of airway blockage. They include:
Agitation or fidgeting Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) Changes in consciousness Choking Confusion Difficulty breathing Gasping for air Panic Unconsciousness Wheezing, crowing, whistling, or other unusual breathing noises indicating breathing difficulty"
5469,What causes Acute upper airway obstruction?,"Causes of acute upper airway obstruction include:

5470,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute upper airway obstruction ?,"Airway obstruction is an emergency. It is a good idea to learn how to clear an airway of a foreign body by using a method such as the Heimlich maneuver.
Diseases in which airway obstruction develops over a period of hours will allow time to get to a hospital. If an acute airway obstruction occurs, call 911 or your local emergency number for medical help. Do what you can to maintain breathing until medical help arrives."
5471,What to expect if I have Acute upper airway obstruction  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Prompt treatment is often successful. However, the condition is dangerous and may be fatal, even if treated."
5472,What are the symptoms of Airway obstruction?,"Symptoms vary depending on the cause, but some symptoms are common to all types of airway blockage. They include:
Agitation or fidgeting. Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) Changes in consciousness. Choking. Confusion. Difficulty breathing. Gasping for air. Panic. Unconsciousness. Wheezing, crowing, whistling, or other unusual breathing noises indicating breathing difficulty."

5476,What are the symptoms of Amelogenesis imperfecta?,The enamel of the tooth is soft and thin. The teeth appear yellow and are easily damaged. Both baby teeth and permanent teeth are affected.
5477,What causes Amelogenesis imperfecta?,Amelogenesis imperfecta is passed down through families as a dominant trait. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order for you to get the disease.
5478,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Amelogenesis imperfecta ?,Call your dentist if you have symptoms of this condition.
5479,What to expect if I have Amelogenesis imperfecta  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Treatment is often successful in protecting the teeth.
5480,What are the symptoms of Anaplastic thyroid cancer?,"Coughing up blood Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness or changing the voice Loud breathing Lower neck mass, often noted to be rapidly enlarging"
5481,What causes Anaplastic thyroid cancer?,Genetic mutation is suspected to be the main cause of anaplastic thyroid cancer.
5482,Who is at highest risk for Anaplastic thyroid cancer ?,A history of goiter Family history of thyroid disease Female gender Asian race Age between 25 and 65 years old. Exposure to radiation to the head and neck as an infant or child or being exposed to radioactive fallout
5483,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anaplastic thyroid cancer ?,"Call your health care provider if there is a persistent lump or mass in the neck, hoarseness, changing voice, cough, or coughing up blood."
5484,What to expect if I have Anaplastic thyroid cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The prognosis of this disease is poor. Most people do not survive longer than 6 months due to the aggressive nature of this disease and lack of effective treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: The age at the time of diagnosis The stage of the cancer The patient's general health
5485,What are the symptoms of Benign positional vertigo?,"The main symptom is a spinning sensation, which:
Is usually triggered by head movement Often starts suddenly Lasts a few minutes or less
Most often, patients say they cannot roll in bed or tilt their head up to look at something.
Other symptoms can include:
Vision complaints, such as a perception that things are jumping or moving Vomiting (in severe cases)"
5486,What causes Benign positional vertigo?,"Benign positional vertigo is due to a disturbance within the inner ear. The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. The canals are very sensitive to movement of the fluid, which occurs as you change position. The fluid movement allows your brain to interpret your body's position and maintain your balance.
Benign positional vertigo develops when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats within the tube of the inner ear. This sends the brain confusing messages about your body's position."
5487,Who is at highest risk for Benign positional vertigo (paitent information)?,"There are no major risk factors. However, the condition may partly run in families. A prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head) or an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis may make some people more likely to develop the condition."
5488,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Benign positional vertigo (paitent information)?,"Call your health care provider if vertigo develops that has not been evaluated or if treatment is ineffective. Also call if you develop any associated symptoms (such as weakness, slurred speech, visual problems) that may indicate a more serious condition."
5489,What to expect if I have Benign positional vertigo (paitent information) (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Benign positional vertigo is uncomfortable, but usually improves with time. This condition may occur again without warning."
5490,What are the symptoms of Bleeding esophageal varices?,"People with chronic liver disease and esophageal varices may have no symptoms.
If there is only a small amount of bleeding, the only symptom may be dark or black streaks in the stools.
If larger amounts of bleeding occur, symptoms may include:
Black, tarry stools Bloody stools Light-headedness Paleness Symptoms of chronic liver disease (such as cirrhosis) Vomiting Vomiting blood"
5491,What causes Bleeding esophageal varices?,"Scarring (cirrhosis) of the liver is the most common cause of esophageal varices. This scarring prevents blood from flowing through the liver. As a result, more blood flows through the veins of the esophagus.
This extra blood flow causes the veins in the esophagus to balloon outward. If these veins break open (rupture), they can cause severe bleeding.
The swollen veins (varices) can also occur in the upper part of the stomach."
5492,Who is at highest risk for Bleeding esophageal varices ?,Any cause of chronic liver disease can cause varices.
5493,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bleeding esophageal varices ?,Call your health care provider or go to an emergency room if you vomit blood or have black tarry stools.
5494,What to expect if I have Bleeding esophageal varices  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Bleeding often comes back without treatment. Bleeding esophageal varices are a serious complication of liver disease and have a poor outcome.
5495,What are the symptoms of Breath odor?,"Some disorders will produce specific, characteristic odors to the breath.
Bad breath related to poor oral hygiene is most common and caused by release of sulphur compounds by bacteria in the mouth.
A fruity odor to the breath occurs as the body attempts to get rid of excess acetone through the breathing. This is a sign of ketoacidosis, which may occur in diabetes. It is a potentially life-threatening condition.
Breath that smells like feces can occur with prolonged vomiting, especially when there is a bowel obstruction. It may also occur temporarily if a person has a tube placed through the nose or mouth to the stomach to drain the stomach contents (nasogastric tube) in place.
The breath may have an ammonia-like odor (also described as urine-like or ""fishy"") in people with chronic kidney failure."
5496,What causes Breath odor?,"If previously normal breath turns into halitosis, causes could include:
Abscessed tooth Alcoholism Cavities Dentures Drugs
Paraldehyde Triamterene and inhaled anesthetics Insulin - injection
Food or beverages consumed (such as cabbage, garlic, raw onions, or coffee) Foreign body in the nose (usually in children)
Often (but not always) there is a white, yellowish, or bloody discharge from one nostril
Gum disease (gingivitis, gingivostomatitis) Impacted tooth Lung infection Poor dental hygiene Sinusitis Throat infection Tobacco smoking Vitamin supplements (especially in large doses)
Diseases that may be associated with breath odor (not presented in order of likelihood -- some are extremely unlikely):
Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis Acute necrotizing ulcerative mucositis Acute renal failure Bowel obstruction (can cause breath to smell like feces) Bronchiectasis Chronic renal failure (can cause breath to smell like ammonia) Diabetes (fruity or sweet chemical smell with ketoacidosis) Esophageal cancer Gastric carcinoma Gastrojejunocolic fistula (fruity-smelling breath) Hepatic encephalopathy Diabetic ketoacidosis Lung abscess Ozena, or atrophic rhinitis Periodontal disease Pharyngitis Zenker's diverticulum"
5497,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Breathe odor ?,"Breath odor persists and there is not an obvious cause (such as smoking or eating odor-causing foods). You have breath odor and signs of a respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or face pain with discharge from the nose"
5498,What to expect if I have Breathe odor  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Your doctor will take a medical history and perform a physical examination.
You may be asked the following medical history questions:
Is there a specific odor? Is there a fishy smell? Does the breath smell like ammonia or urine? Does the breath smell like fruit or is there a sweet-chemical smell? Does the breath smell like feces? Does the breath smell like alcohol? Have you recently eaten a spicy meal, garlic, cabbage, or other ""odorous"" food? Do you take vitamin supplements? Do you smoke? Does good oral hygiene improve the odor? What home care measures have you tried? How effective are they? Is there a recent sore throat, sinus infection, tooth abscess, or other illness? What other symptoms do you have?
The physical examination will include a thorough examination of the mouth and the nose. A throat culture may be taken if you have a sore throat or mouth sores.
In rare cases, diagnostic tests that may be performed include:
Blood tests to screen for diabetes or kidney failure Endoscopy (EGD) X-ray of the abdomen X-ray of the chest
Antibiotics may be prescribed for some conditions. For an object in the nose, the doctor will use an instrument to remove it."
5499,What are the symptoms of Candida esophagitis?,"Symptoms include:
Difficulty swallowing Fever (only if the fungus spreads further) Oral thrush (Candida in the mouth) Painful swallowing"
5500,What causes Candida esophagitis?,Candida esophagitis is caused by the yeast Candida. It occurs when the yeast spreads from the mouth down the esophagus.
5501,Who is at highest risk for Candida esophagitis ?,"The condition is often a sign of a weakened immune system. The following raise your risk for Candida infections:
HIV/AIDS Chemotherapy Diabetes Leukemia or lymphoma Organ transplants Other conditions that suppress or weaken the immune system
If you have a weakened immune system, thrush in the mouth (oral thrush) makes you more likely to get Candida esophagitis."
5502,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Candida esophagitis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of esophagitis, especially if you know that you are immunosuppressed."
5503,What to expect if I have Candida esophagitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Esophagitis can usually be treated effectively. The outcome depends on the immune system problem that makes the person develop the infection.
5504,What are the symptoms of Cavernous sinus thrombosis?,Bulging eyeballs Cannot move the eye in a particular direction Drooping eyelids Headaches Vision loss
5505,What causes Cavernous sinus thrombosis?,"The cause of cavernous sinus thrombosis is usually a bacterial infection that has spread from the sinuses, teeth, ears, eyes, nose, or skin of the face."
5506,Who is at highest risk for Cavernous sinus thrombosis ?,Persons with conditions that cause an increased risk of blood clots may also develop cavernous sinus thrombosis.
5507,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cavernous sinus thrombosis ?,"Call your doctor right away if you have:
Bulging of your eyes Drooping eyelids Eye pain Inability to move your eye in any particular direction Vision loss"
5508,What to expect if I have Cavernous sinus thrombosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cavernous sinus thrombosis can be fatal. However, the death rate of this condition has improved tremendously since the introduction of antibiotics."
5509,What are the symptoms of Choanal atresia?,"Newborns generally prefer to breathe through their nose. Typically, infants only mouth breathe when they cry. Babies with choanal atresia have difficulty breathing unless they are crying.
Choanal atresia may affect one or both sides of the nasal airway. Choanal atresia blocking both sides (bilateral) of the nose causes acute breathing problems with cyanosis and breathing failure. Infants with bilateral choanal atresia may need resuscitation at delivery. More than half of infants have a blockage on only one side, which causes less severe problems.
Symptoms include:
Chest retracts unless the child is breathing through mouth or crying Difficulty breathing following birth, which may result in cyanosis (bluish discoloration), unless infant is crying Inability to nurse and breathe at same time Inability to pass a catheter through each side of the nose into the throat Persistent one-sided nasal blockage or discharge"
5510,What causes Choanal atresia?,The cause of choanal atresia is unknown. It is thought to occur when the thin tissue separating the nose and mouth area during fetal development remains after birth.
5511,Who is at highest risk for Choanal atresia ?,"The condition is the most common nasal abnormality in newborn infants, affecting about 1 in 7,000 live births. Females get this condition about twice as often as males. More than half of affected infants also have other congenital problems.
Choanal atresia is generally diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital."
5512,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Choanal atresia ?,"Choanal atresia, especially when it affects both sides, is generally diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital. One-sided atresia may not cause symptoms, and the infant may be sent home without a diagnosis.
If your infant has any of the problems listed here, consult your health care provider. The child may need to be checked by an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist."
5513,What to expect if I have Choanal atresia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Full recovery is expected.
5514,What are the symptoms of Cholesteatoma?,Dizziness Drainage from the ear Hearing loss in one ear
5515,What causes Cholesteatoma?,"Poor function in the eustachian tube leads to negative pressure in the middle ear. This pulls a part of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) into the middle ear, creating a pocket or cyst that fills with old skin cells and other waste material. The cyst can become infected. The cyst may get bigger and break down some of the middle ear bones or other structures of the ear, affecting hearing, balance, and possibly function of the facial muscles."
5516,Who is at highest risk for Cholesteatoma ?,"Cholesteatoma can be a birth defect (congenital), but it more commonly occurs as a complication of chronic ear infection."
5517,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cholesteatoma ?,"Call your health care provider if ear pain, drainage from the ear, or other symptoms occur or worsen, or if hearing loss occurs."
5518,What to expect if I have Cholesteatoma  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cholesteatomas usually continue to grow if not removed. Surgery usually works, but you may occasionally need the ear cleaned by a health care provider. Additional surgery may be needed if the cholesteatoma comes back."
5519,What are the symptoms of Cleft lip and palate?,"A child may have one or more of these conditions at birth.
A cleft lip may be just a small notch in the lip. It may also be a complete split in the lip that goes all the way to the base of the nose.
A cleft palate can be on one or both sides of the roof of the mouth. It may go the full length of the palate.
Other symptoms include:
Misaligned teeth Change in nose shape (amount of distortion varies)
Problems that may be present because of a cleft lip or palate are:
Failure to gain weight Feeding problems Flow of milk through nasal passages during feeding Misaligned teeth Poor growth Recurrent ear infections Speech difficulties"
5520,What causes Cleft lip and palate?,"There are many causes for of cleft lip and palate. Problems with genes passed down from one or both parents, drugs, viruses, or other toxins can all cause such birth defects. Cleft lip and palate may occur along with other syndromes or birth defects.
A cleft lip and palate can affect the appearance of one's face, and may lead to problems with feeding and speech, as well as ear infections. Problems may range from a small notch in the lip to a complete groove that runs into the roof of the mouth and nose. These features may occur separately or together."
5521,Who is at highest risk for Cleft lip and palate ?,"Risk factors include:
a family history of cleft lip or palate other birth defect
About 1 out of 2,500 people have a cleft palate."
5522,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cleft lip and palate ?,Cleft lip and palate is usually diagnosed at birth. Follow the health care provider's recommendations for follow-up visits. Call if problems develop between visits.
5523,What to expect if I have Cleft lip and palate  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Although treatment may continue for several years and require several surgeries, most children with a cleft lip and palate can achieve normal appearance, speech, and eating. However, some people may have continued speech problems."
5524,What are the symptoms of CMV esophagitis?,"Symptoms include:
Difficult and painful swallowing Low-grade fever Mouth sores (oral lesions)"
5525,What causes CMV esophagitis?,CMV esophagitis is caused by the cytomegalovirus (CMV).
5526,Who is at highest risk for CMV esophagitis ?,"The condition is often a sign of a weakened immune system. The following conditions raise your risk for CMV infections:
HIV/AIDS Chemotherapy Diabetes Leukemia or lymphoma Organ transplants Other conditions that suppress or weaken your immune system"
5527,When to seek urgent medical care when I have CMV esophagitis ?,"Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of CMV esophagitis, especially if you have a suppressed immune system."
5528,What to expect if I have CMV esophagitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Esophagitis can usually be treated effectively. The outcome depends on the immune system problem that makes the person more likely to get the infection.
5529,What are the symptoms of Dental cavities?,"There may be no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include:
Tooth pain or achy feeling, particularly after sweet, hot, or cold foods and drinks Visible pits or holes in the teeth"
5530,What causes Dental cavities?,"Tooth decay is one of the most common of all disorders, second only to the common cold.
Bacteria are normally present in the mouth. The bacteria convert all foods -- especially sugar and starch -- into acids. Bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine in the mouth to form a sticky substance called plaque that adheres to the teeth. It is most prominent on the back molars, just above the gum line on all teeth, and at the edges of fillings. Plaque that is not removed from the teeth mineralizes into tartar. Plaque and tartar irritate the gums, resulting in gingivitis and ultimately periodontitis.
Plaque begins to build up on teeth within 20 minutes after eating (the time when most bacterial activity occurs). If this plaque is not removed thoroughly and routinely, tooth decay will not only begin, but flourish.
The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the tooth and create holes in the tooth (cavities). Cavities are usually painless until they grow very large and affect nerves or cause a tooth fracture. If left untreated, a tooth abscess can develop. Untreated tooth decay also destroys the internal structures of the tooth (pulp) and ultimately causes the loss of the tooth."
5531,Who is at highest risk for Dental cavities ?,"It usually occurs in children and young adults but can affect any person. It is a common cause of tooth loss in younger people.
Carbohydrates (sugars and starches) increase the risk of tooth decay. Sticky foods are more harmful than nonsticky foods because they remain on the surface of the teeth. Frequent snacking increases the time that acids are in contact with the surface of the tooth."
5532,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dental cavities ?,"Call your dentist if you have a toothache.
Make an appointment with your dentist for a routine cleaning and examination if you have not had one in the last 6 months to 1 year."
5533,What to expect if I have Dental cavities  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Treatment often saves the tooth. Early treatment is less painful and less expensive than treatment of extensive decay.
You may need numbing medicine (lidocaine), nitrous oxide (laughing gas), or other prescription medications to relieve pain during or after drilling or dental work.
Nitrous oxide with Novocaine may be preferred if you are afraid of dental treatments."
5534,What are the symptoms of Drooling?,"Drooling is generally caused by:
Problems keeping saliva in the mouth Problems with swallowing Too much saliva production
Some people with drooling problems are at increased risk of breathing saliva, food, or fluids into the lungs. This may cause harm if there is a problem with the body's normal reflexes (such as gagging and coughing).
Drooling caused by nervous system (neurologic) problems can often be managed with drugs that block the action of the chemical messenger acetylcholine (anticholinergic drugs). In severe cases, people can reduce drooling by injecting botulism toxin, getting high-energy x-rays (radiation) to the glands in the mouth that make saliva (salivary glands), and other methods."
5535,What causes Drooling?,"Some drooling in infants and toddlers is normal and is not usually a sign of a disease or other problem. It may occur with teething. Drooling in infants and young children may get worse with upper respiratory infections and nasal allergies.
Drooling that occurs with fever or trouble swallowing may be a sign of a more serious disease, including:
Mononucleosis Peritonsillar abscess Retropharyngeal abscess Strep throat Tonsillitis
Sudden drooling may occur with poisoning (especially by pesticides) or a reaction to snake or insect venom.
Other things that can cause drooling:
Certain medications Nervous system (neurological) problems"
5536,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Drooling ?,"Call your health care provider if:
The cause of the drooling has not been diagnosed. There is concern about aspiration. Your child has a fever, difficulty breathing, or holds his or her head in a strange position."
5537,What to expect if I have Drooling  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The doctor will do a physical examination and ask questions about the symptoms, including:
Is there a history of any other diseases? Has the person had a bite or sting? Has the person had an injury? What medications is the person taking? What other symptoms are present (such as fever, sore throat, facial droop)?
The tests performed depend on the symptoms that occur with the drooling."
5538,What are the symptoms of Ear infection-acute?,"In infants, the main sign is often irritability and inconsolable crying. Many infants and children with an acute ear infection have a fever or trouble sleeping. Tugging on the ear is not always a sign that the child has an ear infection.
Symptoms of an acute ear infection in older children or adults include:
Ear pain or earache Fullness in the ear Feeling of general illness Vomiting Diarrhea Hearing loss in the affected ear
The ear infection may start shortly after having a cold. Sudden drainage of yellow or green fluid from the ear may mean a ruptured eardrum.
All acute ear infections include fluid behind the eardrum. You can use an electronic ear monitor, such as EarCheck, to detect this fluid at home. The device is available at pharmacies, but you still need to see your doctor to confirm any possible ear infection."
5539,What causes Ear infection-acute?,"The Eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid normally made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection.
Ear infections are common in infants and children, because the eustachian tubes become easily clogged.
Ear infections may also occur in adults, although they are less common than in children.
Anything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked causes more fluids to build up in the middle ear behind the eardrum. These causes include:
Allergies Colds and sinus infections Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething Infected or overgrown adenoids Tobacco smoke or other irritants
Ear infections are also more likely if a child spends a lot of time drinking from a sippy cup or bottle while lying on his or her back. However, getting water in the ears will not cause an acute ear infection, unless the eardrum has a hole from a previous episode.
Acute ear infections occur most often in the winter. You cannot catch an ear infection from someone else, but a cold may spread among children and cause some of them to get ear infections."
5540,Who is at highest risk for Ear infection-acute ?,"Risk factors for acute ear infections include:
Attending daycare (especially those with more than 6 children) Changes in altitude or climate Cold climate Exposure to smoke Genetic factors (susceptibility to infection may run in families) Not being breastfed Pacifier use Recent ear infection Recent illness of any type (lowers resistance of the body to infection)"
5541,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ear infection-acute ?,"Call your child's doctor if:
Pain, fever, or irritability do not improve within 24 to 48 hours At the start, the child seems sicker than just an ear infection Your child has a high fever or severe pain Severe pain suddenly stops hurting -- this may indicate a ruptured eardrum Symptoms worsen New symptoms appear, especially severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles
For a child younger than 6 months, let the doctor know right away if the child has a fever, even if no other symptoms are present."
5542,What to expect if I have Ear infection-acute  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Ear infections can be treated but may occur again in the future. They can be quite painful. If you or your child are prescribed an antibiotic, it is important to finish all your medication as instructed."
5543,What are the symptoms of an Ear infection-chronic?,"A chronic, long-term infection in the ear may have less severe symptoms than an acute infection. It may go unnoticed and untreated for a long time.
Symptoms may include:
Ear pain or discomfort that is usually mild and feels like pressure in the ear Fever, usually low-grade Fussiness in young infants Pus-like drainage from the ear Hearing loss
Note: Symptoms may persists or come and go, and may occur in one or both ears."
5544,What causes an Ear infection-chronic?,"The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid normally made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. When this happens, infection can occur. See: Acute ear infection
A chronic ear infection occurs when fluid or an infection behind the eardrum does not go away. A chronic ear infection may be caused by:
An acute ear infection that does not clear completely Repeated ear infections
""Suppurative chronic otitis"" is a phrase doctors use to describe an eardrum that keeps rupturing, draining, or swelling in the middle ear or mastoid area and does not go away."
5545,Who is at highest risk for Ear infection-chronic ?,"Ear infections are more common in children because their Eustachian tubes are shorter, narrower, and more horizontal than in adults. Chronic ear infections are much less common than acute ear infections."
5546,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ear infection-chronic ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You or your child has signs of a chronic ear infection An ear infection does not respond to treatment New symptoms develop during or after treatment"
5547,What to expect if I have Ear infection-chronic  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Chronic ear infections usually respond to treatment. However, your child may need to keep taking medicines for several months.
Chronic ear infections are not life threatening, but they can be uncomfortable and may result in hearing loss and other serious complications."
5548,What are the symptoms of Otalgia?,"The symptoms of an ear infection may include:
Ear pain Fever Fussiness Increased crying Irritability
Many children will have temporary and minor hearing loss during, and right after, an ear infection. Permanent hearing loss is rare, but the risk increases with the number of infections."
5549,What causes Otalgia?,"The eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is normally made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection.
Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. What you think is ear pain may actually be coming from another location, such as your temporomandibular joint, your teeth, throat, or other location. This is called ""referred"" pain.
Causes of ear pain may include:
Arthritis of the jaw Acute ear infection Chronic ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or severely impacted ear wax Ruptured or perforated eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat with referred pain to the ears Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection
Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection, or the following causes:
Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in the ear"
5550,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Earache ?,"Call your doctor if:
Your child has a high fever or severe pain or seems sicker than is usual for an ear infection. New symptoms appear, especially: Dizziness Severe headache Swelling around the ear Weakness of the face muscles
Severe pain suddenly stops; this may be a sign of a ruptured eardrum.
Symptoms (pain, fever, or irritability) get worse or do not improve within 24 - 48 hours."
5551,What to expect if I have Earache  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The doctor will do a physical examination, and examine the ear, nose, and throat areas.
Pain, tenderness, or redness of the mastoid bone behind the ear on the skull is often a sign of a serious infection."
5552,What are the symptoms of Gum disease?,"Bleeding gums (blood on toothbrush even with gentle brushing of the teeth) Bright red or red-purple appearance to gums Gums that are tender when touched, but otherwise painless Mouth sores Swollen gums Shiny appearance to gums"
5553,What causes Gum disease?,"Gingivitis is a form of periodontal disease. Periodontal disease involves inflammation and infection that destroys the tissues that support the teeth, including the gums, the periodontal ligaments, and the tooth sockets (alveolar bone).
Gingivitis is due to the long-term effects of plaque deposits. Plaque is a sticky material made of bacteria, mucus, and food debris that develops on the exposed parts of the teeth. It is a major cause of tooth decay. If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. Bacteria and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become infected, swollen, and tender.
Injury to the gums from any cause, including overly vigorous brushing or flossing of the teeth, can cause gingivitis.
The following raise your risk for developing gingivitis:
General illness Poor dental hygiene Pregnancy (hormonal changes increase the sensitivity of the gums) Uncontrolled diabetes
Misaligned teeth, rough edges of fillings, and ill-fitting or unclean mouth appliances (such as braces, dentures, bridges, and crowns) can irritate the gums and increase the risk of gingivitis.
Medications such as phenytoin and birth control pills, and heavy metals such as lead and bismuth are also associated with gingivitis."
5554,Who is at highest risk for Gingivitis ?,"Many people have gingivitis to a varying degree. It usually develops during puberty or early adulthood due to hormonal changes and may persist or recur frequently, depending on the health of your teeth and gums."
5555,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Gingivitis ?,"Call your dentist if symptoms of gingivitis are present, especially if you have not had a routine cleaning and examination in the last 6 months.
Call your health care provider if the dentist recommends medical treatment of underlying conditions that contribute to the development of gingivitis."
5556,What to expect if I have Gingivitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The removal of plaque from inflamed gums may be uncomfortable. Bleeding and tenderness of the gums should lessen within 1 or 2 weeks after professional cleaning and careful oral hygiene. Warm salt water or antibacterial rinses can reduce the puffiness. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications will ease any discomfort from a rigorous cleaning.
Healthy gums are pink and firm in appearance. Strict oral hygiene must be maintained for your whole life or gingivitis will recur."
5557,What are the symptoms of Glossopharyngeal neuralgia?,"Symptoms include severe pain in areas connected to the ninth cranial nerve:
Back of the nose and throat (nasopharynx) Back of the tongue Ear Throat Tonsil area Voice box (larynx)
The pain occurs in episodes and may be severe. It is usually on one side, and feels jabbing. The episodes can occur many times each day, and awaken the person from sleep.
It can sometimes be triggered by:
Chewing Coughing Laughing Speaking Swallowing"
5558,What causes Glossopharyngeal neuralgia?,"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is believed to be caused by irritation of the ninth cranial nerve, called the glossopharyngeal nerve.
In most cases, the source of irritation is never found. Some possible causes for this type of nerve pain (neuralgia) are:
Blood vessels pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve Growths at the base of the skull pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve Tumors or infections of the throat and mouth pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve"
5559,Who is at highest risk for Glossopharyngeal neuralgia ?,Symptoms usually begin in people over age 40.
5560,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Glossopharyngeal neuralgia ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of glossopharyngeal neuralgia. See a pain specialist if the pain is severe to be sure that you are aware of all your options for controlling pain.
5561,What to expect if I have Glossopharyngeal neuralgia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,How well you do depends on the cause of the problem and the effectiveness of the first treatment. Surgery is considered effective for people who do not benefit from medications.
5562,What are the symptoms of Gum disease?,"Bleeding gums (blood on toothbrush even with gentle brushing of the teeth) Bright red or red-purple appearance to gums Gums that are tender when touched, but otherwise painless Mouth sores Swollen gums Shiny appearance to gums"

Healthy gums are pink and firm in appearance. Strict oral hygiene must be maintained for your whole life or gingivitis will recur."
5567,What are the causes of Halitosis?,"If previously normal breath turns into halitosis, causes could include:
Abscessed tooth Alcoholism Cavities Dentures Drugs Paraldehyde Triamterene and inhaled anesthetics Insulin - injection Food or beverages consumed (such as cabbage, garlic, raw onions, or coffee) Foreign body in the nose (usually in children) Often (but not always) there is a white, yellowish, or bloody discharge from one nostril Gum disease (gingivitis, gingivostomatitis) Impacted tooth Lung infection Poor dental hygiene Sinusitis Throat infection Tobacco smoking Vitamin supplements (especially in large doses)"
5568,Who is at highest risk for Halitosis ?,Smokers Alcoholics
5569,How to know you have Halitosis?,The air you breathe out has an unpleasant odor. Bad breath is frequently diagnosed by people in close proximity to you.
5570,What are the symptoms of Hearing loss in infants?,"Signs of hearing loss in infants vary by age. For example:
A newborn baby with hearing loss may not startle when a loud noise sounds nearby. Older infants, who should be responding to familiar voices, may show no reaction when spoken to. Children should be using single words by 15 months, and simple 2-word sentences by age 2. If they do not reach these milestones, hearing loss since infancy may be the cause.
Some children may not be diagnosed until they are in school. This is true even if they were born with hearing loss. Inattention and falling behind in class work may be the result of an undiagnosed hearing loss problem."
5571,What causes Hearing loss in infants?,"Hearing loss can develop in children who had normal hearing as infants. The loss can occur in one or both ears, and may be mild, moderate, severe, or profound. Profound hearing loss is what most people call deafness.
Some cases of hearing loss are progressive (they get worse over time). Other cases of hearing loss stay stable and do not get worse.
There are four types of hearing loss:
Conductive hearing loss (CHL) Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) Mixed hearing loss Central hearing loss
Conductive hearing loss results from a problem in the outer or middle ear, such as wax buildup, rupture of the eardrum, or repeated infections. It is usually possible to treat conductive hearing loss with medication or surgery.
Causes of conductive hearing loss in infants include:
Abnormalities in the structure of the ear canal or middle ear Buildup of ear wax Ear infections (especially repeated infections) Foreign objects in the ear Injury Rupture of the eardrum Tumors
Sensorineural hearing loss results from a problem with the inner ear. The inner ear is responsible for sending signals to the auditory (hearing) nerve. There is no cure for sensorineural hearing loss. People with this type of hearing loss may benefit from hearing aids or a cochlear implant.
Causes of sensorineural hearing loss include:
Exposure to certain toxic chemicals or medications while in the womb or after birth Genetic changes or conditions, such as Down syndrome Infection before birth, including cytomegalovirus infection, or infection with German measles during the early stages of pregnancy Infections after birth, such as bacterial meningitis Problems with the structure of the inner ear
Mixed hearing loss is hearing loss that results from a combination of conductive and sensorineural problems. Causes of mixed hearing loss can include any combination of the above SNHL and CHL causes.
Central hearing loss results from damage to the auditory nerve itself, or the brain pathways that lead to the nerve. Central hearing loss is rare in infants and children.
Causes of central hearing loss include:
Diseases that affect the protective coating (myelin sheath) around nerve cells Tumors"
5572,Who is at highest risk for Hearing loss in infants ?,"Risk factors for infant hearing loss include:
Family history of hearing loss Infection with some viruses and bacteria Low birth weight Problems with the structure of the skull bones
About 2 - 3 infants out of every 1,000 live births will have some degree of hearing loss at birth."
5573,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hearing loss in infants ?,"Call your health care provider if your baby or young child displays signs of hearing loss, such as not reacting to loud noises, not making or mimicking noises, or not speaking at the expected age.
If your child has a cochlear implant, call your health care provider immediately if your child develops a fever, stiff neck, headache, or an ear infection."
5574,What to expect if I have Hearing loss in infants  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well your baby does depends on the cause and severity of the hearing loss. Advances in hearing aid technology and speech therapy allow many children to develop normal language skills at the same age as their peers with normal hearing. Even infants with profound hearing loss will do well with the right combination of treatments.
If the baby has a disorder that affects more than hearing, the prognosis depends on the particular disorder and what other effects it has on the body."
5575,What are the symptoms of Herpangina?,"Fever Headache Loss of appetite Sore throat, or painful swallowing Ulcers in the mouth and throat, and similar sores on the feet, hands, and buttocks
The ulcers usually have a white to whitish-gray base and a red border. They may be very painful. Generally, there are only a few sores."
5576,What causes Herpangina?,Herpangina is typically caused by Coxsackie group A viruses.
5577,Who is at highest risk for Herpangina ?,"The number of cases of herpangina is unknown, but it is a common childhood infection. It is most often seen in children ages 3 - 10, but it can occur in any age group. Cases of herpangina at school or in the neighborhood increase the chances that your child will develop the illness."
5578,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Herpangina ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Fever, sore throat, or mouth sores last for more than 5 days Your child is having trouble drinking liquids or looks dehydrated Fever becomes very high or does not go away"
5579,What to expect if I have Herpangina  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The illness normally clears up within a week.
5580,What are the symptoms of an Impacted tooth?,Bad breath Difficulty opening the mouth (occasionally) Pain or tenderness of the gums (gingiva) or jaw bone Prolonged headache or jaw ache Redness and swelling of the gums around the impacted tooth Swollen lymph nodes of the neck (occasionally) Unpleasant taste when biting down on or near the area Visible gap where a tooth did not emerge
5581,What causes an Impacted tooth?,"Teeth start to pass through the gums (emerge) during infancy, and again when the primary (baby) teeth are replaced by the permanent teeth. If a tooth fails to emerge, or emerges only partially, it is considered to be impacted.
An impacted tooth remains stuck in gum tissue or bone for various reasons. It may be that the area is just overcrowded and there's no room for the teeth to emerge. For example, the jaw may be too small to fit the wisdom teeth. Teeth may also become twisted, tilted, or displaced as they try to emerge, resulting in impacted teeth.
Impacted wisdom teeth are very common. They are often painless and cause no apparent trouble. However, some professionals believe an impacted tooth pushes on the next tooth, which pushes the next tooth, eventually causing a misalignment of the bite. A partially emerged tooth can trap food, plaque, and other debris in the soft tissue around it, leading to inflammation and tenderness of the gums and unpleasant mouth odor. This is called pericoronitis."
5582,Who is at highest risk for Impacted tooth ?,"The most common teeth to become impacted are the wisdom teeth (the third set of molars). They are the last teeth to emerge, usually between the ages of 17 and 21."
5583,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Impacted tooth ?,Call your dentist if there is an unemerged tooth (or partially emerged tooth) and pain in the gums or other symptoms have developed.
5584,What to expect if I have Impacted tooth  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Impacted teeth may cause no problems for some people and may never require treatment. Treatment is usually successful when it does cause symptoms.
It is often preferable to have wisdom teeth removed before age 30 due to the flexibility of bone, which will allow an easier removal and better healing. As a person ages, the bone becomes more rigid and complications can develop."
5585,What are the symptoms of Labyrinthitis?,"Abnormal sensation of movement (vertigo) Difficulty focusing the eyes because of involuntary eye movements Dizziness Hearing loss in one ear Loss of balance, such as falling toward one side Nausea and vomiting Ringing or other noises in the ears (tinnitus)"
5586,What causes Labyrinthitis?,"During labyrinthitis, the parts of the inner ear become irritated and inflamed. This interferes with their function, which includes the ability to keep your balance.
The following raise your risk for labyrinthitis:
Drinking large amounts of alcohol Fatigue History of allergies Recent viral illness, respiratory infection, or ear infection Smoking Stress Use of certain prescription or nonprescription drugs (especially aspirin)"
5587,Who is at highest risk for Labyrinthitis ?,"The are likely many causes of labyrinthitis. It commonly occurs after an ear infection (otitis media) or an upper respiratory infection. It may also occur after an allergy, cholesteatoma, or taking certain drugs that are dangerous to the inner ear."
5588,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Labyrinthitis ?,"Call your health care provider if dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance, or other symptoms of labyrinthitis are present. Also call if hearing loss occurs.
Urgent or emergency symptoms include double vision, weakness or paralysis, slurring of speech, convulsions, fainting, persistent vomiting, or vertigo accompanied by fever of more than 101 degrees Fahrenheit."
5589,What to expect if I have Labyrinthitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"If you have severe vomiting, you may be admitted to the hospital.
Severe symptoms usually go away within a week. Most patients are completely better within 2 to 3 months. Continued dizziness is more likely to last in older patients.
Hearing usually returns to normal. In some cases, hearing loss may be permanent."
5590,What are the symptoms of Leukoplakia?,"Sores usually develop on the tongue, but they may also appear on the insides of the cheek, or on the outer femal genitals. The most common symptoms of hairy leukoplakia are painless, fuzzy white patches on the side of the tongue.
The sores are:
Usually white or gray Sometimes red (called erythroplakia, a condition that can lead to cancer) Thick and slightly raised with a hard surface that can't be easily scraped off"
5591,What causes Leukoplakia?,"Leukoplakia mainly affects the mucus membranes of the mouth. It is thought to be caused by irritation, but the causes is not always known.
Irritation in the mouth may be caused by:
Rough teeth Rough places on dentures, fillings, and crowns Smoking or other tobacco use (smoker's keratosis), especially pipes Holding chewing tobacco or snuff in your mouth for a long period of time
""Hairy"" leukoplakia of the mouth is a different disorder that is seen mostly in HIV-positive people. It may be one of the first signs of HIV infection. It can also appear in other people whose immune system is not working well, such as after a bone marrow transplant. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, but is not harmful by itself. The most common symptoms of hairy leukoplakia are painless, fuzzy white patches on the side of the tongue."
5592,Who is at highest risk for Leukoplakia ?,The disorder is most common in elderly persons.
5593,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Leukoplakia ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have any lesions resembling leukoplakia or hairy leukoplakia.
5594,What to expect if I have Leukoplakia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Leukoplakia is usually harmless. Lesions often clear up in a few weeks or months after the source of irritation is removed.
Rarely, it may become cancer."
5595,What causes Mouth sores?,"Most mouth sores are cold sores (also called fever blisters), canker sores, or other irritation caused by:
A sharp or broken tooth or poorly fitting dentures Biting your cheek, tongue, or lip Burning your mouth from hot food or drinks Braces Chewing tobacco
Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus and are very contagious. Usually, you will have tenderness, tingling, or burning before the actual sore appears. Cold sores usually begin as blisters and then crust over.
The herpes virus can live in your body for years. It only appears as a mouth sore when something triggers it, such as:
Another illness, especially if there is a fever Hormone changes (such as menstruation) Stress Sun exposure
Canker sores are NOT contagious. They can appear as a single pale or yellow ulcer with a red outer ring, or as a cluster of these sores. The cause of canker sores is not clear, but may be related to:
A virus A temporary weakness in your immune system (for example, from the cold or flu) Hormone changes Irritation Stress Low levels of vitamin B12 or folate
Less commonly, mouth sores can be a sign of an illness, tumor, or reaction to a medication. Such illnesses can be grouped into several broad categories:
Autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus) Bleeding disorders Cancer Infection (such as hand-foot-mouth disease) Weakened immune system -- for example, if you have AIDS or are taking medication after a transplant
Drugs that may cause mouth sores include:
Aspirin Barbiturates (used for insomnia) Chemotherapy drugs for cancer Gold (used for rheumatoid arthritis) Penicillin Phenytoin (used for seizures) Streptomycin Sulfonamides"
5596,Who is at highest risk for Mouth sores ?,"For unknown reasons, women seem to get canker sores more often than men. This may be related to hormone changes."
5597,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mouth sores ?,"Call your doctor if:
The sore begins soon after you start a new medication You have large white patches on the roof of your mouth or your tongue (this may be thrush or another type of infection) Your mouth sore lasts longer than 2 weeks You have a weakened immune system (for example, from HIV or cancer) You have other symptoms like fever, skin rash, drooling, or difficulty swallowing"
5598,What to expect if I have Mouth sores  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Your doctor will perform a physical examination, focusing on your mouth and tongue. Medical history questions may include the following:
Are the sores on your lips, gums, tongue, lining of your cheeks, or elsewhere? Are the sores open ulcers? Are there large, white patches on the roof of the mouth or on your tongue? How long have you had the mouth sores? More than 2 weeks? Have you ever had sores of this type before? What medications do you take? Do you have other symptoms like fever, sore throat, or breath odor?
Treatment may depend on the cause of the mouth sore.
A topical anesthetic (applied to the skin) such as lidocaine or xylocaine may be used to relieve pain (but should be avoided in children). An antifungal medication may be prescribed for oral thrush (a yeast infection). An antiviral medication may be prescribed for herpes sores (although some experts don't believe medication will make the sores go away sooner) Anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed for severe or persistent canker sores."
5599,What are the symptoms of Mouth ulcers?,"Symptoms vary and depend on the specific cause of the mouth ulcer. In general, symptoms may include:
Open sores in the mouth Pain or discomfort in the mouth"
5600,What causes Mouth ulcers?,"Mouth ulcers are caused by many disorders. These include:
Canker sores Gingivostomatitis Herpes simplex (fever blister) Leukoplakia Oral cancer Oral lichen planus Oral thrush
The skin lesion of histoplasmosis may also appear as a mouth ulcer."
5601,Who is at highest risk for Mouth ulcers ?,"Individuals who have been diagnosed with these conditions may have a higher risk:
Canker sores Gingivostomatitis Herpes simplex (fever blister) Leukoplakia Oral cancer Oral lichen planus Oral thrush"
5602,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mouth ulcers ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if your mouth ulcers don't go away after 3 weeks. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if mouth ulcers return frequently, or if new symptoms develop."
5603,What to expect if I have Mouth ulcers  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome varies depending on the cause of the ulcer. Many mouth ulcers are harmless and heal without treatment.
There are types of cancer, however, that may first appear as a mouth ulcer that does not heal. See: Squamous cell carcinoma"
5604,What causes a Nosebleed?,"Allergic rhinitis An object stuck in the nose Barotrauma Blowing the nose very hard Chemical irritants Direct injury to nose, including a broken nose Nose picking Overuse of decongestant nasal sprays Repeated sneezing Surgery on the face or nose Taking large doses of aspirin or blood-thinning medicine Upper respiratory infection Very cold or very dry air
Repeated nosebleeds may be a symptom of another disease such as high blood pressure, allergies, a bleeding disorder, or a tumor of the nose or sinuses."
5605,Who is at highest risk for Nosebleed ?,"Occasionally, nosebleeds may indicate other disorders such as bleeding disorders or high blood pressure.
Frequent nosebleeds may also be a sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (also called HHT or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome).
Blood thinners such as Coumadin, Plavix, or aspirin may cause or worsen nosebleeds."
5606,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nosebleed ?,"Get emergency care if:
Bleeding does not stop after 20 minutes Nose bleeding occurs after an injury to the head -- this may suggest a skull fracture and x-rays should be taken Your nose may be broken (for example, it is misshapen after a blow or injury)
Call your doctor if you or your child has repeated nosebleeds, particularly if they are becoming more frequent and are not associated with a cold or other minor irritation."
5607,What to expect if I have Nosebleed  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The doctor will perform a physical examination. In some cases, you may be watched for signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock. The doctor will ask you questions about your nosebleeds, including:
Is there a lot of bleeding? Do the nosebleeds stop quickly when you press on the nostrils? Did they begin recently? Do they occur frequently or repeatedly? Does the bleeding always occur on one or both sides? What other symptoms do you have? Is there blood in the stools? Are you vomiting blood ? Do you bruise or bleed easily? Are there tiny red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae)? Are you taking blood thinners (Coumadin) or aspirin ?
Diagnostic tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count Nasal endoscopy (examination of the nose using a camera) Partial thromboplastin time measurements Prothrombin (PT) CT scan of the nose and sinuses
Treatment is usually focused on the cause of the nosebleeds, and may include:
Controlling blood pressure Closing the blood vessel using heat, electric current, or silver nitrate sticks Nasal packing Reducing a broken nose or removing a foreign body Reducing the amount of blood thinners or stopping aspirin
You may be referred to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to diagnose and treat the condition."
5608,What are the symptoms of Otalgia?,"The symptoms of an ear infection may include:
Ear pain Fever Fussiness Increased crying Irritability
Many children will have temporary and minor hearing loss during, and right after, an ear infection. Permanent hearing loss is rare, but the risk increases with the number of infections."
5609,What causes Otalgia?,"The eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is normally made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection.
Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. What you think is ear pain may actually be coming from another location, such as your temporomandibular joint, your teeth, throat, or other location. This is called ""referred"" pain.
Causes of ear pain may include:
Arthritis of the jaw Acute ear infection Chronic ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or severely impacted ear wax Ruptured or perforated eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat with referred pain to the ears Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection
Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection, or the following causes:
Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in the ear"
5610,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Otalgia ?,"Call your doctor if:
Your child has a high fever or severe pain or seems sicker than is usual for an ear infection. New symptoms appear, especially: Dizziness Severe headache Swelling around the ear Weakness of the face muscles
Severe pain suddenly stops; this may be a sign of a ruptured eardrum.
Symptoms (pain, fever, or irritability) get worse or do not improve within 24 - 48 hours."
5611,What to expect if I have Otalgia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The doctor will do a physical examination, and examine the ear, nose, and throat areas.
Pain, tenderness, or redness of the mastoid bone behind the ear on the skull is often a sign of a serious infection."
5612,What causes Otorrhea?,"Most of the time, any fluid leaking out of an ear is ear wax.
A ruptured eardrum can cause a white, slightly bloody, or yellow discharge from the ear. Dry crusted material on a child's pillow is often a sign of a ruptured eardrum. The eardrum may also bleed.
Causes of a ruptured eardrum include:
Foreign object in the ear canal Injury from a blow to the head, foreign object, very loud noises, or sudden pressure changes (such as in airplanes) Inserting cotton-tipped swabs or other small objects into the ear Middle ear infection
Other causes of ear discharge include:
Eczema and other skin irritations in the ear canal Swimmer's ear - with symptoms such as itching, scaling, a red or moist ear canal, and pain that increases when you move the earlobe"
5613,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Otorrhea ?,"The discharge is white, yellow, clear, or bloody. The discharge is the result of an injury. The discharge has lasted more than 5 days. There is severe pain. The discharge is associated with other symptoms, such as fever or headache. There is loss of hearing. There is redness or swelling coming out of the ear canal."
5614,What are the symptoms of Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid?,"Thyroid cancer usually begins as a small lump (nodule) in the thyroid gland, which is located at the center part of the front of the neck.
While some small lumps may be cancer, most thyroid nodules are harmless and are not cancerous.
Most of the time, there are no other symptoms."
5615,What causes Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid?,"The cause of this cancer is unknown. A genetic defect may be involved.
Radiation increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Exposure may occur from:
High-dose external radiation treatments to the neck, especially during childhood, used to treat childhood cancer or some benign childhood conditions. Radiation due to atomic bomb testing in the Marshall Islands and the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine, mostly in children.
Radiation given through a vein (through an IV) during medical tests and treatments does not increase the risk of developing thyroid cancer."
5616,Who is at highest risk for Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid ?,"About 80% of all thyroid cancers diagnosed in the United States are papillary carcinoma type. It is more common in women than in men. It may occur in childhood, but is most often seen in adults around the age of 45."
5617,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid ?,Call your health care provider if you have a lump in your neck.
5618,What to expect if I have Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The survival rate for papillary thyroid cancer is excellent. More than 95% of adults with such cancer survive at least 10 years. The prognosis is better for patients younger than 40 and for those with smaller tumors.
The following factors may decrease the survival rate:
Age over 45 Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body Cancer has spread to soft tissue Large tumor"
5619,What are the symptoms of Salivary gland tumors?,"A firm, usually painless swelling in one of the salivary glands (in front of the ears, under the chin, or on the floor of the mouth); the size of the swelling gradually increases. Difficulty moving one side of the face, known as facial nerve palsy"
5620,What causes Salivary gland tumors?,"The salivary glands are located around the mouth. They produce saliva, which moistens food to help with chewing and swallowing.
Saliva contains enzymes that begin the digestion process, and help cleanse the mouth by washing away bacteria and food particles. By keeping the mouth moist, saliva helps to keep dentures, retainers, or other orthodontic appliances in place.
There are three pairs of major salivary glands. The largest are the parotid glands, located in each cheek over the jaw in front of the ears. Two submandibular glands are at the back of the mouth on both sides of the jaw. Two sublingual glands are under the floor of the mouth. There are also thousands of minor salivary glands around the rest of the mouth.
All of the salivary glands empty saliva into the mouth through ducts that open at various locations in the mouth.
Swelling of the salivary glands is most commonly due to:
Abdominal surgery Cirrhosis of the liver Infections Other cancers Salivary duct stones Salivary gland infections Sarcoidosis Sjogren syndrome
The most common type of salivary gland tumor is a slow-growing noncancerous (benign) tumor of the parotid gland that gradually increases the size of the gland. However, some of these tumors can be cancerous (malignant).
Malignant salivary gland tumors are usually carcinomas."
5621,Who is at highest risk for Salivary gland tumors ?,"Salivary gland tumors are rare, especially in children."
5622,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Salivary gland tumors ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You have pain when eating or chewing You notice a lump in the mouth, under the jaw, or in the neck that does not go away in 2 - 3 weeks or is getting larger"
5623,What to expect if I have Salivary gland tumors  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most salivary gland tumors are noncancerous and slow growing. Removing the tumor with surgery usually cures the condition. In rare cases, the tumor is cancerous and further treatment is needed."
5624,What are the symptoms of Swimmer's ear?,"Drainage from the ear -- yellow, yellow-green, pus-like, or foul smelling Ear pain, which may get worse when you pull on the outer ear Hearing loss Itching of the ear or ear canal"
5625,What causes Swimmer's ear?,"Swimming in polluted water can lead to swimmer's ear. Water-loving bacteria such as Pseudomonas, as well as other bacteria or fungi (in rare cases), can cause ear infections.
Other causes of swimmer's ear include:
Inflammation and irritation of the bone and tissues at the bottom of the skull (malignant otitis externa) Scratching the ear or inside the ear Getting something stuck in the ear
Trying to clean wax from the ear canal, especially with cotton swabs or small objects, can irritate or damage the skin.
Long-term (chronic) swimmer's ear may be due to:
Allergic reaction to something placed in the ear Chronic skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis"
5626,Who is at highest risk for Swimmer%27s ear ?,"Swimmer's ear is fairly common, especially among teenagers and young adults. It is occasionally associated with middle ear infection (otitis media) or upper respiratory infections such as colds."
5627,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Swimmer%27s ear ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You develop any symptoms of swimmer's ear You notice any drainage coming from your ears Your symptoms get worse or continue despite treatment You have new symptoms, such as fever or pain and redness of the skull behind the ear"
5628,What to expect if I have Swimmer%27s ear  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When treated properly, swimmer's ear usually gets better."
5629,What are the symptoms of Tooth abscess?,"The main symptom is a severe toothache. The pain is continuous and may be described as gnawing, sharp, shooting, or throbbing.
Other symptoms may include:
Bitter taste in the mouth Breath odor General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling Fever Pain when chewing Sensitivity of the teeth to hot or cold Swollen glands of the neck Swollen area of the upper or lower jaw -- a very serious symptom"
5630,What causes Tooth abscess?,"A tooth abscess is a complication of tooth decay. It may also result from trauma to the tooth, such as when a tooth is broken or chipped. Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread out from the root of the tooth and to the bones supporting the tooth.
Infection results in a collection of pus (dead tissue, live and dead bacteria, white blood cells) and swelling of the tissues within the tooth. This causes a painful toothache. If the pulp of the tooth dies, the toothache may stop, unless an abscess develops. This is especially true if the infection remains active and continues to spread and destroy tissue."
5631,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tooth abscess ?,"Call your dentist if you have a persistent, throbbing toothache."
5632,What to expect if I have Tooth abscess  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Untreated abscesses may get worse and can lead to life-threatening complications.
Prompt treatment usually cures the infection. The tooth can usually be saved in many cases."
5633,What are the symptoms of Trench mouth ?,"Trench mouth is a painful bacterial infection that involves swelling (inflammation) and ulcers in the gums (gingiva).
Bad breath Crater-like ulcers between the teeth Fever Foul taste in the mouth Gums appear reddened and swollen Grayish film on the gums Painful gums Profuse gum bleeding in response to any pressure or irritation
Note: Symptoms often begin suddenly."
5634,What are the causes of Van der Woude syndrome?,"Mutations in the IRF6 gene cause van der Woude syndrome. The IRF6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in early development. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes.
The IRF6 protein is active in cells that give rise to tissues in the head and face. It is also involved in the development of other parts of the body, including the skin and genitals.
Mutations in the IRF6 gene that cause van der Woude syndrome prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from making any functional protein. A shortage of the IRF6 protein affects the development and maturation of tissues in the face, resulting in the signs and symptoms of van der Woude syndrome."
5635,Who is at risk for Van der Woude syndrome?,"Individuals with parents that carry a mutation in IRF6 gene are at risk. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. Occasionally, an individual who has a copy of the altered gene does not show any signs or symptoms of the disorder."
5636,What are the symptoms of Nocturnal enuresis?,"The main symptom is involuntary urination, usually at night, that occurs at least twice per month."
5637,What causes Nocturnal enuresis?,"Children develop complete control over their bladders at different ages. Nighttime dryness is usually the last stage of toilet learning. When children wet the bed more than twice per month after age 5 or 6, it is called bedwetting or nocturnal enuresis.
Bedwetting is common. More than 5 million children in the U.S. wet the bed at night.
Children who were dry for at least 6 months and then started wetting again have secondary enuresis. There are many reasons that children wet the bed after being fully toilet trained. It might be physical, emotional, or just a change in sleep.
Children who have never been consistently dry at night have primary enuresis. This usually occurs when the body makes more urine overnight than the bladder can hold and the child does not wake up when the bladder is full. The child's brain has not learned to respond to the signal that the bladder is full. It is not the child's or the parent's fault.
Physical causes are rare, but may include lower spinal cord lesions, congenital malformations of the genitourinary tract, infections of the urinary tract, or diabetes.
Bedwetting runs strongly in families.
About 9% of boys and 6% of girls still wet the bed at age 7. The numbers drop slightly by age 10. Although the problem goes away over time, many children and even a small number of adults continue to have bedwetting episodes."
5638,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bedwetting ?,"Be sure to mention bedwetting to your child's health care provider.
Children should have a physical exam and a urine test to rule out urinary tract infection or other causes.
If your child is having pain with urination, fever, or blood in the urine, contact your child's doctor right away."
5639,What to expect if I have Bedwetting  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The condition poses no threat to the health of the child if there is no physical cause of bedwetting. The child may feel embarrassment or have a loss of self-esteem because of the problem. It is important to reassure the child. Most children respond to some type of treatment.
5640,What are the symptoms of Bowlegs?,Knees do not touch when standing with feet together (ankles touching) Bowing of legs is same on both side of the body (symmetrical) Bowed legs continue beyond age 3
5641,What causes Bowlegs?,"Infants are born bowlegged because of their folded position in the uterus. The infant's bowed legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk and the legs begin to bear weight (about 12 to 18 months old).
By around age 3, the child can usually stand with the ankles apart and the knees just touching. If the bowed legs are still present, the child is called bowlegged.
Bowlegs may be caused by illnesses such as:
Blount's disease Bone dysplasias (abnormal development) Fractures that do not heal correctly Lead or fluoride poisoning Rickets, which is caused by a vitamin D deficiency"
5642,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bowlegs ?,Call your health care provider if your child shows persistent or worsening bowed legs after age 3.

5644,What are the symptoms of Child physical abuse?,"An adult may bring an injured child to an emergency room with a strange explanation of the cause of the injury. The child's injury may not be recent.
Symptoms include:
Black eyes Broken bones that are unusual and unexplained Bruise marks shaped like hands, fingers, or objects (such as a belt) Bruises in areas where normal childhood activities would not usually result in bruising Bulging fontanelle (soft spot) or separated sutures in an infant's skull Burn (scalding) marks, usually seen on the child's hands, arms, or buttocks Choke marks around the neck Cigarette burns on exposed areas or on the genitals Circular marks around the wrists or ankles (signs of twisting or tying up)' Human bite marks Lash marks Unexplained unconsciousness in an infant"
5645,What causes Child physical abuse?,"Physical abuse tends to occur at moments of great stress. Many people who commit physical abuse were abused themselves as children. As a result, they often do not realize that abuse is not appropriate discipline.
Often people who commit physical abuse also have poor impulse control. This prevents them from thinking about what happens as a result of their actions.
The rate of child abuse is fairly high. The most common form is neglect."
5646,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Child physical abuse ?,"All states require that you report any known or suspected child abuse.
Call your health care provider, Child Protective Services, or local police if you suspect or know that someone is being abused."
5647,What to expect if I have Child physical abuse  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The child's physical recovery depends on the severity of the injuries. Psychological recovery depends on the results of therapy, and whether the child can develop trusting relationships with adult caregivers.
The authorities will determine whether the abuser gets psychiatric help, such as parenting training and impulse/anger management training.
Child protection agencies generally make every effort to reunite families when possible."
5648,What are the symptoms of Child neglect and psychological abuse?,"Symptoms of psychological abuse may include:
Difficulties in school Eating disorders, leading to weight loss or poor weight gain Emotional issues such as low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety Rebellious behavior
8Sleep disorders
Vague physical complaints"
5649,What causes Child neglect and psychological abuse?,"The rate at which children are physically and emotionally neglected is difficult to define.
Abused children are at risk of becoming abusers themselves as adults."
5650,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Child psychological abuse and neglect ?,"Call your health care provider if a child has:
Physical changes, such as unexplained injuries, weight loss, or severe tiredness Unexplained behavior changes
Suspected child abuse of any form must be reported to the authorities."
5651,What to expect if I have Child psychological abuse and neglect  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, many children and parents can be reunited as a family.
The long-term outcome depends on:
How severe the abuse was For how long the child was abused The success of therapy and parenting classes"
5652,What are the symptoms of Child sexual abuse?,"Symptoms of sexual abuse in chlildren are similar to those of depression or severe anxiety and nervousness.
They can include:
Bowel disorders, such as soiling oneself (encopresis) Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa Genital or rectal symptoms, such as pain during a bowel movement or urination, or vaginal itch or discharge Repeated headaches Sleep problems Stomach aches (vague complaints)
Children who are abused may:
Display disruptive behaviors such as using alcohol and street drugs or engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors Do poorly in school Have excessive fears Withdraw from normal activities"
5653,What causes Child sexual abuse?,"Society was reluctant to deal with child sexual abuse a few decades ago. Today, it is considered a serious issue.
It is difficult to determine how often child sexual abuse occurs, because it is more secret than physical abuse. Children are often scared to tell anyone about the abuse. Many cases of abuse are not reported.
Abusers are usually men. They tend to know the person they are abusing. The abuser violates the trust of the younger person, which makes the sexual abuse even more devastating.
Child sexual abuse occurs in all social and economic classes of people. It has the same type of risk factors as physical child abuse, including:
Alcohol and drug abuse Family troubles Poverty
Abusers often have a history of physical or sexual abuse themselves.
A small group of repeated abusers have the psychiatric disorder, pedophilia. Their preferred sexual contact is with children."
5654,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Child sexual abuse ?,"If you suspect child abuse in any form, immediately call your health care provider, Child Protective Services, or police."
5655,What to expect if I have Child sexual abuse  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The biggest issue is the child's mental health.
The outcome depends on:
Family and social support The child's personality The length of time the child was abused and the type of abuse Therapy"
5656,What are the symptoms of Cryptorchidism?,"There are usually no symptoms, except that the testicle cannot be found in the scrotum (this may be described as an empty scrotum)."
5657,What causes Cryptorchidism?,"Most of the time, children's testicles descend by the time they are 9 months old. Undescended testicles are fairly common in infants who are born early (premature infants). It occurs in about 3 - 4% of full-term infants.
Once a testicle has been found in the scrotum, it is considered descended, even if it is temporarily pulled back (retracted) during a later examination.
Some babies have a condition called retractile testes, in which the health care provider sometimes cannot find the testicles. This is due to the muscle reflex that retracts the testicles and the small testicle size before puberty. The testicles will descend at puberty. Surgery is not needed.
Testicles that do not descend by the time the child is 1 year old should be evaluated. Studies suggest that surgery should be done by this age. Surgery can reduce the chances of permanent damage to the testicles, which can lead to fertility problems later in life.
Testicles that do not naturally descend into the scrotum are considered abnormal. An undescended testicle is more likely to develop cancer, even if it is brought down into the scrotum. The other testicle is also more likely to develop cancer, even if it descended properly.
Bringing the testicle into the scrotum can improve sperm production and increases the odds of good fertility. It also allows the health care provider to examine the testicle to detect cancer early.
In other cases, no testicle may be found, even during surgery. This may be due to a problem that occurred while the baby was still developing in the mother (congenital)."
5658,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cryptorchidism ?,Call your child's health care provider if he appears to have an undescended testicle.
5659,What to expect if I have Cryptorchidism  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases get better on their own, without any treatment. Medicine or surgery to correct the condition is usually successful. In about 5% of patients with undescended testicles, the testicles cannot be found at the time of surgery. This is called a vanished or absent testis."
5660,What are the symptoms of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome?,"Cleft lip or palate Epispadias or undescended testicle (cryptorchidism) Extra fingers (polydactyly) Limited range of motion Nail problems, including missing or deformed nails Short arms and legs, especially forearm and lower leg Short height (between 3 1/2 and 5 feet tall) Sparse, absent, or fine textured hair Tooth abnormalities: Peg teeth Widely spaced teeth Teeth present at birth (natal teeth) Delayed or missing teeth"
5661,What causes Ellis-van Creveld syndrome?,"Ellis-van Creveld is passed down through families (inherited). It is caused by defects in one of two Ellis van Creveld syndrome genes (EVC and EVC2) that are next to each other.
The severity of the disease varies from person to person. The highest rate of the condition is seen among the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It is fairly rare in the general population."
5662,Who is at highest risk for Ellis-van Creveld syndrome ?,Ellis-van Creveld is passed down through families (inherited).
5663,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Ellis-van Creveld syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if your child has symptoms of this syndrome. If you have a family history of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and your child has any symptoms, visit your health care provider.
Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and how to care for the patient."
5664,What to expect if I have Ellis-van Creveld syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many babies with this condition die in early infancy, usually due to a small chest or heart defect. Stillbirth is common.
The outcome depends on which body system is involved and to what extent that body system is involved. Like most genetic conditions involving bones or the physical structure, intelligence is normal."
5665,What are the symptoms of Juvenile idiopathic arthritis?,"Arthritis symptoms:
Joint stiffness when you wake up in the morning Joint pain Limited range of motion Joints may be warm or swollen and sometimes red A child may stop using an affected limb or may limp Back pain
Body-wide JRA symptoms:
Fever, usually high fevers every day Rash (trunk and extremities) that comes and goes with the fever Swollen lymph nodes (glands) JRA can also cause eye inflammation called uveitis. This problem can occur without any eye symptoms, or someone may have: Red eyes Eye pain Increased pain when looking at light (photophobia) Vision changes
Many other medical problems can cause symptoms similar to those of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, including:
Lyme disease rheumatic fever bone infections (osteomyelitis) Sarcoidosis psoriatic arthritis vasculitis Inflammatory bowel disease"
5666,What causes Juvenile idiopathic arthritis?,"The cause of JRA is not known. It is thought to be an autoimmune illness. In this type of condition, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue.
It is divided into several categories:
Systemic JRA involves joint swelling or pain, fevers, and rash. It is the least common category. Polyarticular JRA involves many joints. This form of JRA may turn into rheumatoid arthritis. It may involve large and small joints of the legs and arms, as well as the TMJ and cervical spine. Pauciarticular JRA involves only a few joints, usually the hips, knees, or ankles."
5667,Who is at highest risk for Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ?,JRA usually occurs before age 16.
5668,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
You notice symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment New symptoms develop"
5669,What to expect if I have Juvenile idiopathic arthritis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"JRA is seldom life threatening.
Children who have many joints involved, or who have a positive rheumatoid factor are more likely to have chronic pain and poor school attendance, and to be disabled.
Long periods with no symptoms are more common in those who have only a small number of joints involved. Many patients with JRA eventually go into remission with very little loss of function and deformity."
5670,What are the symptoms of Stress in childhood?,"Children may not recognize that they are stressed. Parents may suspect that the child is excessively stressed if the child has experienced a potentially stressful situation and begins to have symptoms such as:
Physical symptoms:
Decreased appetite, other changes in eating habits Headache New or recurrent bedwetting Nightmares Sleep disturbances Stuttering Upset stomach or vague stomach pain Other physical symptoms with no physical illness
Emotional or behavioral symptoms:
Anxiety Worries Inability to relax New or recurring fears (fear of the dark, fear of being alone, fear of strangers) Clinging, unwilling to let you out of sight Questioning (may or may not ask questions) Anger Crying Whining Inability to control emotions Aggressive behavior Stubborn behavior Regression to behaviors that are typical of an earlier developmental stage Unwillingness to participate in family or school activities"
5671,What causes Stress in childhood?,"Stress is a response to any situation or factor that creates a negative emotional or physical change or both. People of all ages can experience stress. In small quantities, stress is good, it can motivate you and help you be more productive. However, excessive stress can interfere with life, activities, and health. Stress can affect the way people think, act, and feel.
Children learn how to respond to stress by what they have seen and experienced in the past. Most stresses experienced by children may seem insignificant to adults, but because children have few previous experiences from which to learn, even situations that require small changes can have enormous impacts on a child's feelings of safety and security.
Pain, injury, and illness are major stressors for children. Medical treatments produce even greater stress. Recognition of parental stress (such as that seen in divorce or financial crisis) is a severe stressor for children, as is death or loss of a loved one."
5672,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stress in childhood ?,Seek professional help or advice when signs of stress do not decrease or disappear.
5673,How can parents help?,"Parents can help children respond to stress in healthy ways. Following are some tips:
Provide a safe, secure, familiar, consistent, and dependable home. Be selective in the television programs that young children watch (including news broadcasts), which can produce fears and anxiety. Spend calm, relaxed time with your children. Encourage your child to ask questions. Encourage expression of concerns, worries, or fears. Listen to your child without being critical. Build your child's feelings of self-worth. Use encouragement and affection. Try to involve your child in situations where he or she can succeed. Try to use positive encouragement and reward instead of punishment. Allow the child opportunities to make choices and have some control in his or her life. This is particularly important, because research shows that the more people feel they have control over a situation, the better their response to stress will be. Encourage physical activity. Develop awareness of situations and events that are stressful for children. These include new experiences, fear of unpredictable outcomes, unpleasant sensations, unmet needs or desires, and loss. Recognize signs of unresolved stress in your child. Keep your child informed of necessary and anticipated changes such as changes in jobs or moving"
5674,What are the symptoms of Alcohol withdrawal?,"Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually occur within 5 - 10 hours after the last drink, but can occur days later. Symptoms get worse in 48 - 72 hours, and may persist for weeks.

Other symptoms may include:
Clammy skin Enlarged (dilated) pupils Headache Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Pallor Rapid heart rate Sweating Tremor of the hands or other body parts
A severe form of alcohol withdrawal called delirium tremens can cause:
Agitation Severe confusion Seeing or feeling things that aren't there (hallucinations) Fever Seizures"
5675,What causes Alcohol withdrawal?,"Alcohol withdrawal occurs most often in adults, but it may occur in teenagers or children.
The more you drink every day, the more likely you are to develop alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking.
You may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if you have certain other medical problems."
5676,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alcohol withdrawal ?,"Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that may rapidly become life threatening.
Call your health care provider or go the emergency room if you think you might be in alcohol withdrawal, especially if you were using alcohol often and recently stopped.
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms persist after treatment.
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if seizures, fever, severe confusion, hallucinations, or irregular heartbeats occur."
5677,What to expect if I have Alcohol withdrawal  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"How well a person does depends on the amount of organ damage and whether the person can stop drinking completely.
Alcohol withdrawal may range from a mild and uncomfortable disorder to a serious, life-threatening condition.
Symptoms such as sleep changes, rapid changes in mood, and fatigue may last for months. People who continue to drink a lot may develop health problems such as liver and heart disease.
Most people who go through alcohol withdrawal make a full recovery. However, death is possible, especially if delirium tremens occurs."
5678,What are the symptoms of Anxiety and Stress?,"Stress is a normal feeling. In small doses, stress can help you get things done. Stress does not affect everyone the same way.
Many people feel stress symptoms in their body. You may be having pain i n your abdomen, headaches, and muscle tightness or pain.
When you are very stressed, you may notice:
A faster heart rate Skipped heartbeats Rapid breathing Sweating Trembling Dizziness Other symptoms include: Loose stools Frequent need to pee Dry mouth Problems swallowing You may have a harder time focusing, feel tired most of the time, or lose your temper more often. Stress may also cause sexual problems. It can also cause problems with falling or staying asleep and nightmares"

Examples are:
Starting a new job or school Moving to a new home Getting married Having a child Breaking up with someone An injury or illness to you, a friend, or a loved one is a common cause of stress. Feelings of stress and anxiety are common in people who feel depressed and sad.
Some drugs may cause or worsen symptoms of stress.
These can include:
Some inhaler medicines used to treat asthma Thyroid drugs Some diet pills Some cold remedies Caffeine, cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco products may also cause or make symptoms of stress or anxiety worse."
5680,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Anxiety and Stress?,"Call a suicide hotline if you have thoughts of suicide.
Reasons you may want to seek more help are:
You have feelings of panic, such as dizziness, rapid breathing, or a racing heartbeat. You are unable to work or function at home or at your job. You have fears that you cannot control.

5681,What are the symptoms of Cocaine withdrawal?,"Primary symptoms may include:
Agitation and restless behavior Depressed mood Fatigue Generalized malaise 8Increased appetite Vivid and unpleasant dreams Slowing of activity
The craving and depression can last for months following cessation of long-term heavy use (particularly daily).
Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with suicidal thoughts in some people.
During withdrawal, there can be powerful, intense cravings for cocaine. However, the ""high"" associated with ongoing use becomes less and less pleasant, and can produce fear and extreme suspicion rather than joy (euphoria). Just the same, the cravings may remain powerful."
5682,What causes Cocaine withdrawal?,"Cocaine produces a sense of extreme joy by causing the brain to release higher than normal amounts of some biochemicals. However, cocaine's effects on other parts of the body can be very serious or even deadly.
When cocaine use is stopped or when a binge ends, a crash follows almost immediately. This crash is accompanied by a strong craving for more cocaine. Additional symptoms include:
fatigue, lack of pleasure, anxiety, irritability, sleepiness, sometimes agitation or extreme suspicion.
Cocaine withdrawal often has no visible physical symptoms like the vomiting and shaking that accompanies the withdrawal from heroin or alcohol.
In the past, people underestimated the how addictive cocaine can be. However, cocaine is addictive when addiction is defined as a desire for more of the drug, despite negative consequences.
The level of craving, irritability, delayed depression, and other symptoms produced by cocaine withdrawal rivals or exceeds that felt with other withdrawal syndromes."
5683,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cocaine withdrawal ?,Call your health care provider if you use cocaine and need help to stop using it.
5684,What to expect if I have Cocaine withdrawal  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Cocaine addiction is difficult to treat, and relapse can occur. However, the rates of achieving stabilization are as good as those for other chronic illnesses like diabetes and asthma.
Treatment should start with the least restrictive option and move up if necessary. Outpatient care is as effective as inpatient care for most people addicted to cocaine, according to the research.
Presently there are no effective medications for reducing craving, although some are being tested. Some studies have reported that medications such as amantadine and bromocriptine may help to reduce patient's craving, increase energy, and normalize sleep, particularly among those with the most seriously addicted."
5685,Culture-bound Syndrome?,"Some doctors believe dhat syndrome to be either a culture-bound presentation of clinical depression as a somatized set of symptoms or a result of Western doctors' misinterpretation of patients' descriptions of their condition. It is very common in Pakistani culture as well. Most of them come with the complaints of ""drops"".. and become extremely anxious about it and see it as loss of ""male power"". it is often related with obsessive ruminations and somatoform symptoms. Others see it as a distinct clinical entity which is less culture-bound than these critics assert, and describe it as one form of a syndrome of ""semen-loss anxiety"" which also occurs in other Eastern cultures as jiryan and shen-k'uei, as well as in Western cultures."
5686,What are the symptoms of Drug dependence?,"Some of the symptoms and behaviors of drug dependence include:
Confusion Continuing to use drugs even when health, work, or family are being harmed Episodes of violence Hostility when confronted about drug dependence Lack of control over drug abuse - being unable to stop or reduce alcohol intake Making excuses to use drugs Missing work or school, or a decrease in performance Need for daily or regular drug use to function Neglecting to eat Not caring for physical appearance No longer taking part in activities because of drug abuse Secretive behavior to hide drug use Using drugs even when alone"
5687,What causes Drug dependence?,"Drug abuse can lead to drug dependence or addiction. People who use drugs for pain relief may become dependent, although this is rare in those who don't have a history of addiction.
The exact cause of drug abuse and dependence is not known. However, a person's genes, the action of the drug, peer pressure, emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and environmental stress all can be factors.
Peer pressure can lead to drug use or abuse, but at least half of those who become addicted have depression, attention deficit disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or another mental health problem.
Children who grow up in an environment of illicit drug use may first see their parents using drugs. This may put them at a higher risk for developing an addiction later in life for both environmental and genetic reasons.
People who are more likely to abuse or become dependent on drugs include those who:
Have depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia Have easy access to drugs Have low self-esteem, or problems with relationships Live a stressful lifestyle, economic or emotional Live in a culture where there is a high social acceptance of drug use
Commonly abused substances include:
Opiates and narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness (sedation) and sometimes feelings of euphoria. These include heroin, opium, codeine, meperidine (Demerol), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and oxycodone (Oxycontin).
Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants include amphetamines, cocaine, dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate (Ritalin). These drugs have a stimulating effect, and people can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect (tolerance).
Central nervous system depressants include alcohol, barbiturates (amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital), benzodiazepines (Valium, Ativan, Xanax), chloral hydrate, and paraldehyde. These substances produce a sedative and anxiety -reducing effect, which can lead to dependence.
Hallucinogens include LSD, mescaline, psilocybin (""mushrooms""), and phencyclidine (PCP or ""angel dust""). They can cause people to see things that aren't there (hallucinations) and can lead to psychological dependence. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the active ingredient found in marijuana (cannabis) and hashish.
There are several stages of drug use that may lead to dependence. Young people seem to move more quickly through the stages than do adults.
Experimental use: typically involves peers, done for recreational use; the user may enjoy defying parents or other authority figures.
Regular use: the user misses more and more school or work; worries about losing drug source; uses drugs to ""fix"" negative feelings; begins to stay away from friends and family; may change friends to those who are regular users; shows increased tolerance and ability to ""handle"" the drug.
Daily preoccupation: the user loses any motivation; does not care about school and work; has obvious behavior changes; thinking about drug use is more important than all other interests, including relationships; the user becomes secretive; may begin dealing drugs to help support habit; use of other, harder drugs may increase; legal problems may increase.
Dependence: cannot face daily life without drugs; denies problem; physical condition gets worse; loss of ""control"" over use; may become suicidal; financial and legal problems get worse; may have broken ties with family members or friends."
5688,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Drug dependence ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are addicted to drugs and would like to get off of them, or if you have been cut off from your drug supply and are at risk of withdrawal.
Most employers also offer referral services for their employees with substance abuse problems."
5689,What to expect if I have Drug dependence  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Drug abuse and dependence may lead to a fatal drug overdose. Some people start taking the drugs again after they have stopped. Relapses can lead to continued dependence.
5690,How to do Exposure Therapy?,"Some of the rules for constructing a good program of Exposure Therapy are:
The subject should have a final goal which should represent non-phobic behavior. This might be (for example) to hold a large snake and rub it against their cheek for several minutes. They should also have in mind a series of intermediate steps such that once they have partially habituated to one step the next is close enough to it that they can readily move on. Such a sequence is called a hierarchy. It may be explicit, in the form of a list of increasingly challenging tasks, or implicit, in the form of a set of principles for escalating the exposure. The therapist will decide which of these will be more useful for the subject. (A useful way of constructing such a hierarchy is the Method of Factors. At every stage the subjects self-exposure should be completely voluntary - a criterion that may be derived from the theory of cognitive dissonance. One important corollary of this principle is that, at every moment, the subject must have an easy way of terminating the exposure. By choosing not to escape - and therefore practising a competing response - the subject thereby weakens the arousal-escape connection. The arousal experienced at any point should be the maximum that the subject is prepared to accept (this is the main difference between Exposure Therapy and Systematic desensitization). It's useful if at each stage the subject asks themselves ""is there anything more I could do?"" By considering which factors they can manipulate they should be able to keep moving smoothly up their hierarchy. Research by Marks and Rachmann citation needed demonstrated that optimum results are obtained with daily practice lasting at least an hour; and that the daily session should be ended by allowing the level of arousal to fall off to around half its peak value. For this reason it's useful for the subject to keep a note of their arousal level on a 0-8 scale (where 0=no arousal and 8=intolerable arousal). Before this fall-off phase the level of arousal should be maintained at an uncomfortable but tolerable level."
5691,What are the symptoms of Fibromyalgia?,"Pain in the main symptom of fibromyalgia. It may be mild to severe.
Painful areas are called tender points. Tender points are found in the soft tissue on the back of the neck, shoulders, chest, lower back, hips, shins, elbows, and knees. The pain then spreads out from these areas. The pain may feel like a deep ache, or a shooting, burning pain. The joints are not affected, although the pain may feel like it is coming from the joints.
People with fibromyalgia tend to wake up with body aches and stiffness. For some patients, pain improves during the day and gets worse at night. Some patients have pain all day long.
Pain may get worse with activity, cold or damp weather, anxiety, and stress.
Fatigue, depressed mood, and sleep problems are seen in almost all patients with fibromyalgia. Many say that they can't get to sleep or stay asleep, and they feel tired when they wake up.
Other symptoms of fibromyalgia may include:
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Memory and concentration problems Numbness and tingling in hands and feet Palpitations Reduced ability to exercise Tension or migraine headaches"
5692,What causes Fibromyalgia?,"The cause is unknown. Possible causes or triggers of fibromyalgia include:

5696,What are the symptoms of Grief?,"There can be five stages of grief. These reactions might not occur in a specific order, and can (at times) occur together. Not everyone experiences all of these emotions:
Denial, disbelief, numbness Anger, blaming others Bargaining (for instance ""If I am cured of this cancer, I will never smoke again."") Depressed mood, sadness, and crying Acceptance, coming to terms
People who are grieving may have crying spells, some trouble sleeping, and lack of productivity at work."
5697,What causes Grief?,"Grief may be triggered by the death of a loved one. People also can experience grief if they have an illness for which there is no cure, or a chronic condition that affects their quality of life. The end of a significant relationship may also cause a grieving process.
Everyone feels grief in their own way. However, there are common stages to the process of mourning. It starts with recognizing a loss and continues until a person eventually accepts that loss. People's responses to grief will be different, depending on the circumstances of the death.
For example, if the person who died had a chronic illness, the death may have been expected. The end of the person's suffering might even have come as a relief. If the death was accidental or violent, coming to a stage of acceptance might take longer."
5698,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Grief ?,"Call your health care provider if:
You can't deal with grief You are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol You become very depressed You have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life"

5702,Who is at highest risk for Hyperventilation syndrome ?,"Hyperventilation syndrome can be triggered by emotions of stress, anxiety, depression, or anger. Occasional hyperventilation from panic is generally related to a specific fear or phobia, such as a fear of heights, dying, or closed-in spaces (claustrophobia)."
5703,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Hyperventilation syndrome ?,"Rapid breathing for the first time. (This is a medical emergency and you should be taken to the emergency room right away.) Severe pain, having a fever, or noticed any bleeding. Worsening of symptoms."
5704,What are the symptoms of Marijuana intoxication?,"The intoxicating effects of marijuana include relaxation, sleepiness, and mild euphoria (getting high).
Smoking marijuana leads to fast and predictable signs and symptoms. Eating marijuana can cause slower, and sometimes less predictable effects.
Marijuana can cause undesirable side effects, which increase with higher doses. These side effects include:
Decreased short-term memory Dry mouth Impaired perception and motor skills Red eyes
More serious side effects include panic, paranoia, or acute psychosis, which may be more common with new users or in those who already have a psychiatric disease.
The amount and effect of these side effects varies from person to person, as well as with the amount of marijuana used.
Marijuana is often cut with hallucinogens and other, more dangerous drugs that have more serious side effects than marijuana. These side effects may include:
Acute high blood pressure with headache Chest pain and heart rhythm disturbances Extreme hyperactivity and physical violence Heart attack Seizures Stroke Sudden collapse (cardiac arrest)"
5705,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Marijuana intoxication ?,"If someone who has been using marijuana develops any of the symptoms of intoxication, has trouble breathing, or cannot be awakened, call 911 or your local emergency number.

The child may be sweating, breathing very fast (hyperventilating), have a fast heart rate (palpitations), and widened (dilated) pupils. The spell may last 10 - 20 minutes, then the child goes back to sleep.
Most children are unable to explain what happened the next morning. They often have no memory of the event when they wake up the next day.
Children with night terrors may also sleep walk.
In contrast, nightmares are more common in the early morning. They may occur after someone watches frightening movies or TV shows, or has an emotional experience. A person may remember the details of a dream when he or she wakes up, and will not be disoriented after the episode."
5708,What causes Night terror?,"The cause is unknown, but night terrors may be triggered by:
Fever Lack of sleep Periods of emotional tension, stress, or conflict
Night terrors are most common in boys ages 5 - 7, although they also can occur in girls. They are fairly common in children ages 3 - 7, and much less common after that.
Night terrors may run in families. They can occur in adults, especially when there is emotional tension or the use of alcohol."
5709,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Night terror ?,"Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
The night terrors occur often They disrupt sleep on a regular basis Other symptoms occur with the night terror The night terror causes, or almost causes, injuries"
5710,What to expect if I have Night terror  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most children outgrow night terrors in a short period of time. The number of episodes usually decreases after age 10. Rarely, children will have problems falling asleep or staying asleep."
5711,What causes Nightmare?,"Anxiety and stress are the most common causes of nightmares.
A major life event occurs before the nightmare in some cases.
Other causes of nightmares include:
Abrupt alcohol withdrawal Breathing disorder in sleep (sleep apnea) Death of a loved one (bereavement) Excessive alcohol consumption Illness with a fever Recent withdrawal from a drug, such as sleeping pills Side effect of a drug Sleep disorder (for example, narcolepsy or sleep terror disorder) Eating just before going to bed, which raises the body's metabolism and brain activity"
5712,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Nightmare ?,"Contact your health care provider if:
You have nightmares more than once a week Nightmares stop you from getting a good night's rest, or from keeping up with your daily activities for a long period of time"
5713,What are the symptoms of Opiate withdrawal?,"Early symptoms of withdrawal include:
Agitation Anxiety Muscle aches Increased tearing Insomnia Runny nose Sweating Yawning
Late symptoms of withdrawal include:
Abdominal cramping Diarrhea Dilated pupils Goose bumps Nausea Vomiting
Opioid withdrawal reactions are very uncomfortable but are not life threatening.
Symptoms usually start within 12 hours of last heroin usage and within 30 hours of last methadone exposure."
5714,What causes Opiate withdrawal?,"About 9% of the population is believed to misuse opiates over the course of their lifetime, including illegal drugs like heroin and prescribed pain medications such as Oxycontin.
These drugs can cause physical dependence. This means that a person relies on the drug to prevent symptoms of withdrawal. Over time, greater amounts of the drug become necessary to produce the same effect.
The time it takes to become physically dependent varies with each individual.
When the drugs are stopped, the body needs time to recover, and withdrawal symptoms result. Withdrawal from opiates can occur whenever any chronic use is discontinued or reduced.
Some people even withdraw from opiates after being given such drugs for pain while in the hospital without realizing what is happening to them. They think they have the flu, and because they don't know that opiates would fix the problem, they don't crave the drugs."
5715,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Opiate withdrawal ?,Call your doctor if you are using or withdrawing from opiates.
5716,What to expect if I have Opiate withdrawal  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Withdrawal from opiates is painful, but not life threatening."
5717,What are the symptoms of Personality disorder?,"Symptoms vary widely depending on the type of personality disorder.
In general, personality disorders involve feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that do not adapt to a wide range of settings.
These patterns usually begin in adolescence and may lead to problems in social and work situations.
The severity of these conditions ranges from mild to severe."
5718,What causes Personality disorder?,"The causes of personality disorders are unknown. However, many genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role.
Mental health professionals categorize these disorders into the following types:
Antisocial personality disorder Avoidant personality disorder Borderline personality disorder Dependent personality disorder Histrionic personality disorder Narcissistic personality disorder Obsessive compulsive personality disorder Paranoid personality disorder Schizoid personality disorder Schizotypal personality disorder"
5719,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Personality disorder ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider or mental health professional if you or someone close to you has symptoms of a personality disorder.
5720,What to expect if I have Personality disorder  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook varies. Some personality disorders go away during middle age without any treatment, while others only improve slowly throughout life, even with treatment."
5721,What are the symptoms of Sleep walking?,"When people sleepwalk, they may sit up and look as though they are awake when they are actually asleep. They may get up and walk around, or do complex activities such as moving furniture, going to the bathroom, and dressing or undressing. Some people even drive a car while they are asleep.
The episode can be very brief (a few seconds or minutes) or it can last for 30 minutes or longer, but most episodes last for less than 10 minutes. If they are not disturbed, sleepwalkers will go back to sleep. However, they may fall asleep in a different or even unusual place.
Symptoms of sleepwalking include:
Acting confused or disoriented when they wake up Having blank look on face Opening eyes during sleep Not remembering the sleep walking episode when they wake up Performing detailed activity of any type during sleep Rarely, showing aggressive behavior when they are woken up by someone else Sitting up and appearing awake during sleep Taking in sleep and saying things that do not make sense Walking during sleep Taking in sleep and saying things that do not make sense"
5722,What causes Sleep walking?,"The normal sleep cycle has distinct stages, from light drowsiness to deep sleep. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is most common.
Each night people go through several cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. S leepwalking (somnambulism) most often occurs during deep, non-REM sleep (stage 3 or stage 4 sleep) early in the night. If it occurs during REM sleep, it is part of REM behavior disorder and tends to happen near morning.
The cause of sleepwalking in children is usually unknown. Fatigue, lack of sleep, and anxiety are all associated with sleepwalking.
In adults, sleepwalking may occur with:
Alcohol, sedatives, or other medication Medical conditions, such as partial complex seizures Mental disorders
In the elderly, sleepwalking may be a symptom of an organic brain syndrome or REM behavior disorders.
Sleepwalking can occur at any age, but it happens most often in children ages 5 - 12. It appears to run in families."
5723,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sleepwalking ?,"You probably won't need to visit your health care provider if you are sleepwalking. However, discuss the condition with your doctor if:
You also have other symptoms Sleepwalking is frequent or persistent You perform potentially dangerous activities (such as driving) while sleepwalking"
5724,What to expect if I have Sleepwalking  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Sleepwalking usually decreases as children get older.
It usually does not indicate a serious disorder, although it can be a symptom of other disorders.
It is unusual for sleepwalkers to perform activities that are dangerous. However, you may need to take care to prevent injuries such as falling down stairs or climbing out of a window."
5725,Could SCT be an instance of childhood-onset dysexecutive syndrome?,"The Executive system of the human brain coordinates actions and strategies for everyday tasks. Dysexecutive syndrome is defined as ""cluster of impairments generally associated with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain"" which includes ""difficulties with high-level tasks such as planning, organising, initiating, monitoring and adapting behaviour."" 
Adele Diamond has recently postulated that the core cognitive deficit of those with ADHD-PI (ADD), is working memory, or, as she coined in her recent paper on the subject, ""childhood-onset dysexecutive syndrome"". She states:
""Instructional methods that place heavy demands on working memory will disproportionately disadvantage individuals with ADD"". ""language problems often co-occur with ADD, and it is suggested that part of the reason might be that linguistic tasks, especially verbal ones, tax working memory so heavily. Spatial and artistic skills, however, are often preserved or superior in individuals with ADD."" ""The working memory deficit in many children with ADD is accompanied by markedly slowed reaction times, a characteristic that covaries with poorer working memory in general"". ""Individuals with ADD have difficulty maintaining a sufficiently high level of motivation to complete a task...They go looking for something else to do or think about because they are bored...to remedy a general lower arousal level.."""
5726,What are the symptoms of Stress?,"Stress is a normal feeling. In small doses, stress can help you get things done. Stress does not affect everyone the same way.
Many people feel stress symptoms in their body. You may be having pain in your abdomen, headaches, and muscle tightness or pain.
When you are very stressed, you may notice:
A faster heart rate (palpitations) Skipped heartbeats Rapid breathing Sweating Trembling Dizziness
Other symptoms include:
Loose stools Frequent need to pee Dry mouth Problems swallowing
You may have a harder time focusing, feel tired most of the time, or lose your temper more often. Stress may also cause sexual problems. It can also cause problems with falling or staying asleep and nightmares"
5727,What causes Stress?,"Many people have stress when they need to adapt or change. Examples are:
Starting a new job or school Moving to a new home Getting married Having a child Breaking up with someone
An injury or illness to you, a friend, or a loved one is a common cause of stress. Feelings of stress and anxiety are common in people who feel depressed and sad.
Some drugs may cause or worsen symptoms of stress. These can include:
Some inhaler medicines used to treat asthma Thyroid drugs Some diet pills Some cold remedies Caffeine, cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco products may also cause or make symptoms of stress or anxiety worse.
When these feelings happen often, a person may have an anxiety disorder. Other problems where stress may be present are:
Obsessive-compulsive disorder Panic disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)"
5728,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Stress ?,"Call a suicide hotline if you have thoughts of suicide.
Reasons you may want to seek more help are:
You have feelings of panic, such as dizziness, rapid breathing, or a racing heartbeat. You are unable to work or function at home or at your job. You have fears that you cannot control. You are having memories of a traumatic event.
Do not stop taking any prescribed medicines without talking to your doctor."
5729,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Substance abuse ?,If you are concerned about the possibility of getting addicted to any prescribed medications If you are concerned about possible drug abuse by yourself or a family member If you are interested in getting more information on drug abuse If you are seeking treatment of drug abuse for yourself or a family member
5730,What are the symptoms of Suicide?,"Often, but not always, a person may show certain symptoms or behaviors before a suicide attempt, including:
Having trouble concentrating or thinking clearly Giving away belongings Talking about going away or the need to get my affairs in order Suddenly changing behavior, especially calmness after a period of anxiety Losing interest in activities that they used to enjoy Performing self-destructive behaviors, such as heavily drinking alcohol, using illegal drugs, or cutting their body Pulling away from friends or not wanting to go out Suddenly having trouble in school or work Talking about death or suicide, or even saying that they want to hurt themselves Talking about feeling hopeless or guilty Changing sleep or eating habits"
5731,What causes Suicide?,"Suicide and suicidal behaviors usually occur in people with:
Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Depression Drug or alcohol dependence Schizophrenia
People who try to commit suicide are often trying to get away from a life situation that seems impossible to deal with. Many who make a suicide attempt are seeking relief from:
Feeling ashamed, guilty, or like a burden to others Feeling like a victim Feelings of rejection, loss, or loneliness
Suicidal behaviors may be caused by a situation or event that the person views as overwhelming, such as:
Aging (the elderly have the highest rate of suicide) Death of a loved one Dependence on drugs or alcohol Emotional trauma Serious physical illness Unemployment or money problems
Most suicide attempts do not result in death. Many of these attempts are done in a way that makes rescue possible. These attempts are often a cry for help.
Some people attempt suicide in a way that is somewhat non-violent, such as poisoning or overdose. Males, especially elderly men, are more likely to choose violent methods, such as shooting themselves. As a result, suicide attempts by males are more likely to be completed.
Relatives of people who attempt or commit suicide often blame themselves or become very angry. They may see the suicide attempt as selfish. However, people who try to commit suicide often mistakenly believe that they are doing their friends and relatives a favor by taking themselves out of the world."
5732,Who is at highest risk for Suicide ?,"Risk factors for suicide in teenagers include:
Access to guns Family member who committed suicide History of hurting themselves on purpose History of being neglected or abused Living in communities where there have been recent outbreaks of suicide in young people Romantic breakup"
5733,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Suicide ?,Call a health care provider right away if you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide.
5734,What to expect if I have Suicide  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Always take suicide attempts and threats seriously.
About one-third of people who try to commit suicide will try again within 1 year.
About 10% of people who threaten or try to commit suicide will eventually kill themselves.
The person needs mental health care right away. Do not dismiss the person as just trying to get attention."
5735,How is a toxicology screen performed?,"Toxicology screening is most often done using a blood or urine sample. However, it may be done soon after swallowing the medication, using stomach contents that are obtained through gastric lavage or after vomiting."
5736,How to prepare for a toxicology screen?,"No special preparation is needed.
If able, tell your health care provider what drugs (including over-the-counter medications) you have taken, including when and how much.
This test is sometimes part of an investigation for drug use or abuse. Special consents, handling and labeling of specimens, or other special procedures may be required."
5737,How will a toxicology screen feel?,"Blood test: When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.
Urine test: A urine test involves normal urination. There is no discomfort."
5738,Why is a toxicology screen performed?,"This test is often done in emergency medical situations.
It can be used to evaluate possible accidental or intentional overdose or poisoning.
It may help determine the cause of acute drug toxicity, to monitor drug dependency, and to determine the presence of substances in the body for medical or legal purposes.
Additional reasons the test may be performed:
Alcoholism Alcohol withdrawal state Altered mental state Analgesic nephropathy (kidney poisoning) Complicated alcohol abstinence (Delirium tremens (patient information)|delirium tremens) Delirium Dementia Drug abuse monitoring Fetal alcohol syndrome Intentional overdose Seizures Stroke secondary to cocaine Suspected sexual assault Unconsciousness
If the test is used as a drug screen, it must be done during a certain time period after the drug has been taken or while forms of the drug can still be detected in the body. Examples are below:
Alcohol: 3 to 10 hours Amphetamines: 24 to 48 hours Barbiturates: up to 6 weeks Benzodiazepines: up to 6 weeks with high level use Cocaine: 2 to 4 days; up to 10 to 22 days with heavy use Codeine: 1 to 2 days Heroin: 1 to 2 days Hydromorphone: 1 to 2 days Methadone: 2 to 3 days Morphine: 1 to 2 days Phencyclidine (PCP): 1 to 8 days Propoxyphene: 6 to 48 hours Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): 6 to 11 weeks with heavy use"
5739,What are normal results?,"Normal value ranges for over-the-counter or prescription medications may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.
A negative value usually means that alcohol, prescription medications that have not been prescribed, and illegal drugs have not been detected.
A blood toxicology screen can determine the presence and level (amount) of a drug in your body.
Urine sample results are usually reported as positive (substance is found) or negative (no substance is found)."
5740,What do abnormal results mean?,"Elevated levels of alcohol or prescription drugs can be a sign of intentional or accidental intoxication or overdose.
The presence of illegal drugs or drugs not prescribed for the person indicates illicit drug use."
5741,What are the risks?,"Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:
Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling light-headed Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)"
5742,What are the symptoms of Acute respiratory distress syndrome?,"Labored, rapid breathing Low blood pressure and organ failure Shortness of breath
Symptoms usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of the original injury or illness. Often, people with ARDS are so sick they are unable to complain of symptoms."
5743,What causes Acute respiratory distress syndrome?,"ARDS can be caused by any major swelling (inflammation) or injury to the lung. Some common causes include:
Breathing vomit into the lungs (aspiration) Inhaling chemicals Pneumonia Septic shock Trauma
ARDS leads to a buildup of fluid in the air sacs. This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream.
The fluid buildup also makes the lungs heavy and stiff, and decreases the lungs' ability to expand. The level of oxygen in the blood can stay dangerously low, even if the person receives oxygen from a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) through a breathing tube (endotracheal tube). ARDS often occurs along with the failure of other organ systems, such as the liver or the kidneys. Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use may be risk factors."
5744,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Acute respiratory distress syndrome ?,"Usually, ARDS occurs during another illness, for which the patient is already in the hospital. Occasionally, a healthy person may develop severe pneumonia that gets worse and becomes ARDS. If you have trouble breathing, call your local emergency number (such as 911) or go to the emergency room."
5745,What to expect if I have Acute respiratory distress syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"About a third of people with ARDS die from the disease. Survivors usually get back normal lung function, but many people have permanent, usually mild, lung damage. Many people who survive ARDS have memory loss or other problems with thinking after they recover. This is due to brain damage that occurred when the lungs weren't working properly and the brain wasn't getting enough oxygen."
5746,What are the symptoms of Asbestosis?,"Chest pain Cough Shortness of breath with exertion (slowly gets worse over time) Tightness in the chest
Possible other symptoms include:
Clubbing of fingers Nail abnormalities"
5747,What causes Asbestosis?,"Breathing in asbestos fibers can cause scar tissue (fibrosis) to form inside the lung. Scarred lung tissue does not expand and contract normally.
How severe the disease is depends on how long the person was exposed to asbestos and the amount he or she breathed in. Often, people do not notice symptoms for 20 years or more after the asbestos exposure.
Asbestos fibers were commonly used in construction before 1975. Asbestos exposure occured in asbestos mining and milling, construction, fireproofing, and other industries. Families of asbestos workers can also be exposed from particles brought home on the worker's clothing.
Other asbestos-related diseases include:
Pleural plaques (calcification) Malignant mesothelioma -- can develop 20-40 years after exposure Pleural effusion -- a collection that develops around the lung a few years after asbestos exposure
Workers today are less likely to get asbestos-related diseases because of government regulations.
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of getting asbestos-related diseases."
5748,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Asbestosis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you suspect that you've been exposed to asbestos or if you have unexplained symptoms.
5749,What to expect if I have Asbestosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on the amount of asbestos you were exposed to, and for how long. This condition tends to get worse more slowly than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis if you stop being exposed to asbestos.
Patients who develop malignant mesothelioma tend to have a poor outcome. About 75% of those who are affected die within 1 year."
5750,What are the symptoms of Aspiration pneumonia ?,"Bluish discoloration of the skin caused by lack of oxygen Chest pain Cough with Foul-smelling phlegm (sputum) Pus Blood Greenish sputum
Fatigue Fever Shortness of breath Wheezing
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Breath odor Excessive sweating Swallowing difficulty"
5751,What causes Aspiration pneumonia?,"Risk factors for aspiration or breathing in of foreign material into the lungs are:
Being less alert due to medicines, illness, or other reasons Coma Disorders of the esophagus, the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach (esophageal stricture, gastroesophageal reflux) Drinking large amounts of alcohol Medicine to put you into a deep sleep for surgery (general anesthesia) Old age Poor gag reflex in people who are not alert (unconscious or semi-conscious) after a stroke or brain injury Problems with swallowing
Acidic material that is breathed into the lungs can cause severe lung injury. However, it may not necessarily lead to pneumonia."
5752,Who is at highest risk for Aspiration pneumonia ?,Patients with decreased immunity Bed-ridden patients
5753,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Aspiration pneumonia ?,"Call your health care provider, go to the emergency room, or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have:
Chest pain Chills Fever Shortness of breath Wheezing"
5754,What to expect if I have Aspiration pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outcome depends on:
The severity of the pneumonia The type of bacteria causing the pneumonia How much of the lungs are involved
If acute respiratory failure develops, the patient may have a long-term illness or die. Many people who have aspiration pneumonia have other serious health problems, which may affect the outlook for recovery."
5755,What are the symptoms of Atelectasis?,Chest pain Cough Breathing difficulty
5756,What causes Atelectasis?,"Atelectasis is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. It is common after surgery, or in patients who were in the hospital.
Risk factors for developing atelectasis include:
Anesthesia Foreign object in the airway (most common in children) Lung diseases Mucus that plugs the airway Pressure on the lung caused by a buildup of fluid between the ribs and the lungs (called a pleural effusion) Prolonged bed rest with few changes in position Shallow breathing (may be caused by painful breathing) Tumors that block an airway"
5757,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atelectasis ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of atelectasis.
5758,What to expect if I have Atelectasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In an adult, atelectasis in a small area of the lung is usually not life threatening. The rest of the lung can make up for the collapsed area, bringing in enough oxygen for the body to function. Large areas of atelectases may be life threatening, especially in a baby or small child, or someone who has another lung disease or illness. The collapsed lung usually reinflates slowly if the blockage of the airway has been removed. However, some scarring or damage may remain."
5759,What are the symptoms of Atypical pneumonia?,"Pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydophila bacteria is usually mild.
Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila gets worse during the first 4 - 6 days, and then improves over 4 - 5 days. Even though symptoms will improve, it may take a while for them to go away completely.
The most common symptoms of pneumonia are:
Chills. Cough (with Legionella pneumonia, you may cough up bloody mucus). Fever, which may be mild or high. Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs).
Other symptoms include:
Chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough. Confusion, especially in older people or those with Legionella pneumonia. Headache. Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue. Muscle aches and joint stiffness. Sweating and clammy skin.
Less common symptoms include:
Diarrhea (especially with Legionella pneumonia). Ear pain (with mycoplasma pneumonia). Eye pain or soreness (with mycoplasma pneumonia). Neck lump (with mycoplasma pneumonia). Rash (with mycoplasma pneumonia). Sore throat (with mycoplasma pneumonia)."
5760,What causes Atypical pneumonia?,"Mycoplasma pneumonia is a type of atypical pneumonia. It is caused by the bacteria M. pneumoniae. It typically affects people younger than age 40. Pneumonia due to chlamydia-related bacteria occurs year round and accounts for 5 - 15% of all pneumonias. It is usually mild. Pneumonia due to Legionella is seen more often in middle-aged and older adults, smokers, and those with chronic illnesses or a weak immune system."
5761,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Atypical pneumonia ?,"Contact your health care provider if you develop fever, cough, or shortness of breath. There are numerous causes for these symptoms. The doctor will need to rule out pneumonia."
5762,What to expect if I have Atypical pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most patients with pneumonia due to mycoplasma or chlamydophila do well with the right antibiotic therapy. P.Legionella can be severe, leading to problems such as kidney failure, diabetes, COPD, a weak immune system, and death."
5763,What are the symptoms of Bronchiectasis?,"Symptoms often develop gradually, and may occur months or years after the event that causes the bronchiectasis.
They may include:
Bluish skin color Breath odor Chronic cough with large amounts of foul-smelling sputum Clubbing of fingers Coughing up blood Cough that gets worse when lying on one side Fatigue Paleness Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise Weight loss Wheezing"
5764,What causes Bronchiectasis?,"Bronchiectasis is often caused by recurrent inflammation or infection of the airways. It most often begins in childhood as a complication from infection or inhaling a foreign object.
Cystic fibrosis causes about half of all bronchiectasis in the United States.
The condition can also be caused by routinely breathing in food particles while eating."
5765,Who is at highest risk for Bronchiectasis ?,"Recurrent, severe lung infections (pneumonia, tuberculosis, fungal infections), abnormal lung defenses, and obstruction of the airways by a foreign body or tumor are some of the risk factors."
5766,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bronchiectasis ?,"Call your health care provider if:
Chest pain or shortness of breath gets worse There is a change in color or amount of the phlegm you cough up, or if it is bloody Other symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment"
5767,What to expect if I have Bronchiectasis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"With treatment, most people can lead normal lives without major disability."
5768,What are the symptoms of Bronchitis?,"The symptoms of either type of bronchitis may include:
Chest discomfort Cough that produces mucus; if it's yellow-green, you are more likely to have a bacterial infection Fatigue Fever -- usually low Shortness of breath worsened by exertion or mild activity Wheezing
Even after acute bronchitis has cleared, you may have a dry, nagging cough that lingers for several weeks.
Additional symptoms of chronic bronchitis include:
Ankle, feet, and leg swelling Blue-colored lips from low levels of oxygen Frequent respiratory infections (such as colds or the flu)"
5769,What causes Bronchitis?,"Acute bronchitis generally follows a viral respiratory infection. At first, it affects your nose, sinuses, and throat and then spreads to the lungs. Sometimes, you may get another (secondary) bacterial infection in the airways. This means that bacteria infect the airways, in addition to the virus.
Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition. People have a cough that produces excessive mucus. To be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, you must have a cough with mucus most days of the month for at least 3 months.
Chronic bronchitis is one type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD for short. (Emphysema is another type of COPD.)
The following things can make bronchitis worse:
Air pollution Allergies Certain occupations (such as coal mining, textile manufacturing, or grain handling) Infections"
5770,Who is at highest risk for Bronchitis ?,"People at risk for acute bronchitis include:
The elderly, infants, and young children Persons with heart or lung disease Smokers"
5771,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Bronchitis ?,"Call your doctor if:
You have a cough most days or you have a cough that returns frequently You are coughing up blood You have a high fever or shaking chills You have a low-grade fever for 3 or more days You have thick, greenish mucus, especially if it has a bad smell You feel short of breath or have chest pain You have an underlying chronic illness, like heart or lung disease"
5772,What to expect if I have Bronchitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"For acute bronchitis, symptoms usually go away within 7 to 10 days if you do not have an underlying lung disorder. However, a dry, hacking cough can linger for a number of months.
The chance for recovery is poor for persons with advanced chronic bronchitis. Early recognition and treatment, combined with smoking cessation, significantly improve the chance of a good outcome."
5773,How is the Chest tube insertion done?,"Chest tubes are inserted to drain blood, fluid, or air and to allow the lungs to fully expand. The tube is placed between the ribs and into the space between the inner lining and the outer lining of the lung (pleural space).
The area where the tube will be inserted is numbed (local anesthesia). Sometimes you will be given medication to make you relaxed and sleepy (sedation) through a vein (intravenously).
The chest tube is inserted through a one-inch cut in the skin between the ribs into the chest. It is connected to a bottle or canister that contains sterile water. Suction is attached to the system for drainage. A stitch (suture) and adhesive tape keep the tube in place. After every chest tube insertion, a chest x-ray is done to make sure it is in the right place.
The chest tube usually stays in place until x-rays show that all the blood, fluid, or air has drained from the chest and the lung has fully re-expanded. When the chest tube is no longer needed, it can be easily removed. Most people don't need medications to sedate or numb them while the chest tube is removed. Antibiotics may be used to prevent or treat infection.
In certain people, the chest tube may be inserted using a minimally invasive technique guided by x-ray or ultrasound. Chest tubes are usually placed during major lung or heart surgery while the person is under general anesthesia."
5774,Who needs Chest tube insertion?,"Chest tubes are used to treat conditions that can cause the lung to collapse, such as:
After surgery or trauma in the chest (pneumothorax or hemothorax). Air leaks from the lung into the chest (pneumothorax). Bleeding into the chest (hemothorax). Collection of fat in the chest (chylothorax). Lung abscesses or pus in the chest (empyema)."
5775,Where to find centers that perform Chest tube insertion?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Chest tube insertion
5776,What to expect if I have Chest tube insertion  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"You will stay in the hospital until the chest tube is removed. While the chest tube is in place, the nursing staff will carefully check for possible air leaks, breathing difficulties, and the need for oxygen. You'll need to breathe deeply and cough often to help re-expand the lung, help with drainage, and prevent fluids from collecting in the lungs. Chest x-rays are done often while a chest tube is in place to make sure that all of the air, blood, and other fluids are being removed."
5777,What are the symptoms of CMV pneumonitis?,"Cough. Fatigue. Fever. General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise). Loss of appetite. Muscle aches or joint pains. Shortness of breath. Shortness of breath on exertion. Sweating, excessive (night sweats).
Low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxemia) with CMV pneumonia often predicts death, especially in patients who need mechanical ventilation."
5778,What causes CMV pneumonitis?,"CMV pneumonia is caused by a member of a group of herpes-type viruses. Infection with CMV is very common. Most humans are exposed to CMV in their lifetime, but typically only individuals with weakened immune systems become ill from CMV infection
Usually CMV produces no symptoms, but serious CMV infections can occur in people with weakened immune systems from conditions such as:
AIDS. Bone marrow transplant. Organ transplant. Chemotherapy or other treatments that suppress the immune system.
In people who have had organ and bone marrow transplants, the risk of infection is greatest 5 - 13 weeks after the transplant."
5779,When to seek urgent medical care when I have CMV pneumonitis ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of CMV pneumonia.
5780,What to expect if I have CMV pneumonitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Antiviral medications stop the virus from copying itself, but do not destroy it. CMV itself suppresses the immune system, and may increase the risk of other infections due to the additional immunosuppression."
5781,What are the symptoms of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia?,"Patients with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia may have a positive history of connective tissue diseases, drug intake, malignancy and other interstitial lung disease. Common symptoms are dry cough, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue and weight loss. Less common symptoms are hemoptysis, chest pain and night sweats."
5782,What causes of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia?,"Some of the causes of organizing pneumonia include infectious agents, drugs, inflammatory diseases, and toxic exposures."
5783,Who is at highest risk for Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ?,"Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia affects men and women equally, usually beginning between the ages of 40 and 60."
5784,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ?,"When there is worsening shortness of breath, dry cough changed to a productive cough."
5785,What to expect if I have Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The overall prognosis for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is significantly better than that of other interstitial lung diseases. Recovery occurs in approximately 2/3 of patients treated with steroids, with symptoms generally clearing over several months."
5786,When does an inhaler need to be replaced?,"A metered dose inhaler contains enough medication for a certain number of puffs which is printed on the canister. Even though the inhaler may continue to work beyond that number of uses, the amount of medication delivered may not be correct. It is important to keep track of the number of times an inhaler was used, so that it can be replaced after its recommended number of uses. The manufacturer of Ventolin has addressed this issue by adding in a counter to the mouthpiece, as has the manufacturer of Advair. Also, depending on the manufacturer, inhalers are sold as a complete unit or the individual canister as a refill prescription."
5787,How Does Tobacco Deliver its Effects?,"There are more than 4,000 chemicals found in the smoke of tobacco products. Of these, nicotine, first identified in the early 1800s, is the primary reinforcing component of tobacco that acts on the brain.
Cigarette smoking is the most popular method of using tobacco; however, there has also been a recent increase in the sale and consumption of smokeless tobacco products, such as snuff and chewing tobacco. These smokeless products also contain nicotine, as well as many toxic chemicals.
The cigarette is a very efficient and highly engineered drug delivery system. By inhaling tobacco smoke, the average smoker takes in 1 to 2 mg of nicotine per cigarette8. When tobacco is smoked, nicotine rapidly reaches peak levels in the bloodstream and enters the brain. A typical smoker will take 10 puffs on a cigarette over a period of 5 minutes that the cigarette is lit. Thus, a person who smokes about 1-1/2 packs (30 cigarettes) daily gets 300 “hits” of nicotine to the brain each day. In those who typically do not inhale the smoke—such as cigar and pipe smokers and smokeless tobacco users – nicotine is absorbed through the mucosal membranes and reaches peak blood levels and the brain more slowly.
Immediately after exposure to nicotine, there is a “kick” caused in part by the drug’s stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The rush of adrenaline stimulates the body and causes a sudden release of glucose, as well as an increase in blood pressure, respiration, and heart rate9. Nicotine also suppresses insulin output from the pancreas, which means that smokers are always slightly hyperglycemic (i.e., they have elevated blood sugar levels10). The calming effect of nicotine reported by many users is usually associated with a decline in withdrawal effects rather than direct effects of nicotine."
5788,Is Nicotine Addictive?,"Yes. Most smokers use tobacco regularly because they are addicted to nicotine. Addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, even in the face of negative health consequences. It is well documented that most smokers identify tobacco use as harmful and express a desire to reduce or stop using it, and nearly 35 million of them want to quit each year7. Unfortunately, only about 6 percent of people who try to quit are successful for more than a month.
Research has shown how nicotine acts on the brain to produce a number of effects. Of primary importance to its addictive nature are findings that nicotine activates reward pathways—the brain circuitry that regulates feelings of pleasure. A key brain chemical involved in mediating the desire to consume drugs is the neurotransmitter dopamine, and research has shown that nicotine increases levels of dopamine in the reward circuits. This reaction is similar to that seen with other drugs of abuse, and is thought to underlie the pleasurable sensations experienced by many smokers9. Nicotine’s pharmacokinetic properties also enhance its abuse potential. Cigarette smoking produces a rapid distribution of nicotine to the brain, with drug levels peaking within 10 seconds of inhalation9. However, the acute effects of nicotine dissipate in a few minutes, as do the associated feelings of reward, which causes the smoker to continue dosing to maintain the drug’s pleasurable effects and prevent withdrawal.
Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include irritability, craving, cognitive and attentional deficits, sleep disturbances, and increased appetite. These symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last cigarette, quickly driving people back to tobacco use. Symptoms peak within the first few days of smoking cessation and may subside within a few weeks. For some people, however, symptoms may persist for months.
While withdrawal is related to the pharmacological effects of nicotine, many behavioral factors can also affect the severity of withdrawal symptoms. For some people, the feel, smell, and sight of a cigarette and the ritual of obtaining, handling, lighting, and smoking the cigarette are all associated with the pleasurable effects of smoking and can make withdrawal or craving worse. While nicotine gum and patches may alleviate the pharmacological aspects of withdrawal, cravings often persist. Other forms of nicotine replacement, such as inhalers, attempt to address some of these other issues, while behavioral therapies can help smokers identify environmental triggers of withdrawal and craving so they can employ strategies to prevent or circumvent these symptoms and urges."
5789,What are the symptoms of Obesity hypoventilation syndrome?,"The main symptoms of OHS are due to lack of sleep and include:
Excessive daytime sleepiness. Falling asleep during the day. Increased risk for accidents or mistakes at work. Depression.
Symptoms of low blood oxygen level (chronic hypoxia) can also occur, such as shortness of breath or feeling tired after very little effort."
5790,What causes Obesity hypoventilation syndrome?,"The exact cause of OHS in unknown. Most (but not all) patients with the syndrome have a form of sleep apnea.
OHS is believed to result from both a defect in the brain's control over breathing, and excessive weight (due to obesity) against the chest wall, which makes it hard for a person to take a deep breath. As a result, the blood has too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen. People with OHS are often tired due to sleep loss, poor sleep quality, and chronic hypoxia.
Excess (morbid) obesity is the main risk factor."
5791,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Obesity hypoventilation syndrome ?,"Call your health care provider if you are very tired during the day, or have any other symptoms that suggest OHS."
5792,What to expect if I have Obesity hypoventilation syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Untreated, it can lead to serious heart and blood vessel problems, severe disability, or death. Chronic sleeping problems may also increase the chance of having a motor vehicle accident."
5793,What are the symptoms of Pleural empyema?,"Chest pain, which worsens when you breathe in deeply (pleurisy). Dry cough. Excessive sweating, especially night sweats. Fever and chills. General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise). Shortness of breath. Weight loss (unintentional)."
5794,What causes Pleural empyema?,"Empyema is usually caused by an infection that spreads from the lung. It leads to a buildup of pus in the pleural space.
There can be a pint or more of infected fluid. This fluid puts pressure on the lungs.
Risk factors include:
Bacterial pneumonia. Chest surgery. Lung abscess. Trauma or injury to the chest.
In rare cases, empyema can occur after a needle is inserted through the chest wall to draw off fluid in the pleural space for medical diagnosis or treatment (thoracentesis)."
5795,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pleural empyema ?,Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of empyema.
5796,What to expect if I have Pleural empyema  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"When empyema complicates pneumonia, the risk of permanent lung damage and death goes up. Patients will need long-term treatment with antibiotics and drainage. However, most people fully recover from empyema."
5797,What are the symptoms of Pneumoconiosis?,Cough. Shortness of breath.
5798,What causes Pneumoconiosis?,"Coal worker's pneumoconiosis occurs in two forms: simple and complicated (also called progressive massive fibrosis, or PMF).
Your risk of getting coal worker's pneumoconiosis depends on how long you have been around coal dust. Most people with this disease are older than 50. Smoking does not increase your risk of developing this disease, but it may have an additional harmful effect on the lungs.
If coal worker's pneumoconiosis occurs with rheumatoid arthritis, it is called Caplan syndrome."
5799,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pneumoconiosis ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you develop symptoms of coal worker's pneumoconiosis.
5800,What to expect if I have Pneumoconiosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The outcome for the simple form is usually good. It rarely causes disability or death. The complicated form may cause shortness of breath that gets progressively worse.
5801,What are the symptoms of Psittacosis?,Blood-tinged sputum Dry cough Fatigue Fever and chills Headache Joint aches Muscle aches Shortness of breath
5802,What causes Psittacosis?,"Psittacosis is a rare disease: 100 - 200 cases are reported each year in the United States.
Bird owners, pet shop employees, persons who work in poultry processing plants, and veterinarians are at increased risk for this infection. Typical birds involved are parrots, parakeets, and budgerigars, although other birds have also caused the disease."
5803,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Psittacosis patient information?,"Antibiotics are needed to treat this infection. If you develop symptoms of psittacosis, call your health care provider."
5804,What to expect if I have Psittacosis patient information (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Full recovery is expected.
5805,What are the symptoms of Solitary Pulmonary Nodule?,There are usually no symptoms.
5806,What causes Solitary Pulmonary Nodule?,"More than half of all solitary pulmonary are noncancerous (benign). Benign nodules have many causes, including old scars and infections. Infectious granulomas are the cause of most benign lesions. You have a greater risk for developing a solitary pulmonary nodule if you have:
Tuberculosis or been exposed to TB Infectious lung diseases caused by fungus, such as: Histoplasmosis Coccidioidomycosis Cryptococcosis Aspergillosis
However, the above conditions makes it more likely that the solitary pulmonary nodule is noncancerous. Young age, history of not smoking, calcium in the lesion, and small lesion size are factors associated with a noncancerous diagnosis. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancerous (malignant) pulmonary nodules."
5807,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Pulmonary nodule ?,A solitary pulmonary nodule is usually found by your health care professional when a chest x-ray is performed for some other reason.
5808,What to expect if I have Pulmonary nodule  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook is generally good if the nodule is benign. If the nodule does not grow larger over a 2-year period, under most circumstances nothing more need be done. On occasion, the appearance of the nodule on CT scan may warrant continued follow-up."
5809,What are the symptoms of Sarcoidosis ?,"There may be no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can involve almost any body part or organ system in your body.
Almost all patients have lung or chest symptoms:
Chest pain (most often behind your breast bone) Dry cough Shortness of breath
Symptoms of general discomfort or uneasiness often occur:
Fatigue (one of the most common symptoms in children) Fever Joint achiness or pain (arthralgia) Overall feeling of discomfort, illness, or lack of well-being Weight loss (one of the most common symptoms in children)
Skin symptoms:
Hair loss Raised, red, firm skin sores (erythema nodosum), almost always on the front part of the lower legs Rash Scars that become raised or inflamed
Nervous system symptoms may include:
Headache Seizures Weakness on one side of the face
Eye symptoms include:
Burning Discharge from the eye Dry eyes Itching Pain Vision loss
Other symptoms of this disease:
Dry mouth Fainting spells if the heart is involved Nosebleed Swelling in the upper part of the abdomen"
5810,What are the causes of Sarcoidosis ?,"The cause of the disease is unknown. In sarcoidosis, tiny clumps of abnormal tissue (granulomas) form in certain organs of the body. Granulomas are clusters of immune cells.
The disease can affect almost any organ of the body, but it most commonly affects the lungs.
Possible causes of sarcoidosis include:
Extreme immune response to infection High sensitivity to environmental factors Genetic factors"
5811,Who is at highest risk for Sarcoidosis ?,"The condition is more common in African Americans than Caucasians, especially in Caucasians of Scandinavian heritage. Females are usually affected more often than males. The disease typically begins between ages 20 and 40. Sarcoidosis is very rare in young children. A person with a close blood relative who has sarcoidosis is nearly five times as likely to develop the condition."
5812,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Sarcoidosis ?,"Call your health care provider if you have:
Difficulty breathing Palpitations Vision changes Other symptoms of this disorder"
5813,What to expect if I have Sarcoidosis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many people with sarcoidosis are not seriously ill, and the disease may get better without treatment. About 30 - 50% of cases get better without treatment in 3 years. About 20% of people whose lungs are involved will develop lung damage.
The overall death rate from sarcoidosis is less than 5%. Causes of death include:
Bleeding from the lung tissue Heart damage, leading to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms Lung scarring (pulmonary fibrosis)"
5814,When the diagnosis can be made without performing a tissue biopsy?,"in some clinical scenarios, the presentation is so specific that the diagnosis can be made without a confirmatory tissue biopsy .
Lupus pernio Lofgren syndrome Heerfordt syndrome Bilateral hilar adenopathy on CXR without symptoms Positive panda and/or lambda sign on gallium scan"
5815,How is the Thoracentesis done?,"A small area of skin on your back is cleaned. Numbing medicine (local anesthetic) is injected in this area.
A needle is placed through the skin and muscles of the chest wall into the space around the lungs, called the pleural space. Fluid is collected and may be sent to a laboratory for testing (pleural fluid analysis). You will sit on a bed or on the edge of a chair or bed. Your head and arms will rest on a table.
The skin around the procedure site is cleaned and the area is draped. A local numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin. The thoracentesis needle is inserted above the rib into the pleural space.
You will feel a stinging sensation when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pain or pressure when the needle is inserted into the pleural space.
Tell your health care provider if you feel shortness of breath or chest pain."
5816,Who needs Thoracentesis?,"Normally, very little fluid is in the pleural space. A buildup of too much fluid between the layers of the pleura is called a pleural effusion.
The test is performed to determine the cause of the extra fluid, or to relieve symptoms from the fluid buildup.
The test may be also performed for the following conditions:
Asbestos-related pleural effusion. Collagen vascular disease. Drug reactions. Hemothorax. Pancreatitis. Pneumonia. Pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Thyroid disease."
5817,Where to find centers that perform Thoracentesis?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Thoracentesis
5818,What to expect if I have Thoracentesis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Normal Results
Normally the pleural cavity contains only a very small amount of fluid.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Testing the fluid will help your health care provider determine the cause of pleural effusion. Possible causes include:
Cancer Cirrhosis Heart failure Infection Inflammation Malnutrition Kidney disease
If your health care provider suspects that you have an infection, a culture of the fluid may be done to test for bacteria."
5819,What are the symptoms of Upper respiratory tract infection?,"Itchy, watery eyes Nasal discharge Nasal congestion Sneezing Sore throat Cough Headache Fever Malaise Fatigue, weakness Muscle pain"
5820,What causes Upper respiratory tract infection?,"You can catch a cold if:
A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you. You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.
People are most contagious for the first 2 to 3 days of a cold. A cold is usually not contagious after the first week."
5821,Who is at highest risk for Upper respiratory tract infection ?,"Any one can have common cold but children, older population, people with decreased immunity are affected more commonly."
5822,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Upper respiratory tract infection ?,If you have the above symptoms contact a doctor.
5823,What to expect if I have Upper respiratory tract infection  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"An upper respiratory tract infection usually gets better after a few days, and it normally has a good prognosis."

Cough (with some pneumonias you may cough up mucus, or even bloody mucus) Fever, which may be mild or high Shaking chills Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs)
Other symptoms include:
Confusion, especially in older people Excessive sweating and clammy skin Headache Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough Fatigue"
5825,What causes Viral pneumonia?,"Viral pneumonia is more likely to occur in young children and older adults, because their bodies have a harder time fighting off the virus. Viral pneumonia is most often caused by one of several viruses:
Adenovirus Influenza Parainfluenza Respiratory syncytial virus
People who are at risk for more serious viral pneumonia often have a weakened immune system, including:
Adult HIV / AIDS patients Babies who are born too early Children with heart and lung problems People receiving chemotherapy for cancer, or other medications that weaken the immune system. Organ transplant recipients"
5826,What to expect if I have Viral pneumonia  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild and get better without treatment within 1 - 3 weeks, but some cases are more serious and require hospitalization."
5827,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Viral pneumonia ?,Call your health care provider if symptoms of viral pneumonia develop.
5828,What are the symptoms of Acute low back pain?,"You may feel a variety of symptoms if you've hurt your back. You may have a tingling or burning sensation, a dull achy feeling, or sharp pain. Depending on the cause, you also may have weakness in your legs or feet.
Low back pain can vary widely. The pain may be mild, or it can be so severe that you are unable to move. Depending on the cause of your back pain, you may also have pain in your leg, hip, or bottom of your foot."
5829,What causes Acute low back pain?,"If you are like most people, you will have at least one backache in your life. While such pain or discomfort can happen anywhere in your back, the most common area affected is your low back. This is because the low back supports most of your body's weight.
Low back pain is the number two reason that Americans see their doctor-- second only to colds and flus. Many back-related injuries happen at work. But you can change that. There are many things you can do to lower your chances of getting back pain.
You'll usually first feel back pain just after you lift a heavy object, move suddenly, sit in one position for a long time, or have an injury or accident. But before that injury or accident, the structures in your back were losing strength or changing.
Acute low back pain is most often caused by a sudden injury to the muscles, ligaments, bones, and nerves in the spine. The source of the pain may be:
Compression fractures to the spine from osteoporosis Muscle spasm (very tense muscles that remain contracted) Ruptured or herniated disk Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) Spine curvatures (like scoliosis or kyphosis), which may be inherited and seen in children or teens Strain or tears to the muscles or ligaments supporting the back
Back pain may also be due to:
An abnormal aortic aneurysm that is leaking Arthritis conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis Cancer that involves the spine Fibromyalgia Infection of the spine (osteomyelitis, diskitis, abscess) Kidney infection or kidney stones Problems related to pregnancy Medical conditions that affect the female reproductive organs, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids"

Back pain after a severe blow or fall Burning with urination or blood in your urine History of cancer Loss of control over urine or stool (incontinence) Pain traveling down your legs below the knee Pain that is worse when you lie down or that wakes you up at night Redness or swelling on the back or spine Severe pain that does not allow you to get comfortable Unexplained fever with back pain Weakness or numbness in your buttocks, thigh, leg, or pelvis
Also call if:
You have been losing weight unintentionally You use steroids or intravenous drugs. You have had back pain before, but this episode is different and feels worse. This episode of back pain has lasted longer than 4 weeks."
5832,What to expect if I have Acute low back pain  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Many people will feel better within 1 week after the start of back pain. After another 4-6 weeks, the back pain will likely be completely gone."
5833,What causes Arthralgia?,"Joint pain can be caused by many types of injuries or conditions. No matter what causes it, joint pain can be very bothersome. Some things that can cause joint pain are:
A utoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus Bursitis Chondromalacia patellae Gout (especially found in the big toe) Infections caused by a virus, including Epstein-Barr viral syndrome Hepatitis Influenza (flu) Lyme disease Measles (rubeola) Mumps Parvovirus Rheumatic fever Rubella (German measles) Varicella (chickenpox) Injury, such as a fracture Osteoarthritis Osteomyelitis (bone infection) Septic arthritis (joint infection) Tendinitis Unusual exertion or overuse, including strains or sprain."
5834,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Arthralgia ?,"Contact your health care provider if:
You have fever that is not associated with flu symptoms.
You have lost 10 pounds or more without trying (unintended weight loss).
Your joint pain lasts for more than 3 days.
You have severe, unexplained joint pain, particularly if you have other unexplained symptoms."
5835,What are the symptoms of Chronic low back pain?,"You may feel a variety of symptoms if you have hurt your back, including:
Tingling or burning sensation Dull aching Sharp pain Weakness in your legs or feet
Low back pain can vary widely. The pain may be mild, or it can be so severe that you are unable to move. Depending on the cause of your back pain, you may also have pain in your leg, hip, or bottom of your foot. See: Sciatica"
5836,What causes Chronic low back pain?,"One single event may not cause your pain. You may have been doing many things improperly-- such as standing or lifting-- for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement (such as reaching for something or bending from your waist) leads to the feeling of pain.
The specific part of your back that is responsible for your pain is sometimes difficult to identify. There are several possible causes of low back pain:
Certain medical conditions such as fibromyalgia Herniated disc (part of a spinal disc pushes onto nearby nerves) Strain or tears to the muscles or ligaments supporting the back Degenerative disc disease Pelvic injury or fracture Piriformis syndrome (a pain disorder involving a narrow muscle in the buttocks) Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) Small fractures to the spine from osteoporosis Spine curvatures (such as scoliosis or kyphosis), which may be inherited and seen in children and teens"

5841,What causes Dupuytren's contracture?,"The cause is unknown, but minor injury and your genes may make you more likely to develop this condition.
One or both hands may be affected. The ring finger is affected most often, followed by the little, middle, and index fingers.
A small, painless nodule develops in the connective tissue on the palm side of the hand and eventually develops into a cord-like band. In severe cases, it's difficult or even impossible to extend the fingers."
5842,Who is at highest risk for Dupuytren%27s contracture ?,"The condition becomes more common after the age of 40. Men are affected more often than women. Risk factors are alcoholism, epilepsy, pulmonary tuberculosis, diabetes, and liver disease."
5843,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Dupuytren%27s contracture ?,Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of this disorder.
5844,What to expect if I have Dupuytren%27s contracture  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,The disorder progresses at an unpredictable rate. Surgical treatment can usually restore normal movement to the fingers. The disease can recur following surgery in some cases.

5846,What causes Eosinophilic fasciitis?,"The cause of eosinophilic fasciitis is unknown. Fewer than 300 cases have been reported in the past 35 years.
People with this condition have a buildup of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the affected fascia and muscles. Eosinophils are related to allergic reactions, but their exact function is unknown."
5847,Who is at highest risk for Eosinophilic fasciitis ?,"The syndrome affects people of any age, but is more common in people ages 30 to 60."
5848,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Eosinophilic fasciitis ?,Call your health care provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of this disorder.
5849,What to expect if I have Eosinophilic fasciitis  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In most cases, the condition goes away within 3 to 5 years. However, symptoms may return (recur) or persist. The outlook is much worse if blood diseases occur."
5850,What are the symptoms of Kyphosis?,"Patients with kyphosis may experience the following symptoms. With the disease progresses, patients may show symptoms of cardiac and pulmonary problems.
Appearance of hunchback Fatigue Back pain Tenderness and stiffness in the back Shortness of breath Chest pain"

Other symptoms may include:
Hip stiffness that restricts movement in the hip Knee pain Limited range of motion Persistent thigh or groin pain Shortening of the leg, or legs of unequal length Wasting of muscles in the upper thigh"
5855,What causes Legg-Calvé-Perthes syndrome?,"There are many theories about the cause of this disease, but little is actually known.
Without enough blood to the area, the bone dies. The ball of the hip will collapse and become flat. Usually only one hip is affected, although it can occur on both sides.
The blood supply returns over several months, bringing in new bone cells. The new cells gradually replace the dead bone over 2 - 3 years."
5856,Who is at highest risk for Legg-Calv%C3%A9-Perthes syndrome ?,Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 - 10 years old.
5857,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Legg-Calv%C3%A9-Perthes syndrome ?,Call for an appointment with your health care provider if a child develops any symptoms of this disorder.
5858,What to expect if I have Legg-Calv%C3%A9-Perthes syndrome  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"The outlook depends on the child's age and the severity of the disease. In general, the younger the child is when the disease starts, the better the outcome.
Children younger than 6 years old who receive treatment are more likely to end up with a normal hip joint. Children older than age 6 are more likely to end up with a deformed hip joint, despite treatment, and may later develop arthritis."
5859,What are the Symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease?,"Symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease include:
General feeling of being unwell: This malaise may be accompanied by increased fatigue and a mild fever. Cold and numb fingers or toes (Raynaud's phenomenon): In response to cold or stress, your fingers or toes might turn white and then purplish blue. After warming, the fingers or toes turn red. Swollen fingers or hands: Some people experience swelling to the point where the fingers resemble sausages. Muscle and joint pain: Joints may become deformed, similar to what occurs with rheumatoid arthritis. Rash: Red or reddish brown patches may appear over the knuckles."
5860,What Causes mixed connective tissue disease?,"The precise cause of mixed connective tissue disease is not known. Mixed connective tissue disease is an autoimmune disorder. In autoimmune disorders, your immune system (responsible for fighting off disease) mistakenly attacks healthy cells. In connective tissue diseases, your immune system attacks the fibers that provide the framework and support for your body. Researchers are working to identify proteins produced by the immune system that might cause mixed connective tissue disease. Some people with MCTD have a family history of the condition. But the role of genetics in causing the disease remains unclear."
5861,Who is at highest risk for Mixed connective tissue disease ?,"Mixed connective tissue disease can occur in people of any age. However, it appears to be most common in women under the age of 30."
5862,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mixed connective tissue disease ?,See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms that interfere with your daily routine — particularly if you've already been diagnosed with lupus or another connective tissue disease.
5863,Where to find Medical Care for mixed connective tissue disease?,Medical care for mixed connective tissue disease can be found here.
5864,What to expect if I have Mixed connective tissue disease  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In MCTD, prognosis depends on the type of organ involvement. The worst prognosis and high mortality rate are associated with the presence of pulmonary involvement."
5865,What are the symptoms of Osteoarthritis?,"Symptoms of osteoarthritis vary from person to person. For most patients, it develops slowly and worsens over time. Usual signs and symptoms include:
Joint pain, gets worse during or after movement. Pain increases during humid or moist weather.

Arm weakness or pain with use Chest pain Dizziness / lightheadedness Fatigue Fever Joint or muscle pain Skin rash Night sweats Vision changes Weight loss Decreased radial pulses (at the wrist) Difference in blood pressure between the two arms High blood pressure (hypertension)"
5887,What Causes Takayasu's arteritis?,"The cause of Takayasu arteritis is unknown. The disease occurs mainly in children and women between the ages of 20 to 40. It is more common in people of East Asian, Indian or Mexican descent. However, it is now being seen more often in other parts of the world. Several genes that increase the chance of having this problem were recently found. Takayasu arteritis appears to be an autoimmune condition. This means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The condition may also involve other organ systems. Takayasu arteritis has many features that are similar to giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) in older people."

5891,What are the symptoms of Tennis elbow?,Elbow pain that gradually worsens Pain radiating from the outside of the elbow to the forearm and back of the hand when grasping or twisting Weak grasp
5892,What causes Tennis elbow?,"The part of the muscle that attaches to a bone is called a tendon. Muscles in your forearm attach to the bone on the outside of your elbow.
When you use these muscles over and over again, small tears develop in the tendon. Over time, this leads to irritation and pain where the tendon is attached to the bone."
5893,Who is at highest risk for Tennis elbow ?,"This injury is common in people who play a lot of tennis or other racquet sports, hence the name ""tennis elbow."" Backhand is the most common stroke to cause symptoms.
However, any activity that involves repetitive twisting of the wrist (like using a screwdriver) can lead to this condition. Therefore, painters, plumbers, construction workers, cooks, and butchers are all more likely to develop tennis elbow.
This condition may also be due to constant computer keyboard and mouse use."
5894,When to seek urgent medical care when I have Tennis elbow ?,"Apply home treatment (over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications and keeping the elbow still) if:
Symptoms are mild You have had this disorder before and you are sure you have tennis elbow
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:
This is the first time you have had these symptoms Home treatment does not relieve the symptoms"
5895,What to expect if I have Tennis elbow  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Most people improve with nonsurgical treatment. The majority of those who do have surgery show an improvement in symptoms.
5896,How is an Amputation done?,"Amputations are done either by surgery, or they occur by accident or trauma to the body."
5897,Who needs an Amputation?,"Reasons for having an amputation of a lower limb are:
Severe trauma to the limb that is caused by an accident Poor blood flow to the limb Infections that do not go away or become worse and cannot be controlled or healed Tumors of the lower limb Severe burns or severe frostbite Wounds that do not heal"
5898,Where to find centers that perform Amputation?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Amputation
5899,What are the risks of Amputation?,"Risks for any surgery are:
Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs Breathing problems Bleeding
Risks for this surgery are:
A feeling that the limb is still there. This is called phantom sensation. Sometimes this feeling can be painful. That is called phantom pain. The joint closest to the part that is amputated loses its range of motion, making it hard to move. This is called joint contracture. Infection of the skin or bone. The amputation wound does not heal properly."
5900,What to expect before the procedure?,"When your amputation is planned, you will be asked to do certain things to prepare for it. Always tell your doctor or nurse:
What drugs you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol
During the days before your surgery, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot.
Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, stop.
If you have diabetes, follow your diet and take your medicines as usual until the day of surgery.
On the day of the surgery, most times you will be asked not to drink or eat anything for 8 to 12 hours before your surgery.
Take your drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. If you have diabetes, follow the directions your doctor gave you.
Prepare your home before surgery:
What help will you need when you come home from the hospital? Do you have a family member, friend, or neighbor who can help you? If not, ask your doctor or nurse for help planning for someone to come into your home. Is your bathroom and the rest of your house safe for you to move around in? Will you be able to get in and out of your home safely?"
5901,What to expect after the procedure?,"The end of your leg, or stump, will have a dressing and bandage that will remain on for 3 or more days. You may have pain for the first few days. You will be able to take pain medicine as you need them.
You may have a tube that drains fluid from the wound. This will be taken out after a few days.
Before leaving the hospital, you will begin learning how to:
Use a wheelchair or a walker Stretch your muscles to make them stronger Strengthen your arms and legs Begin walking with a walking aid and parallel bars Start moving around the bed and into the chair in your hospital room Keep your joints mobile Sit or lay in different positions to keep your joints from becoming stiff Control swelling in the area around your amputation Properly put weight on your leg. You'll be told how much weight to put on your leg. You may not be allowed to put weight on your leg until the stump is fully healed.
Fitting for prosthesis, a manmade part to replace your limb, may occur when:
Your amputation wound is mostly healed Your stump is no longer tender to the touch"
5902,How is Appendectomy done?,"The appendix is a small, finger-shaped organ that comes out from the first part of the large intestine. It is removed when it becomes swollen (inflamed) or infected. An appendix that has a hole in it (perforated) can leak and infect the entire abdomen area, which can be life-threatening.
If appendicitis is suspected, a doctor will often suggest surgery without conducting extensive diagnostic testing. Prompt surgery decreases the likelihood the appendix will burst. Surgery to remove the appendix is called appendectomy and can be done two ways.
The older method, called laparotomy, removes the appendix through a single incision in the lower right area of the abdomen. The newer method, called laparoscopic surgery, uses several smaller incisions and special surgical tools fed through the incisions to remove the appendix. Laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications, such as hospital-related infections, and has a shorter recovery time.
Surgery occasionally reveals a normal appendix. In such cases, many surgeons will remove the healthy appendix to eliminate the future possibility of appendicitis. Occasionally, surgery reveals a different problem, which may also be corrected during surgery. It is not clear if the appendix has an important role in the body. There are no major, long-term health problems resulting from removing the appendix although a slight increase in some diseases has been noted, for example, Crohn's disease.
Sometimes an abscess forms around a burst appendix—called an appendiceal abscess. An abscess is a pus-filled mass that results from the body's attempt to keep an infection from spreading. An abscess may be addressed during surgery or, more commonly, drained before surgery. To drain an abscess, a tube is placed in the abscess through the abdominal wall. CT is used to help find the abscess. The drainage tube is left in place for about 2 weeks while antibiotics are given to treat infection. Six to 8 weeks later, when infection and inflammation are under control, surgery is performed to remove what remains of the burst appendix.
An appendectomy is done using either:
Spinal anesthesia. Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. General anesthesia. You will be asleep and not feel any pain during the surgery."
5903,Who needs Appendectomy?,"An appendectomy is done for appendicitis. The condition can be hard to diagnose, especially in children, older people, and women of childbearing age.
Most often, the first symptom is pain around your belly button.
The pain may be mild at first, but it becomes sharp and severe. The pain often moves into your right lower abdomen and becomes more focused in this area.
Other symptoms include:
Diarrhea or constipation. Fever (usually not very high). Nausea and vomiting. Reduced appetite."
5904,Where to find centers that perform Appendectomy?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Appendicectomy
5905,What are the risks of Appendectomy?,"Risks from any anesthesia include the following:
Reactions to medications. Problems breathing.
Risks from any surgery include the following:
Bleeding. infection of the wound.
Other risks with an appendectomy after a ruptured appendix include the following:
Buildup of pus (abscess), which may need draining and antibiotics. Longer hospital stays. Side effects from medications."
5906,What to expect before the procedure?,"If you have symptoms of appendicitis, seek medical help right away. Do not use heating pads, enemas, laxatives, or other home treatments to try and relieve symptoms.
Your health care provider will examine your abdomen and rectum. Other tests may be done.
Laboratory tests
Blood tests are used to check for signs of infection, such as a high white blood cell count. Blood tests may also show dehydration or fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Urinalysis is used to rule out a urinary tract infection. Doctors may also order a pregnancy test for women.
Imaging tests
Computerized tomography (CT) scans, which create cross-sectional images of the body, can help diagnose appendicitis and other sources of abdominal pain. Ultrasound is sometimes used to look for signs of appendicitis, especially in people who are thin or young. An abdominal x-ray is rarely helpful in diagnosing appendicitis but can be used to look for other sources of abdominal pain. Women of childbearing age should have a pregnancy test before undergoing x-rays or CT scanning. Both use radiation and can be harmful to a developing fetus. Ultrasound does not use radiation and is not harmful to a fetus.
There are no actual tests to confirm that you have appendicitis. Other illnesses can cause the same or similar symptoms.
The goal is to remove an infected appendix before it breaks open (ruptures). After reviewing your symptoms and the results of the physical exam and medical tests, your surgeon will decide whether you need surgery."
5907,What to expect after the procedure?,"With adequate care, most people recover from appendicitis and do not need to make changes to diet, exercise, or lifestyle. Full recovery from surgery takes about 4 to 6 weeks. Limiting physical activity during this time allows tissues to heal.
After an uncomplicated appendectomy, your surgeon will usually advise you to:
Get up and walk around the day of the surgery. Keep the incision clean and dry. Avoid lifting. Avoid constipation and straining during bowel movements by drinking plenty of fluids and eating high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains; move your bowels as soon as you feel the urge.
The same advice often applies in the case of a ruptured appendix, but over a longer time period. Be sure to call your doctor immediately if you notice:
Signs of infection, such as fever and chills, redness, swelling, increased pain, excessive bleeding, or discharge from the incision sites. Difficulty urinating, nausea or vomiting, constipation, pain that isn't relieved by available medication, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain."
5908,How is a bone graft made?,"A bone graft can be taken from the patient's own healthy bone. This is called an autograft. Autograft bone often comes from your ribs, hips or a leg.
A bone graft can also be made from frozen, donated bone (allograft). Most allograft bone comes from donors who have died. Tissue banks screen these donors and disinfect and test the donated bone to make sure it is safe to use.
In some cases, a man-made (synthetic) bone substitute is used.
No matter where the bone graft comes from, the surgery will be the same. A surgeon makes a cut over the bone defect. The bone graft is shaped and inserted into and around the area. It is held in place with pins, plates, or screws. Stitches are used to close the wound.
A splint or cast is usually used to prevent injury or movement while healing."
5909,Why is a bone graft performed?,"Bone grafts are used to:
Fuse joints to prevent movement Repair bone loss from broken bones (fractures) or cancers Repair injured bone that has not healed"
5910,What to expect if I have Bone grafting  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,Outlook for a bone graft is very good. Most bone grafts help the bone defect to heal with little risk of graft rejection.
5911,Why and when should a breast examination be performed?,"The asymptomatic breast exam is generally performed only on women. This is because diseases of the breast, in particular cancer, occur far more commonly in women then men. Malignancies generally originate in either the glandular tissues that secrete milk or in the ductal structures that transport it to the nipple.
Examination can be done by the clinician (Clinical Breast Exam - CBE) or patient (Self Breast Exam - SBE). Those performed by the clinician are usually done on an annual basis, beginning at the age of 40, which coincides with time of increased risk for development of breast cancer. Other major breast cancer risk factors include: prior history of breast ca, family history in 1st degree relative (particularly if at a young age), increasing patient age and features that result in prolonged/uninterrupted exposure to estrogen (e.g. early age at onset menstruation, never having been pregnant, older age at first pregnancy, older age at menopause). SBE is often recommended on a monthly-to-every-few-months basis.
Interestingly, while both SBE and CBE are part of routine clinical care, there are no studies that demonstrate that either of these techniques, when performed as stand-alone examinations, actually improves clinical outcomes (i.e. detects cancer at an earlier stage, demonstrating positive impact on cancer related morbidity or mortality). In contrast, mammography (performed with or without CBE), has a strong body of evidence to support its routine use as a screening tool for early detection of malignancy.
The goal of the examination in the setting of symptoms is to better characterize the abnormality, identify underlying etiology, and direct additional evaluation and treatment. Breast related symptoms may include any of the following:
Discrete masses detected by the patient, often concerning for malignancy Pain, which can be associated with a number of processes including: cyclical in a menstruating women (reflecting transient hormone induced changes in the breast tissue), occasionally malignancies. Unusual nipple discharge, which may include:
Blood, concerning for malignancy Milk when not pregnant. Suggestive inappropriate Prolactin secretion from the pituitary - may also be induced by certain medications Other
Discoloration or change in the quality of the skin:
Redness suggests infection or inflammation - in the post partum patient, this is often due to mastitis, a diffuse inflammatory condition caused by congestion from inadequately expressed milk. ""Peau d'orange"" quality - an ""Orange Peel"" like texture that's caused by an uncommon, aggressive inflammatory malignancy
If a mass or other abnormality is identified, it's location can be described as being in one of 4 quadrants (left upper, left lower, right upper, right lower) of the breast. Alternatively, it can be described relative to it's position, imagining a clock face were superimposed on the breast.
It's worth noting that breast symptoms may be caused by diseases elsewhere in the body. For example, as mentioned above, inappropriate milk production may be due to a pituitary tumor secreting Prolactin. Or breast development in men may signify underlying liver disease. Given this, breast symptoms may merit careful history and evaluation of other organ systems. As symptoms can occur in male or female patients (though overall, female >>> male), evaluation is indicated in either sex patient who presents with breast concerns."
5912,How is Cholecystectomy done?,"Open gallbladder removal surgery
The surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your belly to open it up and see the area. The surgeon then removes your gallbladder by reaching in through the incision and gently lifting it out. Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia (unconscious and unable to feel pain). The surgeon will make a 5 to 7 inch incision in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs. The surgeon will cut the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder. Then your gallbladder will be removed. A special x-ray called a cholangiogram will be done during the surgery. This involves squirting some dye into your common bile duct. This duct will be left inside you after your gallbladder has been removed. The dye helps locate other stones that may be outside your gallbladder. If any are found, the surgeon may be able to remove these other stones with a special medical instrument. Open gallbladder removal surgery takes about an hour.
Laparoscopic gallbladder removal
It is the most common way to remove the gallbladder. A laparoscope is a thin, lighted tube that lets the doctor see inside your belly. Gallbladder removal surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia (unconscious and not able to feel pain). The surgeon will make 3 to 4 small cuts in your belly. The laparoscope will be inserted through 1 of the cuts. Other medical instruments will be inserted through the other cuts. Gas will be pumped into your belly to expand it. This gives the surgeon more space to work. First, the surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder. Then the surgeon removes the gallbladder, using the laparoscope. Sometimes the surgeon cannot safely take out the gallbladder using a laparoscope. In this case, the surgeon will instead do an open cholecystectomy."
5913,Who needs Cholecystectomy?,"Your doctor may recommend gallbladder removal surgery if you have gallstones or your gallbladder is not functioning normally (biliary dyskinesia). You may have some or all of these symptoms:
Pain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain) Nausea and vomiting Indigestion Infection"
5914,Where to find centers that perform Cholecystectomy?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Cholecystectomy
5915,What are the risks of Cholecystectomy?,"The risks for any anesthesia include:
Reactions to drugs you are given. Breathing problems. Pneumonia. Heart problems. Blood clots in the legs or lungs.
The risks for gallbladder surgery include:
Bleeding. Infection in your belly. Injury to the common bile duct. Injury to the small intestine. Pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas)."
5916,What to expect before the procedure?,"Your doctor may ask you to have these medical tests done before you have surgery:
Blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, and kidney tests). Chest x-ray or electrocardiogram (EKG), for some people. Several x-rays of the gallbladder.
Always tell your doctor or nurse:
If you are or might be pregnant. What drugs, vitamins, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription.
During the week before your surgery:
You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot. Your doctor may ask you to ""clean out"" your colon or intestines. Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.
On the day of your surgery:
Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. Shower the night before or the morning of your surgery. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.
Prepare your home for after the surgery."
5917,What to expect after the procedure?,"If you do not have any signs of problems, you will be able to go home when you are able to drink liquids easily. Most people go home on the same day or the day after this surgery. If there were problems during your surgery, or if you have bleeding, a lot of pain, or a fever, you may need to stay in the hospital longer. Some people may experience mild diarrhea after the procedure,this usually goes away with time."
5918,How is the Episiotomy done?,"Just before the baby is born, the obstetrician numbs the vaginal area opening and makes one of two cuts:
A mediolateral cut is angled down away from the vagina and into the muscle. A midline cut is made straight down between the vagina and anus. The cut makes the opening to the vagina bigger. The cut is stitched closed after the baby and placenta have been delivered."
5919,Who needs Episiotomy?,"Episiotomies were once routinely performed to prevent vaginal tears during delivery. Today, routine episiotomies are not recommended.
However, episiotomies may still be performed when there is a complicated delivery. An episiotomy may be needed if the baby's head or shoulders are too big for the mother's vaginal opening, or the baby is in a breech position (feet or buttocks coming first) and there is a problem during delivery.
It may also be needed to speed the delivery process if there is concern about the baby's heart rate."
5920,Where to find centers that perform Episiotomy?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Episiotomy
5921,What to expect if I have Episiotomy  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"An episiotomy usually heals without problems and may be easier to repair than multiple tears.
You can resume normal activities shortly after the birth. The stitches are absorbed by the body and do not need to be removed. You can relieve pain and discomfort with medication and ice in the first 24 hours, followed by warm baths."
5922,How is Nissen fundoplication done?,"A procedure called fundoplication is the most common type of anti-reflux surgery. During this procedure, your surgeon will:
First repair the hiatal hernia with stitches. The surgeon will tighten the opening in your diaphragm to keep your stomach from bulging through.
Your surgeon will then use stitches to wrap the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus. This creates pressure at the end of your esophagus and helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up. Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). Surgery usually takes 2 to 3 hours.
Ways your doctor may do this surgery are:
Open repair. Your surgeon will make an incision (cut) in your belly area (abdomen). Sometimes the surgeon will place a tube from your stomach through the abdominal wall to keep your stomach in place. This tube will be removed when you no longer need it. Laparoscopic repair: Your surgeon will make 3 to 5 small incisions in your belly. Your surgeon will insert a laparoscope (a thin, hollow tube with a tiny camera on the end) through one of these incisions and other tools through the other incisions. The laparoscope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room that allows your surgeon to see inside your belly and do the repair. The surgeon may need to switch to an open procedure if there is bleeding, a lot of scar tissue from earlier surgeries, or the patient is very overweight.
Endoluminal fundoplication is a new procedure that uses a special camera called an endoscope. The tube is passed down through your mouth and into your esophagus. Your doctor will place small clips on the inside where the esophagus meets the stomach. These clips help prevent food or stomach acid from coming back. An endoscope is similar to a laparoscope. This procedure is done to help prevent reflux."
5923,Who needs Nissen fundoplication?,"Your doctor may suggest surgery when:
You have symptoms of heartburn that get better when you use medicines, but you do not want to continue taking these medicines. Symptoms of heartburn are burning in the stomach that you may also feel in your throat or chest, burping or gas bubbles, or have trouble swallowing food or fluids. Part of your stomach is getting stuck in your chest or is twisting around itself. This is called a para-esophageal hernia. You have reflux disease and another related, serious problem. Some of these problems are strictures (a narrowing of your esophagus), ulcers in your esophagus, and bleeding in your esophagus. You have reflux disease and aspiration pneumonia (a lung infection caused by inhaling contents of the stomach into the lungs), a chronic cough, or hoarseness."
5924,Where to find centers that perform Nissen fundoplication?,Directions to Hospitals Performing Nissen fundoplication
5925,What are the risks of Nissen fundoplication?,"Risks for any anesthesia are:
Reactions to medicines. Breathing problems, including pneumonia. Heart problems.
Risks for any surgery are:
Bleeding. Infection.
Risks for this surgery are:
Gas bloat, which makes it hard to burp or throw up. It also causes bloating after meals. These symptoms slowly get better for most people. Pain and difficulty when you swallow, for some people. This is called dysphagia. For most people, this goes away in the first 3 months after surgery. Damage to the stomach, esophagus, liver, or small intestine. This is very rare. Respiratory complications, such as a collapsed lung. This is also rare. Recurrence of the hiatal hernia."
5926,What to expect before the procedure?,"Your doctor may ask you to have these tests:
Blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, or liver tests). Upper endoscopy. Almost all people who have this procedure have already had this test. If you have not, you will need to. Other tests, such as manometry (to measure gases) or pH monitoring (to see how much stomach acid is in your esophagus).
Always tell your doctor or nurse if:
You could be pregnant. You are taking any drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.
During the week before your surgery:
You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs or supplements that affect blood clotting several days to a week before surgery. Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.
On the day of your surgery:
Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. Take your drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. Shower the night before or the morning of your surgery. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital."
5927,What to expect after the procedure?,"Patients who have laparoscopic surgery usually spend 1 to 3 days in hospital. Those who have open surgery may spend 2 to 6 days in the hospital after the procedure.
Most patients go back to work 2 to 3 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 4 to 6 weeks after open surgery."
5928,Are there any diet restrictions before the procedure?,You should not eat or drink after midnight the night before the procedure.
5929,Should I take my daily medications before the procedure?,"If you usually take a medication in the morning, you may take this medication with a few amount of water (not a full glass).

Has any research been done to characterize which treatment types are effective against which migraine types?","There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.   A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.  If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:  - Antidepressants  - Blood pressure medicines  - Seizure medicines    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.  Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium are right for you.  TREATING AN ATTACK  Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:   - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.  - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.  - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.    If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.   Feverfew is a herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people.

5950,When and how do you know when you have congenital night blindness?,"X-linked congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness). They also have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder. The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Researchers have identified two major types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: the complete form and the incomplete form. The types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause and by the results of a test called an electroretinogram, which measures the function of the retina.

5951,"Would appreciate any good info on Lewy Body Dementia, we need to get people aware of this dreadful disease, all they talk about is alzheimers.  Thank you ","Summary       Lewy body disease is one of the most common causes of dementia in the elderly. Dementia is the loss of mental functions severe enough to affect normal activities and relationships. Lewy body disease happens when abnormal structures, called Lewy bodies, build up in areas of the brain. The disease may cause a wide range of symptoms, including       - Changes in alertness and attention    - Hallucinations    - Problems with movement and posture    - Muscle stiffness    - Confusion    - Loss of memory       Lewy body disease can be hard to diagnose, because Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together.    Lewy body disease usually begins between the ages of 50 and 85. The disease gets worse over time. There is no cure. Treatment focuses on drugs to help symptoms.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"
5952,Gene changes or chromosomal changes of MSUD? What is the technical and simple language of MSUD? Are there any treatments for MSUD?,"Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. These three genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together as a complex. The protein complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs.    Mutations in any of these three genes reduce or eliminate the function of the protein complex, preventing the normal breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, their accumulation leads to the serious health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease."

5955,"What can I give my [AGE] father to help him sleep? He said he will take whatever. He is not on any medication, not allergic to anything.  Fully ambilatory!","Lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. These changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.                  A type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. Anxiety tends to prolong insomnia.                  Several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. However, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible).                  Lifestyle Changes                  If you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as:                  Caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. The effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours.                  Certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). Talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep.                  Alcohol. An alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. However, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. This makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night.                  Try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. For example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath.                  Try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. Don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime.                  Make your bedroom sleep-friendly. Avoid bright lighting while winding down. Try to limit possible distractions, such as a TV, computer, or pet. Make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. Your bedroom also should be dark and quiet.                  Go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. If you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule.                  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy                  CBT for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. This therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety.                  For example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. These strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood.                  CBT also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. This method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time.                  CBT also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. This method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. The goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing.                  CBT also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. This method involves setting a sleep schedule. At first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep.                  This schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. However, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. Over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep.                  For success with CBT, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. CBT works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. It also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone.                  For people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, CBT combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions.                  Medicines                  Prescription Medicines                  Many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. Some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use.                  Talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. For example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them.                  Rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. If you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn't work well, tell your doctor. He or she might prescribe a different medicine.                  Some insomnia medicines can be habit forming. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines.                  Over-the-Counter Products                  Some over-the-counter (OTC) products claim to treat insomnia. These products include melatonin, L-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts.                  The Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate “natural” products and some food supplements. Thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. How well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood.                  Some OTC products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. Although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them.                  Antihistamines pose risks for some people. Also, these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia. Your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you."

Thank you so much.","A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of tumor that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. The tumors are thought to grow from specialized cells found in the gastrointestinal tract called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or precursors to these cells. GISTs are usually found in adults between ages 40 and 70; rarely, children and young adults develop these tumors. The tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).  Small tumors may cause no signs or symptoms. However, some people with GISTs may experience pain or swelling in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or weight loss. Sometimes, tumors cause bleeding, which may lead to low red blood cell counts (anemia) and, consequently, weakness and tiredness. Bleeding into the intestinal tract may cause black and tarry stools, and bleeding into the throat or stomach may cause vomiting of blood.  Affected individuals with no family history of GIST typically have only one tumor (called a sporadic GIST). People with a family history of GISTs (called familial GISTs) often have multiple tumors and additional signs or symptoms, including noncancerous overgrowth (hyperplasia) of other cells in the gastrointestinal tract and patches of dark skin on various areas of the body. Some affected individuals have a skin condition called urticaria pigmentosa (also known as cutaneous mastocytosis), which is characterized by raised patches of brownish skin that sting or itch when touched."

People with this condition initially experience problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). Other early signs and symptoms of SCA3 include speech difficulties, uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), muscle stiffness (spasticity), rigidity, tremors, bulging eyes, and double vision. People with this condition may experience sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome or REM sleep behavior disorder. Restless leg syndrome is a condition characterized by numbness or tingling in the legs accompanied by an urge to move the legs to stop the sensations. REM sleep behavior disorder is a condition in which the muscles are active during the dream (REM) stage of sleep, so an affected person often acts out his or her dreams. These sleep disorders tend to leave affected individuals feeling tired during the day.  Over time, individuals with SCA3 may develop loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), muscle cramps, muscle twitches (fasciculations), and swallowing difficulties. Individuals with SCA3 may have problems with memory, planning, and problem solving.  Signs and symptoms of the disorder typically begin in mid-adulthood but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood. People with SCA3 eventually require wheelchair assistance. They usually survive 10 to 20 years after symptoms first appear."

5965,i have a problem of ingrown toenail its about 4 years now I have this problem i need help,"If you have diabetes, nerve damage in the leg or foot, poor blood circulation to your foot, or an infection around the nail, go to the doctor right away. Do not try to treat an ingrown nail at home.  Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home:  - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry.  - Gently massage over the inflamed skin.  - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton with water or antiseptic.   When trimming your toenails:  - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nail.  - Use a clean, sharp trimmer.  - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short. Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse.   Consider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem.  If this does not work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist) or a skin specialist (dermatologist).  If your ingrown nail does not heal or keeps coming back, your doctor may remove part of the nail:  - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe.  - The doctor uses scissors to cut along the edge of the nail where the skin is growing over. This portion of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion.  - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow.   Sometimes your doctor will use a chemical, electrical current, or another small surgical cut to destroy or remove the area from which a new nail may grow.  If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics."

5967,"article defining 'conversion disorder' In your article defining 'conversion disorder', [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000954.htm] , the quote ""Conversion disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has blindness paralysis, or other nervous system (neurologic) symptoms that cannot be explained be medical evaluation"" , seemed to imply that the physical symptoms were valid as proving to be valid, but however the doctor could not 'figure' out why,.....but when I went to another source, another article quotes the disorder as a ""physical disability that is not caused by any physical impairment"" -so I am defining this as symptoms that are visibly correct as analyzed visually but when under examination for deadened nerves or broken bones, no evidence is found? >that is the definition I am getting from the other source about this disorder.

5969,I have been battling Anal fissure for close to two years now and it has refused to heal all these while. Please what do you suggest i do?  Thanks,"Most fissures heal on their own and do not need treatment.  To prevent or treat anal fissures in infants, be sure to change diapers often and clean the area gently.  CHILDREN AND ADULTS  Worrying about pain during a bowel movement may cause a person to avoid them. But not having bowel movements will only cause the stools to become even harder, which can make anal fissure worse.  Prevent hard stools and constipation by:  - Making dietary changes -- eating more fiber or bulk, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains  - Drinking more fluids  - Using stool softeners    Applying the following ointments or creams to the area may soothe the skin:  - Numbing cream, if pain interferes with normal bowel movements  - Petroleum jelly  - Zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, Preparation H, and other products    A sitz bath is a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing. You should sit in the bath two to three times a day. The water should cover only your hips and buttocks.  If the anal fissures do not go away with home care methods, treatment may involve:  - Botox injections into the muscle in the anus (anal sphincter)  - Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle  - Prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers, applied over the fissure to help relax the muscles"

5977,My cousin she is leber amaurosis she need help I don't know where to start from,"Leber congenital amaurosis is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time.  Leber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all. Additionally, the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin, a condition known as keratoconus.  A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children.  In rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. However, researchers are uncertain whether these individuals actually have Leber congenital amaurosis or another syndrome with similar signs and symptoms.  At least 13 types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities."

Do NOT use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. Warts in these areas need to be treated by a health care provider.

You can buy these at drugstores without a prescription. Use socks. Wear shoes with plenty of room. Avoid high heels.  Your health care provider may need to trim away thick skin or calluses that form over warts on your foot or around nails.   Your provider may recommend the following treatments if your warts do not go away:  - Stronger (prescription) medicines  - A blistering solution   - Freezing the wart (cryotherapy) to remove it  - Burning the wart (electrocautery) to remove it  - Laser treatment for difficult to remove warts  - Immunotherapy, which gives you a shot of a substance that causes an allergic reaction and helps the wart go away  - Skin medicine called imiquimod    Genital warts are treated in a different way than most other warts.

This is done by a procedure called chelation -- certain medications can bind to copper and help remove it through the kidneys or gut. Treatment must be lifelong.  The following medications may be used:  - Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) binds to copper and leads to increased release of copper in the urine.  - Trientine (Syprine) binds (chelates) the copper and increases its release through the urine.  - Zinc acetate (Galzin) blocks copper from being absorbed in the intestinal tract.    Vitamin E supplements may also be used.  Sometimes, medications that chelate copper (especially penicillamine) can affect the function of the brain and nervous system (neurological function). Other medications under investigation may bind copper without affecting neurological function.  A low-copper diet may also be recommended. Foods to avoid include:  - Chocolate  - Dried fruit  - Liver  - Mushrooms  - Nuts  - Shellfish    You may want to drink distilled water because most tap water flows through copper pipes.

On the right eye a white growth has now covered almost the whole retina. The specialists say that this growth is a result of eye surgeries she got years back and now there is no solution for this. Now she can hardly see the shadow things lying very close to her. I would be grateful if you kindly guide me if there is any solution for this.  Thanks","If you have low vision, eyeglasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery may not help. Activities like reading, shopping, cooking, writing, and watching TV may be hard to do. The leading causes of low vision and blindness in the United States are age-related eye diseases: macular degeneration, cataract and glaucoma. Other eye disorders, eye injuries, and birth defects can also cause vision loss. Whatever the cause, lost vision cannot be restored. It can, however, be managed. A loss of vision means that you may have to reorganize your life and learn new ways of doing things. If you have some vision, visual aids such as special glasses and large print books can make life easier. There are also devices to help those with no vision, like text-reading software and braille books. The sooner vision loss or eye disease is found and treated, the greater your chances of keeping your remaining vision. You should have regular comprehensive eye exams by an eye care professional."

But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months.   If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow.  Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis.   You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly.  Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible:  - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs.  - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together.  - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still.   Scoliosis treatment may also include:  - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace.  - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly."

In the last 7 years I rarely eat meat and when I do it's chicken or fish maybe beef every 5 years or so and its maybe a hamburger lean. If you do have arteriosclerosis is there anyway to reverse it?,"A substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells.   A heart attack may occur when:  - A tear in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood a clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack.  - A slow buildup of plaque may narrow one of the coronary arteries so that it is almost blocked.    In either case, there is not enough blood flow to the heart muscle and heart muscle dies.  The cause of heart attack is not always known.    Heart attack may occur:   - When you are resting or asleep  - After a sudden increase in physical activity  - When you are active outside in cold weather  - After sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness    Many risk factors may lead to the development of plaque buildup and a heart attack."
6007,Can a long term untreated bladder infection aid in the cause of cervical cancer? And can the fact that my mom has cervical cancer aid in my chance of getting cervical cancer?,"Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.  A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:   - Having sex at an early age  - Having multiple sexual partners  - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities    Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:  - Not getting the HPV vaccine  - Being economically disadvantaged  - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage  - Having a weakened immune system"
6008,My father is suffering from IBS and is loosing weight day by day.sometimes he even faints due to weakness.He cannot digest food .please help us and suggest us upon this problem.,"The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms.   In some cases of IBS, lifestyle changes can help. For example, regular exercise and improved sleep habits may reduce anxiety and help relieve bowel symptoms.  Dietary changes can be helpful. However, no specific diet can be recommended for IBS because the condition differs from one person to another.  The following changes may help:  - Avoiding foods and drinks that stimulate the intestines (such as caffeine, tea, or colas)  - Eating smaller meals  - Increasing fiber in the diet (this may improve constipation or diarrhea, but make bloating worse)    Talk with your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines.  No one medicine works for everyone. Some that your provider may suggest include:  - Anticholinergic medicines (dicyclomine, propantheline, belladonna, and hyoscyamine) taken about a half-hour before eating to control intestinal muscle spasms  - Bisacodyl to treat constipation  - Loperamide to treat diarrhea  - Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants to help relieve intestinal pain  - Lubiprostone for constipation symptoms  - Rifaximin, an antibiotic    Psychological therapy or medicines for anxiety or depression may help with the problem."

The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes (mutations) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors)."

Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight-loss surgery.  There is no cure for type 1 diabetes.   Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level.  Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator.   Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.  To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider's instructions on managing your diabetes."
6014,"Angelman syndrome. Can a person with Angelman Syndrome have children? If so, can the disorder be passed on to offspring? ","Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. In these instances, people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next."
6015,What happen to diabetes  patient Getting  blood sugar increase by which of body in brain or stomach or urine bladder.why urine bladder become more weight that any other part of body.,"Summary       Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.    Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.    Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

Trimethylamine has been described as smelling like rotting fish, rotting eggs, garbage, or urine. As this compound builds up in the body, it causes affected people to give off a strong odor in their sweat, urine, and breath. The intensity of the odor may vary over time. The odor can interfere with many aspects of daily life, affecting a person's relationships, social life, and career. Some people with trimethylaminuria experience depression and social isolation as a result of this condition."

I am unable to walk due to a  arthritic knee. otherwise I am flexable..  my home address is [CONTACT], My email is [CONTACT] (mailto:[CONTACT]) Thank you, [NAME] ","A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home."
6019,I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.,"The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection.  Three treatment options are available:  - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments.  - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments.  - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis.    TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL)  Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include:  - Cortisone creams and ointments  - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin  - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid)  - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription)  - Moisturizers  - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids)    SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS  If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used.  Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include:  - Adalimumab (Humira)  - Etanercept (Enbrel)  - Infliximab (Remicade)  - Ustekinumab (Stelara)  - Secukinumab (Cosentyx)  - Apremilast (Otezla)    PHOTOTHERAPY  Some people may choose to have phototherapy:  - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light.  - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light.  - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.   OTHER TREATMENTS  If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics.  HOME CARE  Following these tips at home may help:   - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack.  - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup of oatmeal into a tub of warm water.  - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups.  - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned.  - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood.  - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse."

I would like to know is it possible that other children (like me) could have the syndrome symptoms to a lesser or greater degree:i.e., is there a continuum???","Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the ATM gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  About 1 percent of the United States population carries one mutated copy and one normal copy of the ATM gene in each cell. These individuals are called carriers. Although ATM mutation carriers do not have ataxia-telangiectasia, they are more likely than people without an ATM mutation to develop cancer; female carriers are particularly at risk for developing breast cancer. Carriers of a mutation in the ATM gene also may have an increased risk of heart disease."

According to my mentioned story, can you help me to find the real cause of my insomnia?   Thank you, Your answer is very appreciable and important to me.   [NAME].","Secondary Insomnia                  Secondary insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem. This type of insomnia often is a symptom of an emotional, neurological, or other medical or sleep disorder.                  Emotional disorders that can cause insomnia include depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are examples of neurological disorders that can cause insomnia.                  Many other disorders or factors also can cause insomnia, such as:                  Conditions that cause chronic (ongoing) pain, such as arthritis and headache disorders                  Conditions that make it hard to breathe, such as asthma and heart failure                  An overactive thyroid                  Gastrointestinal disorders, such as heartburn                  Stroke                  Sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep-related breathing problems                  Menopause and hot flashes                  Secondary insomnia also can be a side effect of some medicines. For example, certain asthma medicines, such as theophylline, and some allergy and cold medicines can cause insomnia. Beta blockers also can cause the condition. These medicines are used to treat heart conditions.                  Commonly used substances also can cause insomnia. Examples include caffeine and other stimulants, tobacco and other nicotine products, and alcohol and other sedatives.                  Primary Insomnia                  Primary insomnia isn't a symptom or side effect of another medical condition. It is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isn’t well understood. Primary insomnia usually lasts for at least 1 month.                  Many life changes can trigger primary insomnia. It may be due to major or long-lasting stress or emotional upset. Travel or other factors, such as work schedules that disrupt your sleep routine, also may trigger primary insomnia.                  Even if these issues are resolved, the insomnia may not go away. Trouble sleeping can persist because of habits formed to deal with the lack of sleep. These habits might include taking naps, worrying about sleep, and going to bed early.                  Researchers continue to try to find out whether some people are born with an increased risk for primary insomnia."

6027,"Colon cancer cure seen on tv.  My father has colon cancer and said he saw a commercial on tv about a cure for colon cancer.  He cannot remember any details about it. I was wondering if you know anything about something like this.  Please let me know.  Thank you, [NAME] ","Treatment depends on many things, including the stage of the cancer. Treatments may include:  - Surgery to remove the tumor  - Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells  - Radiation therapy to destroy cancerous tissue  - Targeted therapy to keep cancer from growing and spreading    Surgery  Stage 0 colon cancer may be treated by removing the tumor. This is done using colonoscopy. For stages I, II, and III cancer, more extensive surgery is needed to remove the part of the colon that is cancerous. This surgery is called colon resection (colectomy).  Chemotherapy  Almost all people with stage III colon cancer receive chemotherapy after surgery for 6 to 8 months. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Even though the tumor was removed, chemotherapy is given to treat any cancer cells that may be left.  Chemotherapy is also used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in people with stage IV colon cancer.  You may receive just one type of medicine or a combination of medicines.   Radiation  Radiation therapy is sometimes used for colon cancer. It is usually used in combination with chemotherapy for people with stage III rectal cancer.  For people with stage IV disease that has spread to the liver, treatment directed at the liver can be used. This may include:  - Burning the cancer (ablation)  - Delivering chemotherapy or radiation directly into the liver  - Freezing the cancer (cryotherapy)  - Surgery   Targeted Therapy  - Targeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Targeted therapy may be given as pills or may be injected into a vein.  - You may have targeted therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment.  "
6028,Is there any way you could send me information on both these heart conditions? My son has to get tested for them eventually and I would just like information to understand the conditions of both of them more.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Often, only 1 part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. The thickening can make it harder for blood to leave the heart, forcing the heart to work harder to pump blood. It also can make it harder for the heart to relax and fill with blood."
6029,I'm a vietnam navy veteran whose traditional stroke thearapy has failed miserably,"A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home."
6030,Haglund's deformity of the calcaneum.  I have this problem.  Can you please help to overcome this?,"Your provider may recommend that you do the following:      Avoid activities that cause pain.     Put ice on the heel several times a day.     Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.     Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.     Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.   Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.  If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).  If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa."
6031,williams sydrome conditon.  i need to send me more information about Williams Syndrome and some tips how to educate people with this disorder.I hope having news from you soon!!thank you,"Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.  People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder.  Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.  Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected people may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. Medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible."

I am dying with pains.,"Most women have some adenomyosis as they get close to menopause. However, only a few will have symptoms. Most women do not need treatment.  Birth control pills and a progesterone-containing intrauterine device (IUD) can help decrease heavy bleeding. Anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage symptoms.  A hysterectomy may be necessary in women with severe symptoms."
6033,My brother need treatment for muscular dystrophy,"There are no known cures for the various muscular dystrophies. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms.  Physical therapy may help maintain muscle strength and function. Leg braces and a wheelchair can improve mobility and self-care. In some cases, surgery on the spine or legs may help improve function.  Corticosteroids taken by mouth are sometimes prescribed to children with certain muscular dystrophies to keep them walking for as long as possible.  The person should be as active as possible. No activity at all (such as bedrest) can make the disease worse."
6034,What ia the lowest starting dose of Citalopram?,"Initial Treatment  Celexa (citalopram HBr) should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended.  Celexa should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Special Populations  20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mg/day only for nonresponding patients.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Celexa should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester  Neonates exposed to Celexa and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS). When treating pregnant women with Celexa during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering Celexa in the third trimester. Maintenance Treatment  It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of Celexa in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of Celexa (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of Celexa 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered. Discontinuation of Treatment with Celexa  Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Celexa and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor  At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of Celexa therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Celexa before starting an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS)."

The diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed below. When the person with suspected ADHD is a child, parents and teachers are usually involved during the evaluation process.  Most children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health problem. This problem may be a mood, anxiety or substance use disorder; a learning disability; or a tic disorder. A doctor can help determine whether these other conditions are present. Symptoms  ADHD symptoms fall into three groups:    Not being able to focus (inattentiveness)  Being extremely active (hyperactivity)  Not being able to control behavior (impulsivity)  Some people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. Others have a combination of these behaviors.    INATTENTIVE SYMPTOMS    Doesn't pay attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork  Has problems focusing during tasks or play  Doesn't listen when spoken to directly  Doesn't follow through on instructions and doesn't finish schoolwork or chores  Has problems organizing tasks and activities  Avoids or doesn't like tasks that require mental effort (such as schoolwork)  Often loses things, such as homework or toys  Is easily distracted  Is often forgetful  HYPERACTIVITY SYMPTOMS    Fidgets or squirms in seat  Leaves their seat when they should stay in their seat  Runs about or climbs when they shouldn't be doing so  Has problems playing or working quietly  Is often ""on the go,"" acts as if ""driven by a motor""  Talks all the time  IMPULSIVITY SYMPTOMS    Blurts out answers before questions have been completed  Has problems awaiting their turn  Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games)  Many of the above findings are present in children as they grow.

And creating the medication,"Risperidone is used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions) in adults and teenagers 13 years of age and older. It is also used to treat episodes of mania (frenzied, abnormally excited, or irritated mood) or mixed episodes (symptoms of mania and depression that happen together) in adults and in teenagers and children 10 years of age and older with bipolar disorder (manic depressive disorder; a disease that causes episodes of depression, episodes of mania, and other abnormal moods). Risperidone is also used to treat behavior problems such as aggression, self-injury, and sudden mood changes in teenagers and children 5 to 16 years of age who have autism (a condition that causes repetitive behavior, difficulty interacting with others, and problems with communication). Risperidone is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain."
6039,Is optic atrophy ginetic and what cause it?,"There are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma.  Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include:   - Brain tumor  - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis)  - Multiple sclerosis  - Stroke   There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults."
6040,What is the connection (if any) between Essential Tremor and Parkinsons and what is the best treatment for Essential Tremor?,"Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder.  It is characterized by involuntary and rhythmic shaking (tremor), especially in the hands, without any other signs or symptoms. It is distinguished from tremor that results from other disorders or known causes, such as tremors seen with Parkinson disease or head trauma. Most cases of essential tremor are hereditary. There are five forms of essential tremor that are based on different genetic causes. Several genes as well as lifestyle and environmental factors likely play a role in a person's risk of developing this complex condition. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. In cases where symptoms interfere with daily living, medications may help to relieve symptoms."

If you think you have dry mouth, see your dentist or physician. He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do's and Don'ts Do's - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often.

Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions.

This can damage your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.     Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American women. The cause of lupus is not known.     Lupus has many symptoms.

Can you tell if you have leukemia?8. What treatments do you need to take?9. What are the signs of leukemia?10. What is the difference between AML and CML ?,"Some cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are linked to cancer treatment, but in most cases the cause is unknown.  Over the past few years, scientists have made progress in understanding how certain changes in the DNA of bone marrow cells may cause CMML to develop. DNA is the chemical that carries the instructions for nearly everything our cells do. We usually look like our parents because they are the source of our DNA. However, DNA affects more than the way we look.  Some genes (parts of DNA) control a cell’s growth and division process. Genes that promote cell division are called oncogenes. Other genes called tumor suppressor genes can slow down cell division or even make cells die at an appropriate time. Cancers can be caused by DNA mutations (gene defects) that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes.  In some diseases, mutations may be passed down from a parent. Inherited mutations do not seem to cause CMML. Instead, the mutations are acquired during the person’s lifetime. Exposure to radiation or cancer-causing chemicals can cause mutations that lead to CMML. Sometimes these gene changes occur for no apparent reason. Every time a cell prepares to divide into 2 new cells, it must copy its DNA. This process is not perfect, and copying errors can occur. Fortunately, cells have repair enzymes that read and fix DNA. However, some errors may slip past, especially if the cells are growing rapidly.  Human DNA is packaged in 23 pairs of chromosomes. In up to half of patients, CMML cells contain altered chromosomes. Sometimes part of one chromosome attaches to a different chromosome. This is called a translocation. Like mutations, translocations can turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes. Acquired translocations are seen in some cases of CMML. Another chromosome abnormality that can be seen in CMML is called a deletion. This involves the loss of all or part of a chromosome. Another type of chromosome abnormality is called a duplication. This is when there is an extra copy of all or part of a chromosome. "

","A number of different antibiotics may be used for treating this type of infection.  - You may receive one large dose of oral antibiotics or take a smaller dose for seven days.  - You may be given an antibiotic injection or shot, and then perhaps be sent home with antibiotic pills.  - More severe cases of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) may require you to stay in the hospital. Antibiotics are first given by IV.  - Never treat yourself without being seen by your doctor first. Your health care provider will determine the best treatment.    About half of the women with gonorrhea are also infected with chlamydia. Chlamydia is treated at the same time as a gonorrhea infection.  You will need a follow-up visit 7 days after if your symptoms include joint pain, skin rash, or more severe pelvic or belly pain. Tests will be done to make sure the infection is gone.  Sexual partners must be tested and treated to prevent passing the infection back and forth. You and your partner must finish all of the antibiotics. Use condoms until you both have finished taking your antibiotics.  All sexual contacts of the person with gonorrhea should be contacted and tested.

6047,is this a safe decision,"Treatment depends on many things, including your Gleason score and your overall health. Your doctor will discuss your treatment options with you.  If the cancer has not spread outside the prostate gland, common treatments include:   - Surgery (radical prostatectomy)  - Radiation therapy, including brachytherapy and proton therapy   If you are older, your doctor may recommend simply monitoring the cancer with PSA tests and biopsies.  Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. It helps relieve symptoms and prevents further growth and spread of the cancer. But it does not cure the cancer.  If prostate cancer spreads even after hormone therapy, surgery, or radiation has been tried, treatment may include:  - Chemotherapy  - Immunotherapy (medicine to trigger the immune system to attack and kill cancer cells)    Surgery, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy can affect your sexual performance. Problems with urine control are possible after surgery and radiation therapy. Discuss your concerns with your health care provider.  After treatment for prostate cancer, you will be closely watched to make sure the cancer does not spread.

I need my hair back as im the spitting double of Dr evil with no hair.,"If hair loss is not widespread, the hair will often regrow in a few months without treatment.  For more severe hair loss, it is not clear how much treatment can help change the course of the condition.  Common treatments may include:  - Steroid injection under the skin surface  - Medicines applied to the skin  - Ultraviolet light therapy    Wigs may be used to hide areas of hair loss."
6049,I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help,"CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE   An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch"

This is followed by physical therapy. Most people who follow these treatments recover and return to normal activities. Some people will need to have more treatment. This may include steroid injections or surgery.  MEDICINES  Medicines can help with your pain. Your doctor may prescribe any of the following:  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term pain control  - Narcotics if the pain is severe and does not respond to NSAIDs  - Medicines to calm the nerves  - Muscle relaxants to relieve back spasms    LIFESTYLE CHANGES  If you are overweight, diet and exercise are very important for improving back pain.  Physical therapy is important for nearly everyone with disk disease. Therapists will teach you how to properly lift, dress, walk, and perform other activities. They teach you how to strengthen muscles that help support the spine. You will also learn how to increase flexibility in your spine and legs.  Take care of your back at home:   - Reduce activity for the first few days. Slowly restart your usual activities.  - Avoid heavy lifting or twisting your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain starts.  - After 2 to 3 weeks, gradually start exercising again.    INJECTIONS  Steroid medicine injections into the back in the area of the herniated disk may help control pain for several months. These injections reduce swelling around the disk and relieve many symptoms. Spinal injections are usually done in your doctor's office.   SURGERY  Surgery may be an option if your symptoms do not go away with other treatments and time.  Diskectomy is surgery to remove all or part of a disk.  Discuss with your doctor which treatment options are best for you."

6056,I have been treated for breast cancer and had chemotherapy and readiation.  I am on many drugs but since stopping treatment I have now presented as having asthma.  I take Letrozole. 2.5 to block any estrogen in my body as my tumor was estrogen positive. What type of drugs impact asthma symptoms?   Please advise,"Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.  In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers.   Common asthma triggers include:  - Animals (pet hair or dander)  - Dust mites  - Certain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDS)  - Changes in weather (most often cold weather)  - Chemicals in the air or in food  - Exercise  - Mold  - Pollen  - Respiratory infections, such as the common cold  - Strong emotions (stress)  - Tobacco smoke   Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.  Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies."
6057,"Customer Service Request.  My daughter has Turner syndrome but she's beaten all odds. She developed on our own, got her period on her own, she is now pregnant on her own with identical twins. My question is can she have normal children or do they have more of a chance of having Turner syndrome.  My daughter has been tested many times to confirm her diagnosis of Turner syndrome and she is a full XO not mosaic but still does not display many of the characteristics. Again, I am just questioning the safety of the pregnancy and the health of the babies. Thank you for your help ","Most cases of Turner syndrome are not inherited. Most commonly, Turner syndrome occurs due to a random event during the formation of an egg or sperm cell in a parent (prior to conception). For example, if an egg or sperm cell mistakenly loses a sex chromosome, and joins at conception with an egg or sperm containing an X chromosome, the resulting child will have a single X chromosome in each cell. Mosaic Turner syndrome, occurring when a person has some cells with one X chromosome and some cells with two sex chromosomes, is also not inherited. This also occurs due to a random event, during early fetal development rather than before conception. In rare cases, Turner syndrome may be caused by a missing piece (partial deletion) of the X chromosome. A deletion can be inherited from a parent. Genetic testing of an affected fetus or child can identify the type of Turner syndrome present and may help to estimate the risk of recurrence. People with questions about genetic testing or recurrence risks for Turner syndrome are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional."

If you think you have dry mouth, see your dentist or physician. He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do's and Don'ts Do's - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often.

Don't use tobacco or alcohol. They dry out the mouth. Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently."

This treatment is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).  In the past, people with HIV infection would start antiretroviral treatment after their CD4 count dropped or they developed HIV complications. Today, HIV treatment is recommended for all people with HIV infection, even if their CD4 count is still normal.  Regular blood tests are needed to make sure the virus level in the blood (viral load) is kept low, or suppressed. The goal of treatment is to lower the HIV virus in the blood to a level that is so low that the test can't detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load.  If the CD4 count already dropped before treatment was started, it will usually slowly go up. HIV complications often disappear as the immune system recovers."

6070,"Hello Dr.,In a case of patient with Kidney Stone size of 1.2mm x 2.3mm. What can i do? Pls i need your advice.","Treatment depends on the type of stone and the severity of your symptoms.  Kidney stones that are small most often pass through your system on their own.   - Your urine should be strained so the stone can be saved and tested.  - Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine. This will help the stone pass.  - Pain can be very bad. Over-the-counter pain medicines (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen), either alone or along with narcotics, can be very effective.    Some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital. You may need to get fluids through a vein.  For some types of stones, your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help break down and remove the material that is causing the stone. These medicines can include:  - Allopurinol (for uric acid stones)  - Antibiotics (for struvite stones)  - Diuretics  - Phosphate solutions  - Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate  - Water pills (thiazide diuretics)  - Tamsulosin to relax the ureter and help the stone pass    Surgery is often needed if:  - The stone is too large to pass on its own  - The stone is growing  - The stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage  - The pain cannot be controlled     Today, most treatments are much less invasive than in the past.  - Lithotripsy is used to remove stones slightly smaller than a half an inch that are located in the kidney or ureter. It uses sound or shock waves to break up stones. Then, the stone fragments leave the body in the urine. It is also called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or ESWL.  - Procedures performed by passing a special instrument through a small surgical cut in your skin and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones, or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed. The stone is removed with a tube (endoscope).  - Ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract.  - Rarely, open surgery (nephrolithotomy) may be needed if other methods do not work or are not possible.    Talk to your provider about what treatment options may work for you."

6074,"Where could I find more information about the rare disease, Ochoa syndrome. I think a sibling of mine might have it.","Ochoa syndrome is a disorder characterized by urinary problems and unusual facial expressions.  The urinary problems associated with Ochoa syndrome typically become apparent in early childhood or adolescence. People with this disorder may have difficulty controlling the flow of urine (incontinence), which can lead to bedwetting. Individuals with Ochoa syndrome may be unable to completely empty the bladder, often resulting in vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine backs up into the ducts that normally carry it from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters). Urine may also accumulate in the kidneys (hydronephrosis). Vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis can lead to frequent infections of the urinary tract and kidney inflammation (pyelonephritis), causing damage that may eventually result in kidney failure.  Individuals with Ochoa syndrome also exhibit a characteristic frown-like facial grimace when they try to smile or laugh, often described as inversion of facial expression. While this feature may appear earlier than the urinary tract symptoms, perhaps as early as an infant begins to smile, it is often not brought to medical attention.  Approximately two-thirds of individuals with Ochoa syndrome also experience problems with bowel function, such as constipation, loss of bowel control, or muscle spasms of the anus."

And if not which vaccine should I get, if any ?","Because chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid.  A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule.  The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.  Talk to your provider if you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed. Taking preventive steps right away may be important. Giving the vaccine early after exposure may still reduce the severity of the disease."

6083,"Dear Sir- my wife is suffering from subject since last couples of years, and recently diagnose that she is effected with subject. therefore i need your kind support for treatment and percussion step.  awaiting your kind reply and action. thanks and best Regards","RA most often requires lifelong treatment, including medicines, physical therapy, exercise, education, and possibly surgery. Early, aggressive treatment for RA can with newer drug categories can be very helpful slowing joint destruction and preventing deformities.  MEDICINES  Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are often the drugs that are tried first in people with RA. They are prescribed along with rest, strengthening exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs.  - Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) is the most commonly used DMARD for rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide (Arava) and hydroxychloroquine may also be used.  - Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug that is often combined with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy).  - These drugs may have serious side effects, so you will need frequent blood tests when taking them.    Anti-inflammatory medications: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen.  - Although NSAIDs work well, long-term use can cause stomach problems, including ulcers and bleeding, and possible heart problems.  - Celecoxib (Celebrex) is another anti-inflammatory drug. Drugs in this class (COX-2 inhibitors) may increase heart attack and stroke risk for some people. Talk to your doctor about whether these medicines are right for you.    Antimalarial medications: This group of medicines includes hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). They are most often used along with methotrexate. It may be weeks or months before you see any benefit from these drugs.  Corticosteroids: These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible.  Biologic agents: These drugs are designed to affect parts of the immune system that play a role in the disease process of rheumatoid arthritis.  They may be given when other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis have not worked. Sometimes biologic drugs are started sooner, along with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs.  Most of them are given either under the skin (subcutaneously) or into a vein (intravenously). There are different types of biologic agents:  - White blood cell modulators include: abatacept (Orencia) and rituximab (Rituxan)  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors include: adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), golimumab (Simponi), and certolizumab (Cimzia)  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors: tocilizumab (Actemra)    Biologic agents can be very helpful in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, people taking these drugs must be watched very closely because of serious risk factors:  - Infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi  - Leukemia or lymphoma  - Psoriasis  - Allergic reactions    Other drugs:  - Janus kinase inhibitor: Tofacitinib (Xeljanz). This is a medicine taken by mouth that is now approved for treating RA.    SURGERY  Surgery may be needed to correct severely damaged joints. Surgery may include:  - Removal of the joint lining (synovectomy)  - Total joint replacement in extreme cases; may include total knee, hip replacement, ankle replacement, shoulder replacement, and others    PHYSICAL THERAPY  Range-of-motion exercises and exercise programs prescribed by a physical therapist can delay the loss of joint function and help keep muscles strong.  Sometimes, therapists will use special machines to apply deep heat or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and improve joint movement.  Other therapies that may help ease joint pain include:  - Joint protection techniques  - Heat and cold treatments  - Splints or orthotic devices to support and align joints  - Frequent rest periods between activities, as well as 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night    NUTRITION  Some people with RA may have intolerance or allergies to certain foods. A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided."
6084,Dear Sir. I am [NAME] from India gujarat state. My father is 61 years older suffering with Pancreatic cancer and it's in 3/4 Rd stage. All doctors are help less for us as they told my father can't leave more then 4 months. . I want to take your suggestions and help for my father's Pancreatic cancer. I want to save my father's life . If any type of treatment is available then please help me. Please contact me on my below mobile no.  [CONTACT],"Treatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor.  Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach.  When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended.   When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used.  With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve loss of appetite, jaundice, and itching of the skin."

Thank you, [NAME] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] ","Summary       Osteoporosis makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but it is common in older women. As many as half of all women and a quarter of men older than 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis.    Risk factors include        -  Getting older     -  Being small and thin     -  Having a family history of osteoporosis    -  Taking certain medicines    -  Being a white or Asian woman    -  Having osteopenia, which is low bone density       Osteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health.

6089,"I want more information on Hypertension and fibromyalgia, I seem to be getting only topics on diabetes and I do not have this.   I enjoy reading the current info.  thanks [NAME]","Blood pressure is a measurement of the force exerted against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood to your body. Hypertension is the term used to describe high blood pressure.  Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers. The top number is called the systolic blood pressure. The bottom number is called the diastolic blood pressure. For example, 120 over 80 (written as 120/80 mmHg).   One or both of these numbers can be too high. (Note: These numbers apply to people who are not taking medicines for blood pressure and are not ill.)  - Normal blood pressure is when your blood pressure is lower than 120/80 mmHg most of the time.  - High blood pressure (hypertension) is when your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or above most of the time.  - If your blood pressure numbers are 120/80 or higher, but below 140/90, it is called pre-hypertension.    If you have heart or kidney problems, or you had a stroke, your doctor may want your blood pressure to be even lower than that of people who do not have these conditions."
6090,Question. What is the consensus of medical doctors as to whether asthma can be cured? And do you have an article discussing whether asthma can be cured?,"The goals of treatment are:  - Control airway swelling  - Stay away from substances that trigger your symptoms   - Help you to be able to do normal activities without asthma symptoms   You and your doctor should work as a team to manage your asthma. Follow your doctor's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.  MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA   There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:  - Control medicines to help prevent attacks  - Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks   LONG-TERM MEDICINES  These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.  Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you.  QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES  These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:  - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack  - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise   Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs.  Quick-relief medicines include:  - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators  - Oral corticosteroids for when you have an asthma attack that is not going away   A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).  ASTHMA CARE AT HOME  - Know the asthma symptoms to watch for.  - Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.  - Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when this happens.  - Know how to care for your asthma when you exercise.   Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include:  - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable  - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them  - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your doctor or nurse   A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs.  - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action.  - Peak flow values of 50 to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack."
6091,how to reduced hypertension,"The goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure so that you have a lower risk of complications. You and your provider should set a blood pressure goal for you.  If you have pre-hypertension, your provider will recommend lifestyle changes to bring your blood pressure down to a normal range. Medicines are rarely used for pre-hypertension.  LIFESTYLE CHANGES  You can do many things to help control your blood pressure at home, including:  - Eat a heart-healthy diet, including potassium and fiber.  - Drink plenty of water.  - Exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a day.  - If you smoke, quit.  - Limit how much alcohol you drink to 1 drink a day for women, and 2 a day for men.  - Limit the amount of sodium (salt) you eat. Aim for less than 1,500 mg per day.  - Reduce stress. Try to avoid things that cause you stress, and try meditation or yoga to de-stress.  - Stay at a healthy body weight.     Your provider can help you find programs for losing weight, stopping smoking, and exercising.  You can also get a referral to a dietitian, who can help you plan a diet that is healthy for you.  How low your blood pressure should be and at what level you need to start treatment is individualized, based on your age and any medical problems you have.  MEDICINES FOR HYPERTENSION  Most of the time, your provider will try lifestyle changes first and check your BP 2 or more times. Medicines will likely be started if your BP readings remain at or above these levels:  - Top number (systolic pressure) of 140 or more in people younger than 60 years  - Top number of 150 or more in people 60 years and older  - Bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 90 or more    If you have diabetes, heart problems, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure reading. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 130 to 140/80 mmHg.  There are many different medicines to treat high blood pressure.  - Often, a single blood pressure drug may not be enough to control your blood pressure, and you may need to take two or more drugs.  - It is very important that you take the medicines prescribed to you.  - If you have side effects, your doctor can substitute a different medicine."
6092,How can I relieve dry mouth.,"Treatment for Dry Mouth  Dry mouth treatment will depend on what is causing the problem. If you think you have dry mouth, see your dentist or physician. He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do's and Don'ts Do's - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often. That will make chewing and swallowing easier when eating.  - Do chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow.  - Do use a humidifier at night to promote moisture in the air while you sleep.

Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently."
6093,I am a 75 year old man. I have 2 inguinal hernia. Do you offer any written pamplets on these.,"An inguinal hernia happens when contents of the abdomen—usually fat or part of the small intestine—bulge through a weak area in the lower abdominal wall. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hips. The area of the lower abdominal wall is also called the inguinal or groin region.                  Two types of inguinal hernias are                  - indirect inguinal hernias, which are caused by a defect in the abdominal wall that is congenital, or present at birth  - direct inguinal hernias, which usually occur only in male adults and are caused by a weakness in the muscles of the abdominal wall that develops over time                  Inguinal hernias occur at the inguinal canal in the groin region."
6094,I need to lose fat,"CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE   An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch"
6095,"I am trying to get specific citations for Treatment outcome for PTSD, especially reviews. When I tried to limit using advance search, the response was no finding, which I know is incorrect. Otherwise I get thousands of possibilities. Can you help me limit to that specific  question? ","Treatment for PTSD involves talk therapy (counseling), medicines, or both.  TALK THERAPY  During talk therapy, you talk with a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or therapist, in a calm and accepting setting. They can help you manage your PTSD symptoms. They will also guide you as you work through your feelings about the trauma.  There are many types of talk therapy. One type that is often used for PTSD is called desensitization. During therapy, you are encouraged to remember the traumatic event and express your feelings about it. Over time, memories of the event become less frightening.  During talk therapy, you may also learn ways to relax, especially when you start to have flashbacks.  MEDICINES  Your provider may suggest that you take medicines. They can help ease your depression or anxiety. They can also help you sleep better. Medicines need time to work. Do not stop taking them or change the amount (dosage) you take without talking to your provider. Ask your provider about possible side effects and what to do if you experience them."
6096,What if you do not have surgery to remove a papilloma?,"Treatment of breast papillomas often entails surgical duct excision for symptomatic relief and histopathological examination. Recently, more conservative approach has been adapted. MD-assisted microdochectomy should be considered the procedure of choice for a papilloma-related single duct discharge. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that MD has the potential to reduce the number of duct excision procedures and minimise the extent of surgical resection. Imaging-guided vacuum-assisted core biopsy can be diagnostic and therapeutic for papillomas seen on mammography and/or ultrasound. Patients with multiple papillomas do have an increased risk of developing cancer and should be kept under annual review with regular mammography (preferably digital mammography) if treated conservatively. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be also used in surveillance in view of its high sensitivity. Because the risk is small, long term and affects both breasts, long-term follow-up is more appropriate than prophylactic mastectomy. Patients who prove to have solitary duct papilloma have insufficient increase in the risk of subsequent malignancy to justify routine follow-up. "

6099,pubic lice.  What are some treatments for pubic lice,"MEDICINES  Pubic lice are often treated with medicines that contain a substance called permethrin. To use this medicine:  - Thoroughly work the medicine into your pubic hair and surrounding area. Leave it on for at least 5 to 10 minutes, or as directed by your health care provider.  - Rinse well.  - Comb your pubic hair with a fine-toothed comb to remove eggs (nits). Applying vinegar to pubic hair before combing may help loosen the nits.    Most people need only 1 treatment. If a second treatment is needed, it should be done 4 days to 1 week later.  Over-the-counter medicines to treat lice include Rid and Nix. Malathione lotion is another option.  OTHER CARE  While you are treating pubic lice:  - Wash all clothing and bedding in hot water.  - Spray items that cannot be washed with a medicated spray that you can buy at the store. You can also seal items in plastic bags for 10 to 14 days to smother the lice.  - Makes sure anyone with whom you have had sexual contact or shared a bed is treated at the same time.    People with pubic lice should be checked for other sexually-transmitted infections when lice are discovered."

Why or why not? 3)How can we prevent obesity? 4)What are the benefits of getting 30 minutes of exercise daily and eating healthy? 5)Should the government be more involved in the help to stop obesity? Why or why not? 6)What is the number one thing we should eat less of/ cut out of our diets? (such as, fats, carbs, sugars,etc)  Thank you for your time!","Taking in more calories than your body burns can lead to obesity. This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:  - Eating more food than your body can use  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Not getting enough exercise    Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.  Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally.   The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.   The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.   We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.   - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.  - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.  - People with little free time may have less time to exercise.    The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.  Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:  - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)  - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics    Other things that can cause weight gain are:  - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting.  - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well  - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause.  - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy."
6101,Please mail me information of Lynch Syndrome as I do not have a computer and my doctor has told me that I have this.,"Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that causes an increased risk of developing cancer. Individuals with Lynch syndrome have a higher risk of developing colon and rectal cancer, as well as cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin, and prostate. Women with Lynch syndrome also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (also called endometrial cancer) and ovarian cancer. Even though the disorder was originally described as not involving noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon, people with Lynch syndrome may occasionally have colon polyps. Lynch syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and is caused by a mutation in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM gene."

6107,"Breast cancer at 84.  My mother was just diagnost with breast cancer. She is 84 years old, her tumor started in the milk duct and is small in size, their is a mass as well in the same breast. He is scheduled for a lumpectomy to remove both. Because of age we would like suggestions on treatment options after surgery. ","Treatment is based on many factors, including:  - Type and stage of the cancer  - Whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones  - Whether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses) the HER2/neu gene    Cancer treatments may include:  - Chemotherapy, which uses medicines to kill cancer cells.  - Radiation therapy, which is used to destroy cancerous tissue.  - Surgery to remove cancerous tissue: A lumpectomy removes the breast lump; mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possibly nearby structures.  - Targeted therapy uses medicine to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth.     Cancer treatment can be local or systemic:  - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.  - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.    Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (curing). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.  - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment.  - Stage I and II -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery.  - Stage III -- Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy.  - Stage IV -- Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.    After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment.  Women who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later."
6108,polymicrogyria. My 16 month old son has this. Does not sit up our crawl yet but still trying and is improving in grabbing things etc etc. Have read about other cases that seem 10000 time worse. It's it possible for this post of his brain to grown to normal and he grow out of it?,"Polymicrogyria is a condition characterized by abnormal development of the brain before birth. The surface of the brain normally has many ridges or folds, called gyri. In people with polymicrogyria, the brain develops too many folds, and the folds are unusually small. The name of this condition literally means too many (poly-) small (micro-) folds (-gyria) in the surface of the brain.  Polymicrogyria can affect part of the brain or the whole brain. When the condition affects one side of the brain, researchers describe it as unilateral. When it affects both sides of the brain, it is described as bilateral. The signs and symptoms associated with polymicrogyria depend on how much of the brain, and which particular brain regions, are affected.  Researchers have identified multiple forms of polymicrogyria. The mildest form is known as unilateral focal polymicrogyria. This form of the condition affects a relatively small area on one side of the brain. It may cause minor neurological problems, such as mild seizures that can be easily controlled with medication. Some people with unilateral focal polymicrogyria do not have any problems associated with the condition.  Bilateral forms of polymicrogyria tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Signs and symptoms of these conditions can include recurrent seizures (epilepsy), delayed development, crossed eyes, problems with speech and swallowing, and muscle weakness or paralysis. The most severe form of the disorder, bilateral generalized polymicrogyria, affects the entire brain. This condition causes severe intellectual disability, problems with movement, and seizures that are difficult or impossible to control with medication.  Polymicrogyria most often occurs as an isolated feature, although it can occur with other brain abnormalities. It is also a feature of several genetic syndromes characterized by intellectual disability and multiple birth defects. These include 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Adams-Oliver syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Galloway-Mowat syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Zellweger spectrum disorder."

Surgery may be more risky for people with serious medical problems.   Surgery repairs the weakened abdominal wall tissue (fascia) and closes any holes. Most hernias are closed with stitches and sometimes with mesh patches to plug the hole.  An umbilical hernia that does not heal on its own by the time a child is 5 years old will likely be repaired.

6112,My son had a hemmorhagic stroke at 4 weeks of age....he is now 31 years old.  In the week leading up to the stroke he had a head cold and I had been giving  him infant cold drops.  After he had the stroke the doctors at the time could only say that it was a 'fluke' and would probably never happen again.  The reason for the stroke has haunted me ever since.  Now we just recently found out that my mother has a cerebral aneurysm and they say this can be hereditary.  So my question now is 'did my son have an aneurysm that burst or was it caused by a blood clot?...is there anyway of knowing or getting an answer to that question after the event has happened?,"There are two major types of stroke:   - Ischemic stroke  - Hemorrhagic stroke    Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways:   - A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke.  - A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.    Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.       Watch this video about:   Stroke         Watch this video about:   Stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism     A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:   - Aneurysm  - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)    Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin). Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke.   An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke.  High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are:  - Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation  - Diabetes  - Family history of stroke  - High cholesterol  - Increasing age, especially after age 55  - Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke)        Watch this video about:   Hypertension - overview     Stroke risk is also higher in:   - People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries  - People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and lack of exercise  - Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35)  - Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant  - Women who take hormone replacement therapy"

And how can i help her to get this cured..Please i really need your reply urgently","Summary       Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germs, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia. You can also get pneumonia by inhaling a liquid or chemical. People most at risk are older than 65 or younger than 2 years of age, or already have health problems.    Symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe. See your doctor promptly if you       - Have a high fever    - Have shaking chills    - Have a cough with phlegm that doesn't improve or gets worse    - Develop shortness of breath with normal daily activities    - Have chest pain when you breathe or cough    - Feel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu       Your doctor will use your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests to diagnose pneumonia. Treatment depends on what kind you have. If bacteria are the cause, antibiotics should help. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.    Preventing pneumonia is always better than treating it. Vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu. Other preventive measures include washing your hands frequently and not smoking.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
6116,I have back pain. Please help.,"Most low back pain can be treated without surgery. Treatment involves using over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce discomfort and anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation. The goal of treatment is to restore proper function and strength to the back, and prevent recurrence of the injury. Medications are often used to treat acute and chronic low back pain. Effective pain relief may involve a combination of prescription drugs and over-the-counter remedies. Although the use of cold and hot compresses has never been scientifically proven to quickly resolve low back injury, compresses may help reduce pain and inflammation and allow greater mobility for some individuals. Bed rest is recommended for only 1–2 days at most. Individuals should resume activities as soon as possible. Exercise may be the most effective way to speed recovery from low back pain and help strengthen back and abdominal muscles. In the most serious cases, when the condition does not respond to other therapies, surgery may relieve pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries."

6118,what is the pattern of recovery after stroke?,"How well a person does after a stroke depends on:  - The type of stroke  - How much brain tissue is damaged  - What body functions have been affected  - How quickly treatment is given    Problems moving, thinking, and talking often improve in the weeks to months after a stroke.  Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke.   Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves.  If treatment with clot-busting drugs is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, patients often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these drugs, or they can't take these drugs because of a health condition.  People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).  The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the first stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period."

6122,why is there no info on the withdrawal symptems when stopping pregabalin,"Pregabalin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two or three times a day. Take pregabalin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.    Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of pregabalin and may gradually increase your dose during the first week of treatment.    Take pregabalin exactly as directed. Pregabalin may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.    Pregabalin may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. It may take several weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of pregabalin. Continue to take pregabalin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pregabalin without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking pregabalin, you may experience withdrawal symptoms, including trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, or seizures. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over at least one week.    Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with pregabalin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide."

6129,"i had bad diarrhea over the weekend and though how my mother used paregoric, went to the drug store to get some, he said they dont sell it any more  HELP","In most cases of diarrhea, the only treatment necessary is replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration.                  Over-the-counter medicines such as loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate) may help stop diarrhea in adults. However, people with bloody diarrhea—a sign of bacterial or parasitic infection—should not use these medicines. If diarrhea is caused by bacteria or parasites, over-the-counter medicines may prolong the problem, so doctors usually prescribe antibiotics instead.                  Medications to treat diarrhea in adults can be dangerous for infants and children and should only be given with a doctor’s guidance."

6133,Is the medication Trimethoprim/ sulfamethozle useful in arthritis.?         Thank you,"To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.  Urinary Tract Infections: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.  Acute Otitis Media: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of BACTRIM in pediatric patients under two years of age. BACTRIM is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.  Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults: For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that BACTRIM could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.  Shigellosis: For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.  Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia: For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing P. jiroveci pneumonia.

6134,"Can I go in tub , pool or shower while wearing the lidocaine patch?  If not, can I take off the patch (2or 3), and put a new one on in a different area for the remainder of the 12 hr. ""on"" period","Lidocaine comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is applied only once a day as needed for pain. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use lidocaine patches exactly as directed.  Your doctor will tell you how many lidocaine patches you may use at one time and the length of time you may wear the patches. Never apply more than three patches at one time, and never wear patches for more than 12 hours per day. Using too many patches or leaving patches on for too long may cause serious side effects. To apply the patches, follow these steps:      Look at the skin that you plan to cover with a lidocaine patch. If the skin is broken or blistered, do not apply a patch to that area.     Use scissors to remove the outer seal from the package. Then pull apart the zipper seal.     Remove up to three patches from the package and press the zipper seal tightly together. The remaining patches may dry out if the zipper seal is not tightly closed.     Cut patch(es) to the size and shape that will cover your most painful area.     Peel the transparent liner off the back of the patch(es).     Press the patch(es) firmly onto your skin. If you are applying a patch to your face, be careful not to let it touch your eyes. If you do get lidocaine in your eye, wash it with plenty of water or saline solution.     Wash your hands after handling lidocaine patches.     Do not reuse lidocaine patches. After you are finished using a patch, remove it and dispose of it out of reach of children and pets. Used patches contain enough medication to seriously harm a child or pet. "

The efficacy of bupropion in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in two 4-week controlled trials of depressed inpatients and in one 6-week controlled trial of depressed outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the Major Depression category of the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).  A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies the presence of 1) depressed mood or 2) loss of interest or pleasure; in addition, at least 5 of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning: depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.  The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets USP (SR) in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets USP (SR) for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient."

6137,"Is there any information regarding adults having any benefits from taking Guanfacine extended-release (long-acting) tablets for ADHD?
","Guanfacine tablets (Tenex) are used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Guanfacine extended-release (long-acting) tablets (Intuniv) are used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in children. Guanfacine is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonists. Guanfacine treats high blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. Guanfacine extended-release tablets may treat ADHD by affecting the part of the brain that controls attention and impulsivity.  High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation."

6141,What is Nephrotic Syndrome.  What are its causes and cures?,"Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that indicate kidney damage. Nephrotic syndrome includes the following:        proteinuria—large amounts of protein in the urine      hyperlipidemia—higher than normal fat and cholesterol levels in the blood      edema, or swelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face      hypoalbuminia—low levels of albumin in the blood    Albumin is a protein that acts like a sponge, drawing extra fluid from the body into the bloodstream where it remains until removed by the kidneys. When albumin leaks into the urine, the blood loses its capacity to absorb extra fluid from the body, causing edema.    Nephrotic syndrome results from a problem with the kidneys’ filters, called glomeruli. Glomeruli are tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that remove wastes and excess fluids from the blood and send them to the bladder as urine.    As blood passes through healthy kidneys, the glomeruli filter out the waste products and allow the blood to retain cells and proteins the body needs. However, proteins from the blood, such as albumin, can leak into the urine when the glomeruli are damaged. In nephrotic syndrome, damaged glomeruli allow 3 grams or more of protein to leak into the urine when measured over a 24-hour period, which is more than 20 times the amount that healthy glomeruli allow."

For some, this can present a problem because they do not sense the chest pain that could be the early warning sign of an impending heart attack. When chronic pain enters the picture, the systems that control pain and blood pressure work so poorly that an increase in blood pressure no longer leads to a reduction in pain sensitivity.

6164,Hello i would like more info about Familial Mediterean Fever please as my husband suffers from this. THANKS,"What is familial Mediterranean fever?  Familial Mediterranean fever is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation in the abdomen, chest, or joints. These episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a rash or headache. Occasionally inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart; the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord; and in males, the testicles. In about half of affected individuals, attacks are preceded by mild signs and symptoms known as a prodrome. Prodromal symptoms include mildly uncomfortable sensations in the area that will later become inflamed, or more general feelings of discomfort.  The first episode of illness in familial Mediterranean fever usually occurs in childhood or the teenage years, but in some cases, the initial attack occurs much later in life. Typically, episodes last 12 to 72 hours and can vary in severity. The length of time between attacks is also variable and can range from days to years. During these periods, affected individuals usually have no signs or symptoms related to the condition. However, without treatment to help prevent attacks and complications, a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the body's organs and tissues may occur, especially in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure."

This can damage your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.   Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American women. The cause of lupus is not known.   Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are   Joint pain or swelling  Muscle pain  Fever with no known cause  Fatigue  Red rashes, often on the face (also called the ""butterfly rash"")  There is no one test to diagnose lupus, and it may take months or years to make the diagnosis.

6173,i have lymphoma what causes cramp after chemo treatment,"Side effects of chemotherapy — Most patients who are treated with R-CHOP develop side effects, with the most common including:  ●Fever and low blood count — A potentially life-threatening side effect of chemotherapy is fever and lowered levels of a type of white blood cell, called neutrophils (the condition is called febrile neutropenia).  Anyone who is getting chemotherapy and who develops a temperature higher than 100.4°F (38°C) should immediately call his or her healthcare provider. This condition is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment, usually with admission to a hospital and antibiotics by vein (IV).   ●Nausea and vomiting — Between 30 and 90 percent of patients develop nausea and vomiting after R-CHOP. Several medications may be given before and after chemotherapy to reduce its severity. This often includes dexamethasone and aprepitant (Emend), and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (eg, ondansetron/Zofran, granisetron/Kytril, dolasetron/Anzemet, palonosetron/Aloxi, or tropisetron/Navoban).   ●Hypersensitivity reaction — Hypersensitivity reactions may occur the first time a chemotherapy or immunotherapy drug is given, causing flushing; itching; chest, back, or abdominal pain; fever; nausea; dizziness; and other symptoms. It is not clear why this type of reaction occurs. Several medications are usually given before chemotherapy to reduce the severity of these symptoms, including acetaminophen (Tylenol), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), hydrocortisone (a steroid), and a stomach-acid-reducing medication, such as ranitidine (Zantac).   ●Tumor lysis syndrome — Tumor lysis syndrome is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition that can occur after beginning treatment with chemotherapy. It happens because the tumor cells die quickly and release toxic break-down products into the bloodstream. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, lethargy, blood in the urine, heart problems, seizures, muscle cramps, and others. Preventive treatments are usually given before chemotherapy to reduce the risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome, including IV fluids and medications. In addition, blood tests are often done during and after treatment to monitor for the condition.   ●Other potential complications — Other potential complications of chemotherapy include damage to the heart (called cardiotoxicity) or the nerves (called neurotoxicity), or loss of the ability to have children (infertility). These risks, as well as ways to manage or monitor for them, should be discussed with a healthcare provider before beginning treatment."

We believe my uncle had psp also   He recently passed away ,  I want to give my dad the best treatment available","Is there any treatment?  There is currently no effective treatment for PSP, although scientists are searching for better ways to manage the disease. In some patients the slowness, stiffness, and balance problems of PSP may respond to antiparkinsonian agents such as levodopa, or levodopa combined with anticholinergic agents, but the effect is usually temporary. The speech, vision, and swallowing difficulties usually do not respond to any drug treatment.. Another group of drugs that has been of some modest success in PSP are antidepressant medications. The most commonly used of these drugs are Prozac, Elavil, and Tofranil. The anti-PSP benefit of these drugs seems not to be related to their ability to relieve depression. Non-drug treatment for PSP can take many forms. Patients frequently use weighted walking aids because of their tendency to fall backward. Bifocals or special glasses called prisms are sometimes prescribed for PSP patients to remedy the difficulty of looking down. Formal physical therapy is of no proven benefit in PSP, but certain exercises can be done to keep the joints limber. A surgical procedure, a gastrostomy, may be necessary when there are swallowing disturbances. This surgery involves the placement of a tube through the skin of the abdomen into the stomach (intestine) for feeding purposes.  CUREPSP (Foundation for PSP|CBD and Related Brain Diseases) 30 E.

6179,"I have an aneurysm (2.6cm)for the last 5yrs,last checked about a year ago.experiencing  pain,tighting in abdomen  and chest.should I be going to er.","Once an aneurysm reaches 5 centimeters in diameter, it is usually considered necessary to treat to prevent rupture. Below 5 centimeters, the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is lower than the risk of conventional surgery in patients with normal surgical risks. The goal of therapy for aneurysms is to prevent them from rupturing. Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm has ruptured, the chances of survival are low, with 80 to 90 percent of all ruptured aneurysms resulting in death. These deaths can be avoided if an aneurysm is detected and treated before it ruptures. AAA Treatments  Currently, there are three treatment options for AAA:   Watchful Waiting - Small AAAs (less than 5 centimeters or about 2 inches), which are not rapidly growing or causing symptoms, have a low incidence of rupture and often require no treatment other than watchful waiting under the guidance of a vascular disease specialist. This typically includes follow-up ultrasound exams at regular intervals to determine if the aneurysm has grown.  Surgical Repair - The most common treatment for a large, unruptured aneurysm is open surgical repair by a vascular surgeon. This procedure involves an incision from just below the breastbone to the top of the pubic bone. The surgeon then clamps off the aorta, cuts open the aneurysm and sews in a graft to act as a bridge for the blood flow. The blood flow then goes through the plastic graft and no longer allows the direct pulsation pressure of the blood to further expand the weak aorta wall.  Interventional Repair - This minimally invasive technique is performed by an interventional radiologist using imaging to guide the catheter and graft inside the patient's artery. For the procedure, an incision is made in the skin at the groin through which a catheter is passed into the femoral artery and directed to the aortic aneurysm. Through the catheter, the physician passes a stent graft that is compressed into a small diameter within the catheter. The stent graft is advanced to the aneurysm, then opened, creating new walls in the blood vessel through which blood flows."

An arm lump is a protuberance or localized area of swelling occurring on the arm. Other terms used to describe the various types of lumps include bump, nodule, contusion, tumor and cyst. Arm lumps can be caused by any number of conditions, including infections, inflammation, tumors or trauma. Depending on the cause, lumps may be single or multiple, soft or firm, painful or painless. They may grow rapidly or may not change in size.  Arm lumps due to local infectious causes may appear as boils, or abscesses. Many types of infections cause the lymph nodes to enlarge and feel like lumps, most commonly in the armpits. Traumatic causes of arm lumps range from bug bites to severe injuries that can produce a localized collection of blood in the tissues (hematoma).  Both benign and malignant tumors of the skin, soft tissues, or bones of the arm can sometimes feel like lumps. Lumps caused by infection, inflammation or trauma are usually temporary and subside as the underlying condition resolves. Lumps that persist or continue to grow over time may signal more serious conditions, such as tumors. If you have any lump that is persistent or causes you concern, seek prompt medical care."

B) A lumbar spine front-view X-ray   showing degenerative scoliosis (scoliosis due  to the aging process).  When a spinal deformity is discovered in an adult, it is often quite different from a deformity in an infant or juvenile. The goals for treatment are often different as is the location of the scoliosis. The deformity in an adult may have been present since childhood or may be the result of the aging process.. Besides pain in the back, patients may have pain radiating down their legs. Treatment of spine deformity in adults focuses on restoring function and alleviating pain in combination with correcting the curvature of the spine.   Causes  There are many different causes of spinal deformity in the adult. The most common varieties include idiopathic scoliosis that was present during adolescence (teenage years) and then became worse during adulthood, and deformity that began in adulthood due to degenerative (wear and tear) changes in the spine and deformity that developed later in life. Other less frequent causes include curvatures due to osteoporosis (brittle bones), previous fractures of the spine due to an accident, spondylolisthesis (slipped vertebrae) and rarely, infections and tumors of the spine.5"
6184,How helpful is radiation for melanoma of heel and spread all the way up the leg? Would this effect treatment of trial drugs or other treatments?,"EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY External beam radiation therapy may be used to treat skin cancer itself or to relieve pain from cancer that has spread. Radiation oncologists deliver external beam radiation therapy to the cancer from a machine outside your body. Doctors target the radiation beams at your tumor, giving more radiation to the skin cancer while keeping it away from underlying organs. Skin cancer is often treated with superfi cial forms of radiation. That means the radiation penetrates only a short distance below the surface. Treatment may be given with X-rays or electrons. Treatments are usually scheduled every day, Monday through Friday, for several weeks to accurately deliver radiation to the cancer. Treatments are painless and take less than half an hour each, start to fi nish. Your treatment schedule will depend on your cancer, but it usually requires daily treatments for one or more weeks. Radiation therapy can be given on its own or may also be given in addition to surgery, chemotherapy or biologic therapy. UNDERSTANDING RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy, is the careful use of radiation to treat many diff erent kinds of cancer.  Cancer doctors, called radiation oncologists, use radiation therapy to try to cure cancer, to control cancer growth or to relieve symptoms such as pain.  Radiation therapy works within cancer cells by damaging their ability to multiply. When these cells die, the body naturally eliminates them.  Healthy cells that grow and divide quickly are also harmed by radiation, but they are able to repair themselves in a way that cancer cells cannot.  Most radiation is given with an external beam, but treatment can be given with a radioactive source close to the skin with a treatment called brachytherapy, meaning ‘short-distance’ treatment. POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS The side eff ects you might feel will depend on the part of your body being treated, the dose of radiation given and whether you also receive other treatments like chemotherapy. Before treatment begins, ask your doctor about possible side eff ects and how you can best manage them. Nearly all patients will experience redness and moistness of the skin, similar to a brisk sunburn. After treatment ends, the skin will form a protective scab and the new, healthy skin will develop underneath it. This healing may take several months. You will also likely lose your hair in the area treated. Your hair may grow back, but it might not have the same texture or thickness. Talk to your doctor or nurse about any discomfort you feel. He or she may be able to provide medications or other treatments to help."

Biotene products help for only about two minutes.","Dry Mouth Treatments  Your doctor or dentist may recommend oral rinses and moisturizers, or prescribe an artificial saliva.  Also called saliva substitutes, artificial salivas are regulated by FDA as medical devices. “Unlike drugs, artificial salivas have no chemical action,” says Susan Runner, D.D.S., chief of FDA’s dental devices branch. “Their action is mechanical. They moisten and lubricate the mouth but do not stimulate the salivary glands to make saliva.”  While not a cure, artificial salivas can provide short-term relief of the symptoms of dry mouth. “They can also help minimize discomfort after an oral procedure,” says Runner.  Artificial salivas come in a variety of forms, including rinses, sprays, swabs, gels, and tablets that dissolve in the mouth. Some are available by prescription only; others can be bought over-the-counter.  FDA has also approved several prescription drugs to relieve dry mouth caused by certain medical treatments or conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome and radiation for head or neck cancer.  Advice for Consumers If you have persistent dry mouth: •Talk to your doctor, who may change your medications or adjust the doses. •Talk to your dentist and provide a list of the medicines you take as well as any medical conditions or treatments you’ve had. The American Dental Association recommends seeing your dentist at least twice a year.  Tips for Relieving Dry Mouth •Sip water or sugarless drinks, or suck on ice chips. •Avoid irritants, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. Remember that caffeine is found in many sodas as well as in coffee and tea. •Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free candy. •Avoid salty or spicy foods, which may irritate the mouth. •Use a humidifier in your bedroom at night. •Consider using saliva substitutes."
6186,Dear sir/ madam. I am a patient suffering from Friedreich's ataxia and i heard there was a medicine for it. In 2009 and since we are looking for the medicine kindly help on this and I have DNA report could You please help us on this as there are two people respective age 22 years and 24 years suffering from it. Looking for your help on this ASAP and please let us know when the medicine will be there in market and attaching two files for your reference,"Can Friedreich's ataxia be cured or treated?   As with many degenerative diseases of the nervous system, there is currently no cure or effective treatment for Friedreich's ataxia. However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated to help individuals maintain optimal functioning as long as possible. Doctors can prescribe treatments for diabetes, if present; some of the heart problems can be treated with medication as well. Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with braces or surgery. Physical therapy may prolong use of the arms and legs. Advances in understanding the genetics of Friedreich's ataxia are leading to breakthroughs in treatment. Research has moved forward to the point where clinical trials of proposed treatments are presently occurring for Friedreich’s ataxia.  What research is being done?   Within the Federal government the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has primary responsibility for sponsoring research on neurological disorders. As part of this mission, the NINDS conducts research on Friedreich's ataxia and other forms of inherited ataxias at its facilities at the NIH and supports additional studies at medical centers throughout the United States. Several nonprofit organizations also provide substantial support research (see the section on ""Where can I get more information?"").   Researchers are optimistic that they have begun to understand the causes of the disease, and work has begun to develop effective treatments and prevention strategies for Friedreich's ataxia. Scientists have been able to create various models of the disease in yeast and mice which have facilitated understanding the cause of the disease and are now being used for drug discovery and the development of novel treatments.   Studies have revealed that frataxin is an important mitochondrial protein for proper function of several organs. Yet in people with the disease, the amount of frataxin in affected cells is severely reduced. It is believed that the loss of frataxin makes the nervous system, heart, and pancreas particularly susceptible to damage from free radicals (produced when the excess iron reacts with oxygen). Once certain cells in these tissues are destroyed by free radicals they cannot be replaced. Nerve and muscle cells also have metabolic needs that may make them particularly vulnerable to this damage. Free radicals have been implicated in other degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.   Based upon this information, scientists and physicians have tried to reduce the levels of free radicals, also called oxidants, using treatment with “antioxidants.” Initial clinical studies in Europe suggested that antioxidants like coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, and idebenone may offer individuals some limited benefit. However, recent clinical trials in the United States and Europe have not revealed effectiveness of idebenone in people with Friedreich’s ataxia, but more powerful modified forms of this agent and other antioxidants are in trials at this time. There is also a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of selectively removing excess iron from the mitochondria.   Scientists also are exploring ways to increase frataxin levels through drug treatments, genetic engineering and protein delivery systems. Several compounds that are directed at increasing levels of frataxin may be brought to clinical trials in the near future. To check for current trials, visit http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Additional information is available from the groups listed in the following section.   Armed with what they currently know about frataxin and Friedreich’s ataxia, scientists are working to better define fraxatin’s role, clarify how defects in iron metabolism may be involved in the disease process, and explore new therapeutic approaches for therapy.

Pls i need your advice.","Summary   A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in the kidney from substances in the urine. It may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pearl. Most kidney stones pass out of the body without help from a doctor. But sometimes a stone will not go away. It may get stuck in the urinary tract, block the flow of urine and cause great pain.   The following may be signs of kidney stones that need a doctor's help: • Extreme pain in your back or side that will not go away • Blood in your urine • Fever and chills • Vomiting • Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy • A burning feeling when you urinate  Your doctor will diagnose a kidney stone with urine, blood, and imaging tests.  If you have a stone that won't pass on its own, you may need treatment. It can be done with shock waves; with a scope inserted through the tube that carries urine out of the body, called the urethra; or with surgery.

6188,I have had renal organ transplant surgery a year ago. What risk factos must I avoid to prevent the recurrance of ESRD and to maintain a healthy functioning grafted kidney ?,"Health After Transplantation  KEEPING A HEALTHY OUTLOOK ON LIFE After an organ transplant, there is hope for the future. However, there are a number of health concerns that you will face. For example, there is the chance that your new organ will not always function as well as it should. Transplant recipients also have a higher risk of developing certain conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood lipid levels, diabetes, kidney problems, liver problems, and bone disease. Infection and cancer are also conditions you need to keep in mind.  Some conditions can affect any transplant recipient and some conditions are specific to the type of organ transplanted.    Search:         Healthy Transplant Images    CARING FOR YOUR NEW ORGAN  Lab Tests for Measuring Organ Function It is important to keep all of your scheduled checkups and lab appointments for monitoring organ function. Testing allows your transplant team to monitor the status of your transplant, detect rejection early, and start effective therapy right away OTHER HEALTH ISSUES Anti-rejection medications increase your risk of developing certain conditions such as infection and cancer. Other side effects of some anti-rejection medications include high blood pressure, diabetes, high blood lipids, kidney disease, heart attack, stroke, and bone disease. Knowing the risks and taking steps now to prevent them is a good way to keep you and your new organ healthy. KIDNEY DISEASE Kidney function is often decreased in transplant recipients. This may be caused by a pre-existing condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or injury to the kidney before a transplant. Or it may be caused by medications used to prevent rejection after a transplant.  The best way to help prevent kidney disease is to keep your blood pressure and blood glucose under control and to maintain a healthy weight. In addition, regular checkups with blood and urine tests will give your doctor important information for detecting early changes in kidney function and allowing appropriate steps to be taken. Self-Monitoring In addition to the tests that your transplant team will perform at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-testing at home. Here are some things you will need to monitor: •Weight – Weigh yourself at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. If you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total, call your transplant team. •Temperature – You should take your temperature daily, especially when you feel like you have a fever. Call your transplant team if your temperature is too high. •Blood pressure – Check your blood pressure as often as your transplant team recommends. •Pulse – You should check your pulse daily. A normal heart rate when not exercising should be 60 to 100 beats per minute.

6189,"My question is.what is the treatment  for chronic gonorrhea, massive growth?","Can gonorrhea be cured?  Yes, gonorrhea can be cured with the right treatment. It is important that you take all of the medication your doctor prescribes to cure your infection. Medication for gonorrhea should not be shared with anyone. Although medication will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease.  It is becoming harder to treat some gonorrhea, as drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea are increasing. If your symptoms continue for more than a few days after receiving treatment, you should return to a health care provider to be checked again.  I was treated for gonorrhea. When can I have sex again?  You should wait seven days after finishing all medications before having sex. To avoid getting infected with gonorrhea again or spreading gonorrhea to your partner(s), you and your sex partner(s) should avoid having sex until you have each completed treatment. If you’ve had gonorrhea and took medicine in the past, you can still get infected again if you have unprotected sex with a person who has gonorrhea.  Photo of woman in pain.Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) What happens if I don’t get treated?  Untreated gonorrhea can cause serious and permanent health problems in both women and men. In women, untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are •Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes; •Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the womb); •Infertility (inability to get pregnant); •Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain.  In men, gonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles. In rare cases, this may cause a man to be sterile, or prevent him from being able to father a child. Rarely, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to your blood or joints. This condition can be life-threatening.  Untreated gonorrhea may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV – the virus that causes AIDS."

6191,How can i solve this in life?,"Erection problems  ED drugs are not safe for everyone  Many men now take medications like Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis to treat erection problems. These medications are not safe for everyone. Before taking drugs to treat ED, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks involved.  Never take Viagra, Levitra, or Cialis if you take heart medicines called nitrates. Doing so could cause a sudden — and dangerous — drop in blood pressure. Also, tell your doctor if you take any drugs called alpha-blockers, which are used to treat prostate enlargement or high blood pressure.  Some men have problems getting or keeping an erection. (An erection is when blood fills up the penis, making it firmer and larger.) This problem is called erectile dysfunction, or ED, and sometimes is called impotence. ED is fairly common. In fact, between 15 million and 30 million U.S. men are affected by it. ED can be very upsetting. It can affect self-esteem and cause frustration, anger, and sadness. But there are effective treatments for ED. And counseling can help you and your partner cope with any emotional effects of ED.  Causes of ED include: •Clogged blood vessels, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol •Nerve damage from diabetes •Certain medicines, including some used to treat depression or high blood pressure •Low testosterone •Unhealthy habits like smoking, drinking too much alcohol, overeating, and not exercising •Emotional factors, such as stress or depression  As men get older, ED becomes more common. By age 65, almost 25 percent of men have this problem at least one out of every four times they have sex. But ED is treatable at any age. Your doctor can offer a number of ways to treat ED. If treatment solves your ED, though, you still need to take care of any health issues that may have caused it.  Some men need to try two or three options before they find an ED treatment that works for them. Medication is one popular way to treat ED. Drugs like Viagra increase blood flow to the penis, which helps make an erection possible. Injections to the penis and medicine you put into the tip of your penis also can increase blood flow to it.  Other treatments for ED include a vacuum cylinder and pump you put on your penis to pull blood into it or inflatable rods that are put into the penis through surgery.  You may have heard of herbal products or dietary supplements that claim to treat ED or improve sexual performance. You should beware of these products even if they claim to be ""natural."" They can contain dangerous ingredients, including prescription medications that are not identified on the product's label."
6192,I ask this as a General Question. Can a Pacemaker help prevent these spasms?,"Treatment   The goal of treatment is to control chest pain and prevent a heart attack. A medicine called nitroglycerin can relieve an episode of pain.  Your health care provider may prescribe other medications to prevent chest pain. You may need a type of medicine called a calcium channel blocker or a long-acting nitrate long-term. Your doctor may also prescribe a short-acting nitrate to use during an episode of chest pain.  Beta-blockers are another type of medication that may be used. However, beta-blockers may make the condition worse, and may be harmful if used with cocaine.   Outlook (Prognosis)   Coronary artery spasm is a chronic condition. However, treatment usually helps control symptoms.  The disorder may be a sign that you have a high risk for heart attack or potentially deadly irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias). The outlook is generally good if you follow your doctor's treatment recommendations and avoid certain triggers."

Peyronie’s disease is a disorder in which scar tissue, called a plaque, forms in the penis—the male organ used for urination and sex. The plaque builds up inside the tissues of a thick, elastic membrane called the tunica albuginea. The most common area for the plaque is on the top or bottom of the penis. As the plaque builds up, the penis will curve or bend, which can cause painful erections. Curves in the penis can make sexual intercourse painful, difficult, or impossible. Peyronie’s disease begins with inflammation, or swelling, which can become a hard scar.  The plaque that develops in Peyronie’s disease is not the same plaque that can develop in a person’s arteries. The plaque seen in Peyronie’s disease is benign, or noncancerous, and is not a tumor. Peyronie’s disease is not contagious or caused by any known transmittable disease."

Infertility in men can be caused by different factors and is typically evaluated by a semen analysis. A specialist will evaluate the number of sperm (concentration), motility (movement), and morphology (shape). A slightly abnormal semen analysis does not mean that a man is necessarily infertile. Instead, a semen analysis helps determine if and how male factors are contributing to infertility.   Conditions that can contribute to abnormal semen analyses include—  •Varicoceles, a condition in which the veins on a man’s testicles are large and cause them to overheat. The heat may affect the number or shape of the sperm.  •Medical conditions or exposures such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, trauma, infection, testicular failure, or treatment with chemotherapy or radiation. •Unhealthy habits such as heavy alcohol use, testosterone supplementation, smoking, anabolic steroid use, and illicit drug use. •Environmental toxins including exposure to pesticides and lead. What causes infertility in women?  Women need functioning ovaries, fallopian tubes, and a uterus to get pregnant. Conditions affecting any one of these organs can contribute to female infertility. Some of these conditions are listed below and can be evaluated using a number of different tests."

6205,I have cirrhosis of the liver.  Do high ammonia levels effect breathing?  I have spells of not being able to breath very well. No pain.,"ALCOHOLIC CARDIOMYOPATHY  Long-term heavy drinking weakens the heart muscle, causing a condition called alcoholic cardiomyopathy. A weakened heart droops and stretches and cannot contract effectively. As a result, it cannot pump enough blood to sufficiently nourish the organs. In some cases, this blood flow shortage causes severe damage to organs and tissues. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy include shortness of breath and other breathing difficulties, fatigue, swollen legs and feet, and irregular heartbeat. It can even lead to heart failure.  OTHER ALCOHOL-RELATED BRAIN CONDITIONS LIVER DAMAGE THAT AFFECTS THE BRAIN Not only does alcoholic liver disease affect liver function itself, it also damages the brain. The liver breaks down alcohol—and the toxins it releases. During this process, alcohol’s byproducts damage liver cells. These damaged liver cells no longer function as well as they should and allow too much of these toxic substances, ammonia and manganese in particular, to travel to the brain.These substances proceed to damage brain cells, causing a serious and potentially fatal brain disorder known as hepatic encephalopathy."

Please help me. Thank you,"How is retinitis pigmentosa treated?  There is no known cure for retinitis pigmentosa. However, there are few treatment options such as light avoidance and/or the use of low-vision aids to slow down the progression of RP. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option to slow down the progression of RP. Research suggests taking high doses of vitamin A (15,000 IU/day) may slow progression a little in some people, but the results are not strong. Taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease is relatively weak. More research must be conducted before this is a widely accepted form of therapy.  Research is also being conducted in areas such as gene therapy research, transplant research, and retinal prosthesis. Since RP is usually the result of a defective gene, gene therapy has become a widely explored area for future research. The goal of such research would be to discover ways healthy genes can be inserted into the retina. Attempts at transplanting healthy retinal cells into sick retinas are being made experimentally and have not yet been considered as clinically safe and successful. Retinal prosthesis is also an important area of exploration because the prosthesis, a man-made device intended to replace a damaged body part, can be designed to take over the function of the lost photoreceptors by electrically stimulating the remaining healthy cells of the retina.Through electrical stimulation, the activated ganglion cells can provide a visual signal to the brain. The visual scene captured by a camera is transmitted via electromagnetic radiation to a small decoder chip located on the retinal surface. Data and power are then sent to a set of electrodes connected to the decoder. Electrical current passing from individual electrodes stimulate cells in the appropriate areas of the retina corresponding to the features in the visual scene."

6215,CAN LIPNODES AND OR LIVER CANCER BE DETECTED IN A UPPER GI,"Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. An increased level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood may be a sign of liver cancer. Other cancers and certain noncancerous conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, may also increase AFP levels. Sometimes the AFP level is normal even when there is liver cancer. Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver cancer. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected, to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver. This is called triple-phase CT. A spiral or helical CT scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the liver. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). To create detailed pictures of blood vessels in and near the liver, dye is injected into a vein. This procedure is called MRA (magnetic resonance angiography). Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected, to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver. This is called triple-phase MRI. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Procedures used to collect the sample of cells or tissues include the following: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy : The removal of cells, tissue or fluid using a thin needle. Core needle biopsy : The removal of cells or tissue using a slightly wider needle. Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Another instrument is inserted through the same or another incision to remove the tissue samples. A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose adult primary liver cancer."

What is the probability of one having both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome? Is there any evidence that indicates that the head and neck tics of Tourette syndrome may be a cause of hydrocephalus?","What disorders are associated with TS?  Many individuals with TS experience additional neurobehavioral problems that often cause more impairment than the tics themselves.  These include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder—ADHD);   problems with reading, writing, and arithmetic; and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and repetitive behaviors. For example, worries about dirt and germs may be associated with repetitive hand-washing, and concerns about bad things happening may be associated with ritualistic behaviors such as counting, repeating, or ordering and arranging.  People with TS have also reported problems with depression or anxiety disorders, as well as other difficulties with living, that may or may not be directly related to TS.  In addition, although most individuals with TS experience a significant decline in motor and vocal tics in late adolescence and early adulthood, the associated neurobehavioral conditions may persist.  Given the range of potential complications, people with TS are best served by receiving medical care that provides a comprehensive treatment plan."

6245,"Can a woman catch pelvic inflammatory disease from a dirty toilet seat, such as in a campground or gas station?","The item that may be most feared: the toilet seat. Not surprising as bathrooms are hardly havens of hygiene. What many people worry about is the possibility of acquiring a sexually transmitted pathogen – “venereal disease” (VD), “sexually transmitted disease” (STD), or “sexually transmitted infection” (STI). STI has come into greater use, reflecting that many of these pathogens may be asymptomatic, or cause mild symptoms that may not be recognized as “disease” in infected individuals. While there is certainly cause for concern about rates of STIs (particularly the increasing incidence of multi-drug-resistant gonorrhoea;  also, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and syphilis can lead to serious complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, resulting in chronic pain and/or infertility) toilet seats are not going to put you at risk of these infections.  Why not? Well, microbes have diverse lifestyles. The bacteria that cause chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhoea are transmitted primarily by sex—close contact between skin/mucous membranes. Able to attach to the epithelial cells of the urethra, cervix and other regions of the urogenital tract, these bacteria invade, sometimes spreading to other parts of the body in later stages of infection. Outside of the host, though, these cells are surprisingly fragile, susceptible to stresses of the external environment—ill-equipped to lurk and linger infectiously on the surface of the toilet seat (very different from hardier bacteria that aren’t spread sexually, like E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and many others)"

Considerations  Normal skin contains cells called melanocytes. These cells produce melanin, the substance that gives skin its color.  Skin with too much melanin is called hyperpigmented skin.  Skin with too little melanin is called hypopigmented skin.  Pale skin areas are due to too little melanin or underactive melanocytes. Darker areas of skin (or an area that tans more easily) occurs when you have more melanin or overactive melanocytes.  Bronzing of the skin may sometimes be mistaken for a suntan. This skin discoloration often develops slowly, starting at the elbows, knuckles, and knees and spreading from there. Bronzing may also be seen on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. The bronze color can range from light to dark (in fair-skinned people) with the degree of darkness due to the underlying cause. Causes  Causes of hyperpigmentation include:      History of skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation)     Use of certain medications (such as minocycline)     Endocrine diseases such as Addison's disease     Hemochromatosis (iron overload)     Sun exposure  Causes of hypopigmentation include:      History of skin inflammation     Certain fungal infections (such as tinea versicolor)     Pityriasis alba     Vitiligo  Home Care  Over-the-counter and prescription creams are available for lightening the skin. If you use these creams, follow instructions carefully, and don't use one for more than 3 weeks at a time. Darker skin requires greater care when using these preparations. Cosmetics may also help cover a discoloration.  Avoid too much sun exposure. Always use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.  Abnormally dark skin may continue even after treatment. Experts recommend emotional support or counseling."

6248,Which drug we I take to stop water come out of my nipple,"Nipple discharge Email this page to a friend Print Facebook Twitter Bookmark & Share  Nipple discharge is any fluid that comes out of the nipple area in your breast. Causes  Sometimes discharge from your nipples is okay and will get better on its own. You are more likely to have nipple discharge if you have been pregnant at least once.  Nipple discharge is usually not cancer (benign), but rarely it can be a sign of breast cancer. It is important to find out what is causing it and to get treatment. Here are some reasons for nipple discharge:      Pregnancy     Recent breastfeeding     Rubbing on the area from a bra or t-shirt     Injury to the breast     Infection     Inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts     Noncancerous pituitary tumors     Small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer     Severe underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)     Fibrocystic breast (normal lumpiness in the breast)     Use of certain medicines     Use of certain herbs, such as anise and fennel     Widening of the milk ducts   Sometimes, babies can have nipple discharge. This is caused by hormones from the mother before birth. It should go away in 2 weeks.  Cancers such as Paget’s disease (a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple) can also cause nipple discharge. Symptoms  Nipple discharge that is NOT normal is:      Bloody     Comes from only 1 nipple     Comes out on its own without you squeezing or touching your nipple   Nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it:      Comes out of both nipples     Happens when you squeeze your nipples   The color of the discharge does not tell you whether it is normal. The discharge can look milky, clear, yellow, green, or brown.  Squeezing your nipple to check for discharge can make it worse. Leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop. Exams and Tests  Your health care provider will examine you and ask questions about your symptoms and medical history.  Tests that may be done include:      Prolactin blood test     Thyroid blood tests     Head CT scan or MRI to look for pituitary tumor     Mammography     Ultrasound of the breast     Breast biopsy     Ductography or ductogram, an x-ray with contrast dye injected into the affected milk duct     Skin biopsy, if Paget's disease is a concern   Treatment  Once the cause of your nipple discharge is found, your doctor or nurse can recommend ways to treat it. You may:      Need to change any medicine that caused the discharge     Have lumps removed     Have all or some of the breast ducts removed     Receive creams to treat skin changes around your nipple     Receive medicines to treat a health condition   If all of your tests are normal, you may not need treatment. You should have another mammogram and physical exam within 1 year."

Thanks vili623@gmail.com","Antibiotics     Show All  References Medication Summary  S marcescens is naturally resistant to ampicillin, macrolides, and first-generation cephalosporins. In Taiwan, 92% of the strains are resistant to cefotaxime, but 99% are still susceptible to ceftazidime. Extended spectrum beta-lactamases are produced by most S marcescens strains.[35] International data on antimicrobial susceptibility of Serratia and other nosocomial isolates have been published.[36, 37]  Serratia infections should be treated with an aminoglycoside plus an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, as the single use of a beta-lactam can select for resistant strains. Most strains are susceptible to amikacin, but reports indicate increasing resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin. Quinolones also are highly active against most strains.  Cefepime may be a reasonable option for the treatment of infections with Serratia strains that produce AmpC β-lactamase.[38]  Definitive therapy should be based on the results of susceptibility testing because multiresistant strains are common."

Some people call SIDS ""crib death"" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs.  SIDS is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year old. Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between two months and four months old. Premature babies, boys, African Americans, and American Indian/Alaska Native infants have a higher risk of SIDS.  Although health care professionals don't know what causes SIDS, they do know ways to reduce the risk. These include      Placing babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. ""Tummy time"" is for when babies are awake and someone is watching     Using a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet     Keeping soft objects and loose bedding away from sleep area     Making sure babies don't get too hot.

6251,I'm a mother of a 13 year old girl that has been diagnosed with endometriosis. I know its not spelled right. The doctor stated it was severe and uncommon for children her age. she was 12 when diagnosed is there anything going on for her age? she has not had any treatments and hurts constantly.,"What kinds of treatment are available?  Once a diagnosis of endometriosis has been made, treatment falls into the following categories.  Observation: After an evaluation and before beginning hormonal therapy, you and your gynecology (GYN) team may decide to keep track of your symptoms and try mild pain medicine. This is usually the first step for girls with premenarcheal endometriosis (who are too young to have had their first period).  Medical suppression: Hormonal treatment such as birth control pills containing estrogen and progesterone taken continuously (to stop periods) relieves symptoms in many patients. A second treatment is progesterone medicine alone. This comes as a progestin–only birth control pill in a pill pack (Nor–QD® or Camilla®) or as a regular pill that comes in a bottle Norethindrone acetate (Aygestin®).  The dose of Aygestin® can be adjusted for your body to stop your pain and bleeding. Another type of medication is a GnRH agonist, such as Leuprolide acetate (Lupron–Depot®). This medicine works by shutting off hormones made by the ovaries and temporarily stops your period. The use of GnRH agonist therapy lowers your body’s estrogen level (one of the hormones that causes your body to have periods).  Surgery: Visible endometriosis will be destroyed at the time of laparoscopy. After this procedure, many teens find relief from symptoms. Most say that their pain is better, but not completely gone. Remember, there is no cure for endometriosis. Many teens may experience pain again.  Lifestyle changes: Dealing with chronic pelvic pain can be challenging. Exercising often helps to relieve or lessen pelvic pain and menstrual cramps. Eating a balanced diet and getting enough rest also helps your body manage pain. Practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation help to ease pain too.  Pain treatment services: If you do not have relief from your symptoms, your gynecologist may refer you to a pain treatment program for an evaluation. Following an evaluation, services such as biofeedback, physical therapy, acupuncture and exercise programs may be offered.  Complementary medicine: Acupuncture, herbal remedies, homeopathy and healing touch are among popular “alternative approaches” to medical treatment. Many of these therapies can be helpful however, not every alternative approach has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective. Research studies are limited. Before experimenting with any alternative therapy, make sure that you are working with a licensed provider that has been referred to you."

However, the US Supreme Court has decided that physician-assisted suicide is not necessarily unconstitutional, leaving each state to settle the issue for its residents. For example, physician-assisted suicide has been legal in Oregon since 1997, although experience has shown that it is a rarely used alternative. During the 3 years after this legalization, only 91 people opted for assisted suicide out of 90,000 who died in Oregon during that time. Washington is the only other state which has legalized physician-assisted suicide."

It happens when an injury crushes small blood vessels but does not break the skin. Those vessels break open and leak blood under the skin.  Bruises are often painful and swollen. You can get skin, muscle and bone bruises. Bone bruises are the most serious.  It can take months for a bruise to fade, but most last about two weeks. They start off a reddish color, and then turn bluish-purple and greenish-yellow before returning to normal. To reduce bruising, ice the injured area and elevate it above your heart. See your healthcare provider if you seem to bruise for no reason, or if the bruise appears to be infected."

Keep a record of how many puffs you use each week, how often you use your pre-exercise inhaler for prevention and how often you use it to treat symptoms. If you use it daily or you frequently use it for symptom relief, your doctor may adjust your long-term control medication.  Steps you can take to prevent or minimize symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction include the following:  Do a 10-minute warm-up that varies in intensity before you begin regular exercise. Breathe through your nose to warm and humidify the air before it enters your lungs. Wear a face mask or scarf when exercising, especially in cold, dry weather. If you have allergies, avoid triggers. For example, don't exercise outside when pollen counts are high. Avoid strenuous exercise if you have a cold or other respiratory infection. Exercise regularly to stay in shape and promote good respiratory health."

To get rid of lice, destroy infected clothing or carefully wash items in hot water (at least 130 degrees F), then machine dry using a hot cycle.

An increased appetite can come and go (intermittent), or it can last for long periods of time (persistent). This will depend on the cause. It does not always result in weight gain.  The terms ""hyperphagia"" and ""polyphagia"" refer to someone who is focused only on eating, or who eats a large amount before feeling full.

6262,I will love to try diet I need. To lose weight,"Summary Keeping a healthy weight is crucial. If you are underweight, overweight, or obese, you may have a higher risk of certain health problems.  About two thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese. Achieving a healthy weight can help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar. It might also help you prevent weight-related diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and some cancers.  Eating too much or not being physically active enough will make you overweight. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat. A weight-control strategy might include  Choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods Eating smaller portions Drinking water instead of sugary drinks Being physically active Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet can help to add weight."

6265,I have parasites need help.,"Treatment Options  Drug Therapies    Your doctor will choose the drug that is most effective against your intestinal parasite. You may need one dose, or you may have to take the medication for several weeks. Be careful to take the medicine exactly as it is prescribed, or it may not work.  Complementary and Alternative Therapies    Conventional medical treatments can get rid parasites more quickly and with fewer side effects than most alternative treatments. Alternative treatments may be helpful along with conventional medications. However, your doctor must find out what kind of organism is causing your problems before you start treatment. The following nutritional guidelines may help keep parasites from growing.  Nutrition and Supplements        Avoid simple carbohydrates, such as those found in refined foods, fruits, juices, dairy products, and all sugars, except honey.      Eat more raw garlic, pumpkin seeds, pomegranates, beets, and carrots, all of which have been used traditionally to kill parasites. In one study, researchers found that a mixture of honey and papaya seeds cleared stools of parasites in 23 out of 30 subjects. Drink a lot of water to help flush out your system.      Eat more fiber, which may help get rid of worms.      Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus plantarum, Saccharomyces boulardii, and bifidobacteria). Help keep your digestive tract healthy. Probiotics may not be appropriate in some severely immune compromised patients. Talk to your doctor.      Digestive enzymes will help restore your intestinal tract to its normal state, which makes it inhospitable to parasites. Papain is an enzyme from the papaya plant that may help kill worms when taken 30 minutes before or after meals. Papain may increase bleeding in people with clotting disorders, or in those taking blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin) among others.      Vitamin C. Supports the immune system. Lower the dose if diarrhea develops.      Zinc. Supports the immune system. Zinc may interact with certain medications, particularly some antibiotics, and it may not be appropriate for people with HIV/AIDS. Talk to your doctor. "
6266,Can sepsis be prevented. Can someone get this from a hospital?,Preventing Sepsis There's no way to prevent all types of sepsis.

6267,Need to fix my cross eyed,"Eye muscle repair is surgery to correct eye muscle problems that cause strabismus (crossed eyes).  Description    The goal of this surgery is to restore the eye muscles to a proper position. This will help the eyes move correctly.    Eye muscle surgery is most often done on children. However, adults who have similar eye problems may also have it done. Children will most often have general anesthesia for the procedure. They will be asleep and will not feel pain.    Depending on the problem, one or both eyes may need surgery.    After the anesthesia has taken effect, the eye surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye. This tissue is called the conjunctiva. Then the surgeon will locate one or more of the eye muscles that needs surgery. Sometimes the surgery strengthens the muscle, and sometimes it weakens it.        To strengthen a muscle, a section of the muscle or tendon may be removed to make it shorter. This step in the surgery is called a resection.      To weaken a muscle, it is reattached to a point farther toward the back of the eye. This step is called a recession.    The surgery for adults is similar. In most cases, adults are awake, but are given medicine to numb the area and help them relax.    When the procedure is done on adults, an adjustable stitch is used on the weakened muscle so that minor changes can be made later that day or the next day. This technique often has a very good outcome."

6269,I would like information on timing and exercises that counter sarcopenia. Should exercise take place at a particular time of the day? several times in the day? what types of exercise are most effective to maintain strength as I get older (I am now 82) and even thought I swim daily and do a variety of resistance exercises I still find that I am losing strength and tiring easily.,"What is the best kind of exercise?    Most people tend to focus on one activity or type of exercise.The goal, however, is to be creative and do all four types of exercise—endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. (See ""Healthy Aging with Go4Life"")    Endurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They help keep you healthy, improve fitness, and carry out everyday tasks.    To strengthen your muscles, you need to lift or push weight. Even very small changes can make a real difference. Stronger muscles can make it easier to get up from a chair, carry groceries, open jars, work in the garden, and even play with your grandchildren.    Each year, more than 2 million older Americans go to the emergency room because of fall-related injuries. Balance exercises are one way to help prevent falling.    Flexibility, or stretching, exercises give you more freedom of movement for everyday activities.  How can I find time to exercise?    There are a number of ways to fit exercise and physical activity into your schedule. For example, exercise first thing in the morning, or combine physical activity with a task that's already part of your day, such as walking the dog.  Do I need any equipment?    For many activities, you don't need any equipment or special clothing. All you need for brisk walking, for example, is a pair of comfortable, non-skid shoes. For strength training, you can make your own weights from unbreakable household items.  For more health and wellness information, sign up for free Healthy Aging Tips at NIH Senior Health.  Is it better to exercise in a group or alone?    The key is to do what you truly enjoy, which could be with others or on your own. A team activity like basketball or a group exercise class might be appealing. Or, on their own, some people find going to a gym regularly or working with a trainer helps them stay motivated.  What should people who are overweight or obese do?    Try walking, water exercises, dancing, or weight lifting, varying your activities to include endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Anything that gets you moving—even for only a few minutes a day in the beginning—is a healthy start. Feel good about what you can do, and pat yourself on the back for trying. It should get easier."

These disorders and the sleep deprivation they cause can interfere with work, driving, social activities, and overall quality of life, and can have serious health implications. Sleep disorders account for an estimated $16 billion in medical costs each year, plus indirect costs due to missed days of work, decreased productivity, and other factors.    People who have trouble sleeping often try various dietary supplements, relaxation therapies, or other complementary health approaches in an effort to fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and improve the overall quality of their sleep. Here are 5 things to know about what the science says about sleep disorders and complementary health approaches.        Relaxation techniques may be helpful for insomnia. Evidence indicates that using relaxation techniques before bedtime can be helpful components of a successful strategy to improve sleep habits. Other components include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule; avoiding caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and strenuous exercise too close to bedtime; and sleeping in a quiet, cool, dark room.              Melatonin supplements may be helpful for some people with insomnia or sleep problems caused by shift work or jet lag. Research on the use of melatonin for children is more limited; available research suggests some benefit in children, but those studies were small and only addressed short-term use of melatonin. The long-term safety of melatonin has not been investigated.              Current evidence regarding other mind and body approaches such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (a type of meditation), yoga, massage therapy, and acupuncture is either too preliminary or inconsistent to draw conclusions about whether they are helpful for sleep disorders. These mind and body practices are generally considered safe for healthy people and when performed by an experienced practitioner.              Various herbs and dietary supplements sometimes used as sleep aids, including valerian, kava, chamomile, and L-tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) have not been shown to be effective for insomnia, and important safety concerns have been raised about a few. For example, the use of L-tryptophan supplements has been linked to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a complex, potentially fatal disorder with multiple symptoms including severe muscle pain. Kava supplements have been linked to a risk of severe liver damage.              If you are considering a complementary health approach for sleep problems, talk to your health care providers. Trouble sleeping can be an indication of a more serious condition, and some prescription and over-the-counter drugs can contribute to sleep problems. So, it’s important to discuss your sleep-related symptoms with your health care providers before trying any complementary health product or practice."

[en Español]   The development of communication skills begins in infancy, before the emergence of the first word. Any speech or language problem is likely to have a significant effect on the child's social and academic skills and behavior. The earlier a child's speech and language problems are identified and treated, the less likely it is that problems will persist or get worse. Early speech and language intervention can help children be more successful with reading, writing, schoolwork, and interpersonal relationships.      Birth to One Year     One to Two Years     Two to Three Years     Three to Four Years     Four to Five Years  This information represents, on average, the age by which most monolingual speaking children will accomplish the listed milestones. Children typically do not master all items in a category until they reach the upper age in each age range. Just because your child has not accomplished one skill within an age range does not mean the child has a disorder. However, if you have answered no to the majority of items in an age range, seek the advice of an ASHA-certified speech-language pathologist or audiologist .

Prior to surgery the patient should be in an optimal state both mentally and physically, and factors that impair healing should be minimized. The patient’s ability to tolerate the surgery and participate in the postoperative rehabilitation must be assessed prior to any surgery. Some patients may not be surgical candidates due to malnutrition, immobility, poor compliance with treatment, or chronic diseases.  Operative procedures may include skin grafts or flaps (surgical reconstruction). Which option is available may be limited due to previous surgeries, a shortage of available tissue to use, and impaired blood supply. Immediately after surgery, the operated region must be totally offloaded. Once the surgical incision has healed, the patient will be allowed to gradually apply pressure to the area.  Rates of surgical complications and recurrence rates are high. Complication rates have been reported as high as 49%. Osteomyelitis is the major cause of breakdown after surgery (WOCN, 2010)."

Look for water-based or ""noncomedogenic"" formulas for cosmetics and skin creams. (Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne.)      Remove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising.      Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing.      Shampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily.      Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.     What NOT to do:        Try not to squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples. This can lead to skin infections and scarring.      Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.      Avoid touching your face with your hands or fingers.      Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.      DO NOT leave make-up on overnight.     If these steps do not clear up the blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.        These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid.      They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.      They may cause redness, drying, or peeling of the skin.     A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly, but tanning mostly hides the acne. Too much exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet rays is not recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer.    MEDICINES FROM YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER    If pimples are still a problem, a provider can prescribe stronger medicines and discuss other options with you.    Antibiotics may help some people with acne:        Oral antibiotics (taken by mouth) such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin      Topical antibiotics (applied to the skin) such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or dapsone     Creams or gels applied to the skin may be prescribed:        Retinoic acid cream or gel (tretinoin, Retin-A)      Prescription formulas of benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid      Topical azelaic acid     For women whose acne is caused or made worse by hormones:        A pill called spironolactone may help.      Birth control pills may help in some cases, though they may make acne worse in some women.     Minor procedures or treatments may also be helpful:        A laser procedure called photodynamic therapy may be used.      Your provider may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone.     People who have cystic acne and scarring may try a medicine called isotretinoin (Accutane). You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects.    Pregnant women should NOT take Accutane, because it causes severe birth defects.        Women taking Accutane must use 2 forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program.      Men also need to be enrolled in the iPledge program.

Thank you","Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine. Certain foods may cause gas. Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.  You can reduce the amount of gas you have by  •Drinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinks  •Eating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eat  •Avoiding milk products if you have lactose intolerance   Medicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas.

6296,"hi there i am losing my hair i,m a women by the way and i am getting spots every day big lump spots and now the hairs on my face are now showing they have become coarse please could you help me i dont go out anymore im so ashamed of myself.","Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year.    Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results.    The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss.  Medication    If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months.    Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are:        Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits.        Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia).        Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits.        Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets.    Surgery    In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left.    During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results.    Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring.  Wigs and hairpieces    You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available.    If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor."

6304,I am interested in genetic factors that may affect the risk of developing skin cancer in Caucasian adults.,"Cancers generally are caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. With skin cancer, the environment plays a greater role, but individuals can be born with a genetic disposition toward or vulnerability to getting cancer. The risk is greatest for people who have light-colored skin that freckles easily - often those who also have red or blond hair and blue or light-colored eyes - although anyone can get skin cancer.  Skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to UV radiation, therefore most skin cancers appear after age 50. However, the sun's damaging effects begin at an early age. People who live in areas that get high levels of UV radiation from the sun are more likely to get skin cancer. For example, the highest rates of skin cancer are found in South Africa and Australia, areas that receive high amounts of UV radiation.  About 10 percent of all patients with melanoma have family members who also have had the disease. Research suggests that a mutation in the CDKN2 gene on chromosome 9 plays a role in this form of melanoma. Studies have also implicated genes on chromosomes 1 and 12 in cases of familial melanoma."

In another third of cases, it is because of the man. The rest of the time, it is because of both partners or no cause can be found.  There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve both partners. Drugs or surgery are common treatments. Happily, many couples treated for infertility go on to have babies."

Umbilical, around the belly button Incisional, through a scar Hiatal, a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest. Congenital diaphragmatic, a birth defect that needs surgery Hernias are common. They can affect men, women, and children.

6314,"Can you mail me patient information about Glaucoma, I was recently diagnosed and want to learn all I can about the disease.","Summary Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.  A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years. They include  African Americans over age 40 People over age 60, especially Mexican Americans People with a family history of glaucoma There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. Treatments usually include prescription eyedrops and/or surgery."
6315,Is there any relationship between Leber Congenital Amaurosis and Autism?,"There is much evidence in the literature suggesting that children with congenital blindness can also present autistic like features. The aetiopathogenetic and clinical significance of this association is still unclear. Given the central role played by vision in development, we set out to establish the significance of autistic-like behaviours in children with early-onset severe visual impairment. Our sample comprised 24 children (13 males, 11 females; mean age 5y 2mo; range 2-11y) affected by Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). The results of our administration of a modified Childhood Autism Rating Scale--excluding item VII (Visual Responsiveness)--showed that only four of the children gave an overall score indicating the presence of autism (moreover, of mild/moderate degree). Hardly any of the children in our LCA sample presented major dysfunctions in their relationships with other people or in their social and emotional responsiveness, thus allowing us to exclude a genuine comorbidity with a picture of autism. Indeed, the risk facing the visually impaired child seems to concern their early interactive experiences, which may be affected by their inability to connect with others, and may be prevented through the development of specific strategies of intervention."
6316,I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years.

6335,My son is 33years of age and did not have the measles vaccination.Could SSPE occur at this age or in the future?,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a prototype neurodegenerative disease of childhood characterised by onset of neurological symptoms between 5 and 15 years of age with a progressive downhill course leading to death within 2–4 years.1 The incidence of adult onset SSPE has been reported to vary between 1–1.75% and 2.6%.11,12 To date less than 100 cases of adult onset SSPE have been published in the literature, the majority being case reports2,3,6,7,8,13,14 baring one exception.4 The present series of 39 patients constituted 12.7% of the cohort evaluated over a decade at our centre. To the best of our knowledge this is the largest series of adult onset SSPE patients. Most of our patients were from South India; whether a similar incidence of adult onset cases of SSPE is observed elsewhere in India is not known.  Tan et al4 reported eight cases of adult onset SSPE (⩾18 years) seen between 1980 and 1987 at a university hospital in Turkey. Age at onset was between 18 and 24 years, with a 1–9 month interval between first symptoms and diagnosis. In the published literature on adult onset SSPE, the age at onset was 20–35 years with a mean delay in diagnosis of 10.6 months.5 A similar time lag of 6.3±9.6 months in diagnosis was observed in the present study. In childhood onset SSPE, boys are more frequently affected,1 while in adults the gender distribution is reported to be equal.4,5 However, in our series there was a preponderance of males (25 males, 14 females) (table 2​2)."
6336,"In 1964, I began taking Bendectin for morning sickness and with each subsequent pregnancy I continued to do so. My third child developed a meningioma of the brain at 11 years old and currently, my daughter, 47 years old, has been diagnosed with a lesion(?) of the brain. I am justifiably concerned about my daughter's condition and wonder if I contributed to her status. I am only interested in helping her and not for any litigious reason. If someone also had a similar situation and was treated positively, I would so appreciate knowing about it. Thank you and God bless.","The case against Bendectin is unclear. The Food and Drug Administration admitted as much in 1980, after an intensive two-day review of available data. The review panel said no association between Bendectin and birth defects had been demonstrated. It added, however, that because there was no way to prove the absolute safety of any drug in all women under every circumstance, there must remain a ''residual uncertainty'' about how this drug affects an unborn child."

6342,What happens to someone who has congestive heart failure and their kidneys are in stage 4? Where can I find information on this?,"ECENT FINDINGS:  Congestive heart failure is found in about one-quarter of cases of chronic kidney disease. The most common cause of congestive heart failure is ischemic heart disease. The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases greatly as the patient's renal function deteriorates, and, at end-stage renal disease, can reach 65-70%. There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive heart failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure is often associated with a rapid fall in renal function and adequate control of congestive heart failure can prevent this. The opposite is also true: treatment of chronic kidney disease can prevent congestive heart failure. There is new evidence showing the cardioprotective effect of carvedilol in patients on dialysis, and of simvastatin and eplerenone in patients with congestive heart failure. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs doubles the rate of hospitalization in patients with congestive heart failure. Anemia has been found in one-third to half the cases of congestive heart failure, and may be caused not only by chronic kidney disease but by the congestive heart failure itself. The anemia is associated with worsening cardiac and renal status and often with signs of malnutrition. Control of the anemia and aggressive use of the recommended medication for congestive heart failure may improve the cardiac function, patient function and exercise capacity, stabilize the renal function, reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life. Congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and anemia therefore appear to act together in a vicious circle in which each condition causes or exacerbates the other. Both congestive heart failure and anemia are often undertreated. Cooperation between nephrologists and other physicians in the treatment of patients with anemic congestive heart failure may improve the quality of care and the subsequent prognosis for both congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease."

6345,Yesterday I noticed a large cluster of pinprick red spots underneath my chin (not on my neck). Recently I have been self induced vomiting. I know that Petechiae can be caused by vomiting but would this cause it to be underneath the chin??,"Petechiae are common and may indicate a number of conditions, ranging from minor to very serious.  Tiny blood vessels (capillaries) link the smallest parts of your arteries to the smallest parts of your veins. Petechiae appear when capillaries bleed, leaking blood into the skin. A number of things can cause this bleeding, including:      Prolonged straining     Certain medical conditions     Specific types of injuries     Medications     Injuries and sunburn  See your doctor promptly if you or your child develops unexplained or widespread petechiae.

6347,I have a runny nose and headache and have Graves. What is a safe cold medicine to take over the counter?,"An acute symptom is one that comes on suddenly. Acute problems, such as a headache, postnasal drip, or muscular pain due to exercise, often are not serious conditions, and may be treated with a properly chosen over-the-counter medication. Remember, however, that selfmedication may be challenging if a patient is taking prescription or nonprescription medication. Drug-with-drug interactions are a major reason for complications. When taking thyroid supplements, high-blood-pressure medications, etc., it is always best to consult your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medication. What seems like a simple and safe product for a headache might cause a significant and dangerous combination with some prescription medications. If acute symptoms continue, despite supportive therapies like proper over-thecounter medication, rest (where necessary) and time, a symptom becomes chronic. Chronic problems usually indicate the need for skilled diagnosis that a physician provides. Simply put, if a problem persists, do not continue to self medicate, see your doctor."

6349,"My husband, 89, has been unable to urinate for 11 hours after his catheter was removed. Is it time to call the doctor?","After catheter removal  After your catheter is taken out:      You may have trouble urinating. If this happens, try sitting in a few inches of warm water (sitz bath). This may help you relax. If you feel the urge, it may be easier to urinate while you are still in the bath.     You may have some burning the first few times you urinate. If the burning lasts longer, it may be a sign of an infection.     Drink plenty of fluids, enough so that your urine is light yellow or clear like water. If you have kidney, heart, or liver disease and have to limit fluids, talk with your doctor before you increase the amount of fluids you drink.     Wear loose cotton underwear if you have irritation or a rash from your catheter.  Also, it is important to know when you are having a problem and when to call your doctor. After catheter removal, call your doctor if:      You do not urinate within 8 hours after the catheter is taken out."

Sampling a small piece of skin by using a flexible razor blade, a scalpel, or a tiny cookie cutter (called a ""punch biopsy""). If a punch biopsy is taken, a stitch (suture) or 2 may be placed and will need to be removed 6–14 days later.     Having the skin sample examined under the microscope by a specially trained physician (dermatopathologist).  In addition, your doctor may recommend one of the following treatments:      Topical corticosteroid (cortisone) cream, lotion, ointment, or gel     Topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus     Anti-itch lotions containing menthol, pramoxine, or phenol     Corticosteroid (cortisone) injected directly into a thick lesion     Oral antihistamine pills such as diphenhydramine, loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, or hydroxyzine for itching  In addition, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments for oral lichen planus:      Topical corticosteroid (cortisone) ointment or gel     Topical cyclosporine solution used as a mouthwash  For very severe cases of lichen planus, one of the following therapies may be recommended:      Ultraviolet light treatment     Oral retinoid pills such as isotretinoin or acitretin     Oral cyclosporine pills     Oral hydroxychloroquine pills  Although there is no cure for lichen planus, treatment can usually minimize symptoms and improve the appearance of the rash until it heals."

Hip replacement is one of the most successful orthopaedic surgeries performed. However, because more people are having hip replacements at a younger age, and wearing away of the joint surface becomes a problem after 15 to 20 years, replacement of an artificial joint, which is also known as revision surgery, is becoming more common. It is more difficult than first-time hip replacement surgery, and the outcome is generally not as good, so it is important to explore all available options before having additional surgery.  Doctors consider revision surgery for two reasons: if medication and lifestyle changes do not relieve pain and disability, or if x rays of the hip show damage to the bone around the artificial hip that must be corrected before it is too late for a successful revision. This surgery is usually considered only when bone loss, wearing of the joint surfaces, or joint loosening shows up on an x ray. Other possible reasons for revision surgery include fracture, dislocation of the artificial parts, and infection."
6354,my dad is being treated at University of Washington School of Medicine for infection cause by hole in his urine tract and i am interested in any treats for his problem.,"Intraperitoneal Rupture: If the tear is on the top of the bladder, the hole will usually communicate with the abdominal cavity that holds all of the vital organs (liver, spleen and bowel). This injury should be surgically repaired. Urine that leaks into the abdomen is a serious problem. The repair is performed by making an abdominal incision and sewing the tear closed. A catheter is left in the bladder for up to 2 weeks to rest the bladder after the surgery, either through the urethra or coming directly out the abdominal wall, below the bellybutton.  Extraperitoneal Rupture: If the tear is at the bottom or sides of the bladder, the urine will not leak into the abdominal cavity but into the tissues around the bladder. Patients who have complex injuries of this type should have surgical repair of the injury but in some circumstances small injuries can be treated by simply placing a large diameter catheter into the bladder to keep it empty and allow the urine and blood to drain out into a collection bag. If the catheter does not drain properly, surgical repair is required. Allowing the bladder to repair itself in this fashion usually takes at least 10 days and the catheter is not removed until an X-ray is done as described above to prove the leak has sealed.  Penetrating Injuries: Patients who have injury to the bladder from a penetrating object are usually operated upon and the hole(s) is surgically repaired. Most of the time other organs in the area will be injured and need repair as well. A catheter is left in the bladder to drain the urine and blood as described above."

Adults with Russell-Silver syndrome are short; the average height for affected males is about 151 centimeters (4 feet, 11 inches) and the average height for affected females is about 140 centimeters (4 feet, 7 inches).  Many children with Russell-Silver syndrome have a small, triangular face with distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, a narrow chin, a small jaw, and down-turned corners of the mouth. Other features of this disorder can include an unusual curving of the fifth finger (clinodactyly), asymmetric or uneven growth of some parts of the body, and digestive system abnormalities.

6384,What if you do not have surgery to remove a papilloma?,"Your specialist will be able to advise you of the most appropriate treatment or follow up (further checks) if you have an intraductal papilloma. They may feel that no further treatment is needed after either a core or vacuum assisted biopsy.  However, they may still want to do another operation (excision biopsy) to remove more breast tissue. In some centres, vacuum assisted excision biopsy may be used as an alternative to surgery. Following an injection of local anaesthetic, a small cut is made in the skin. A hollow probe connected to a vacuum device, is placed through this.  Using ultrasound or mammography as a guide, breast tissue is sucked through the probe by the vacuum into a collecting chamber. The biopsy device is used until the area being investigated has been removed. This may mean that an operation under a general anaesthetic can be avoided. The tissue removed is sent to the laboratory and examined under a microscope.  If your nipple continues to produce discharge after surgery, or if there’s inflammation around it, you may need to have a further operation to remove the affected duct or ducts. You may be offered a microdochectomy (removal of the affected duct or ducts) or a Hadfield’s operation (removal of all the major ducts). The operation should solve the problem, but if the discharge comes back more ducts may need to be removed, as finding all the ducts can sometimes be difficult.  The operation is usually done under a general anaesthetic, and you’ll be in hospital for the day or overnight. You’ll have a small wound near the nipple with a stitch or stitches in it, and your doctors will tell you how to look after this and give you advice about pain relief. The operation will leave a small scar but this will fade in time. After the operation your nipple may be less sensitive than before.  After the intraductal papilloma has been removed, follow up is not usually required. However, for some people, a short-term follow up with the specialist may be needed if only a core biopsy/vacuum assisted biopsy has been performed. People with multiple intraductal papillomas and those whose intraductal papillomas contained atypical cells are likely to have follow-up appointments with their specialist for longer."
6385,Thank for your information on my earlier question regarding what is causing skin itching. I have another question on another problem that I'm having.

6386,"I have numbness/tingling in my lower right arm from elbow to my fingers. A EMG has shown nothing abnormal. I have had this for a long time, I need help.","Home Care  Your doctor should find and treat the cause of your numbness or tingling. Treating the condition may make the symptoms go away or stop them from getting worse. For example, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or low back pain, your doctor may recommend certain exercises.  If you have diabetes, your doctor will discuss ways to control your blood sugar levels.  Low levels of vitamins will be treated with vitamin supplements.  Medications that cause numbness or tingling may need to be switched or changed. Do not change or stop taking any of your medicines or take large doses of any vitamins or supplements until you have talked with your doctor.  Because numbness can cause a decrease in feeling, you may be more likely to accidentally injure a numb hand or foot. Take care to protect the area from cuts, bumps, bruises, burns, or other injuries."
6387,we need treatment for balance disorder. my father losses his balance while walking or climbing steps so please so please help us in curing the disorder.,"How are balance disorders treated?  The first thing a doctor will do if you have a balance problem is determine if another health condition or a medication is to blame. If so, your doctor will treat the condition, suggest a different medication, or refer you to a specialist if the condition is outside his or her expertise.  If you have BPPV, your doctor might recommend a series of simple movements, such as the Epley maneuver, which can help dislodge the otoconia from the semicircular canal. In many cases, one session works; other people need the procedure several times to relieve their dizziness. Figure 1: The ear and the vestibular system Dislodging otoconia using the Epley maneuver Credit: NIDCD  If you are diagnosed with Ménière's disease, your doctor may recommend that you make some changes to your diet and, if you are a smoker, that you stop smoking. Anti-vertigo or anti-nausea medications may relieve your symptoms, but they can also make you drowsy. Other medications, such as gentamicin (an antibiotic) or corticosteroids may be used. Although gentamicin may reduce dizziness better than corticosteroids, it occasionally causes permanent hearing loss. In some severe cases of Ménière's disease, surgery on the vestibular organs may be needed.  Some people with a balance disorder may not be able to fully relieve their dizziness and will need to find ways to cope with it. A vestibular rehabilitation therapist can help you develop an individualized treatment plan.  Talk to your doctor about whether it’s safe to drive, as well as ways to lower your risk of falling and getting hurt during daily activities, such as when you walk up or down stairs, use the bathroom, or exercise. To reduce your risk of injury from dizziness, avoid walking in the dark. You should also wear low-heeled shoes or walking shoes outdoors. If necessary, use a cane or walker and modify conditions at your home and workplace, such as by adding handrails."
